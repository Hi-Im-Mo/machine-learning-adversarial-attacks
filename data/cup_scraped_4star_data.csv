Six tumblers were in separate boxes for protection. 3 we're just thrown in tumbled around. I'm very lucky that none fell out of the box! Whoever packed it at the ware house needs a lesson on packing!",4 out of 5 stars review

1/22/2024,Great price. Keeps ice water cold all day. Only complaint would be the handle color is off compared to the cup color. For the price you can't beat it though.,4 out of 5 stars review
7/15/2023,"Love the color. It's well made and keeps things cool in the Arizona heat. It fits in the cup holder just like the Stanley I wish the lid was white or clear and was spill proof around the straw. Be aware you cannot put Stanley lids on this, they don't fit.",4 out of 5 stars review
3/8/2023,"This cup is really nice looking. I got white and I love the color. It is a great, large 40 ounces and keeps my ice water cold all day. The straw has a flexible, rubbery tip, which helps it stay in the straw hole of the lid and makes it easy to drink out of. I like the flexible straw, but my teenager thought it was weird. The only thing I don't like about this cup is that it isn't spilled off at all. If it is tipped sideways water pours out of the middle of the lid where the extra plastic piece connects, in addition to the straw hole. I understand that a lid with a straw will not be completely spill proof, but I think it could be done better. Overall I like this cup a lot and I use it every single day.",4 out of 5 stars review
3/31/2023,"I bought this because the internet told me I needed it. I don’t own a Stanley, and I’m cheap, so a $15 Ozark Trail dupe caught my eye. Plus, the pattern looks like a FL sunset. 

I died when I saw how big it is. My husband says I look ridiculous hauling the giant cup around and it doesn’t fit in my coffee maker (yes I do need a keg of iced coffee, thank you very much). The handle is nice, albeit large like everything else on the cup. The lid screws on and the closure system is intuitive.

The straw is trash though and made this giant cup loose one giant star. It’s like 2/3 plastic and 1/3 flexible silicone. Mine arrived ripped so it’s completely useless. I used one of my large Tervis straws instead, which look extra small in this enormous c...",4 out of 5 stars review

3/11/2023,"The 40OZ VACUUM INSULATED STAINLESS STEEL TUMBLER is a nice looking cup. Quality made. The handle is comfortable for such a large cup. The cup/tumbler doesn't leak when you sip either, that's always a plus. I used it for my coffee while I was at work. The cup/tumbler didn't keep my coffee hot very long. It also won't prevent spills. It's a functional cup/tumbler.",4 out of 5 stars review
3/3/2023,I love that this is stainless steel and it's so big! 40 oz which I didn't realize how large that is it's a really good size cup with a nice handle. The side is stain resistant or it's so sweat resistant or something like that but I like it the blue color is nice too. It does not come with a straw,4 out of 5 stars review
3/2/2023,"This pretty travel mug is huge!  I wanted to see how it would work in the car so I took it when we went on a recent trip.  This mug holds a lot of coffee.   And it does a great job of keeping the coffee hot enough for a long time.  My coffee was still hot 3 hours after I poured it.  It fit in my drink holder even with another smaller travel mug beside it.  However, the handle seems to be on the wrong side of the mug. When I picked the drink up by the handle with my right hand, the straw/drinking hole was on the other side of the mug so I couldn't get to it.  I had to turn the mug handle around to the left and pick the mug up by the side so I could drink out of it without spilling the liquid.  It almost seems to be made for left handed peopl...",4 out of 5 stars review
3/5/2023,The 40 Oz. Ozark Trail stainless steel tumbler is great for camping or everyday use.  It is well insulated.  It is easy to carry with the comfortable carrying handle.  It is super easy to fill with ice and liquid as the opening is large enough to do that.  This also makes it easy to clean.  I also love the large size as it holds 40 Oz of your favorite beverage.,4 out of 5 stars review
3/6/2023,Products from this brand are usually good and this time is no different. I tried this tumbler with cold water and juice so far and the drinks stayed cold for many hours. My one complaint would be the straw. I don't like that the top of the straw is uncovered and the type of material that stuff sticks to. It feels less sanitary because of that but I'll just use it in the house.,4 out of 5 stars review
3/9/2023,Really love this cup. Always need something to keep drinks cold and this does the trick. Place water and ice in cup and it stayed cold for hours. The only downside is that the straw doesn't have a cover. So I keep this one at home as I have to drink lots of water due to my medicine.,4 out of 5 stars review
3/11/2023,"Love the size of this tumbler! Keeps my cold beverages cold and my hot beverages hot. It barely fits in my car's cup holder and the handle is wide and comfortable to hold. Very nice tumbler but I have an issue with the straw. The straw is in two pieces, a 9 3/4"" long semi-clear plastic straw with a 3 3/4"" long silicone sleeve attached to the end. The first time using it I washed all pieces in the dishwasher and upon taking the straw out I noticed the silicone sleeve had slipped all the way up the plastic straw.  I've tried for 2 days to pull out the sleeve again with no luck, it's stuck. I'm not sure why they didn't just make the plastic straw 12-13"" long without a sleeve?",4 out of 5 stars review
3/24/2023,"Effective!
Pros: Spacious. Comfortable holding. Matte finish. Insulated well. 
Cons: the cup's cover is of plastic 
Overall: 4/5
The best feature of the cup is the large quantity that it can hold.  I use it for cold/hot water. The insulated feature works really well and extends the desired temperature. I once used it to hold chicken noodle soup and it kept the temperature well.  I used it several times for camping and got asked by several fellow hikers/campers. I also like how comfortable I feel when holding the cup.  The handle is big but not bulky. The material around the cup and the handle is matte so it feels soft and smooth.  The only thing I wanted to improve is the lid.  I wish the lid could be made of higher plastic quality or somet...",4 out of 5 stars review
3/9/2023,"I like products made by Ozark Trail. They always seem well-made with well-conceived features. This tumbler is no exception. The soft purple color is very pretty. The lining is double-walled stainless steel and the capacity is very large - 40 ounces. The handle feels ergonomically correct and the bottom third of the tumbler tapers in to accommodate vehicle cup holders.

That said, for me personally, as a fairly petite person, I have some reservations. First of all, even empty, it is quite heavy and almost cumbersome when filled with a beverage. It doesn't fit all the way down into either of my car's generous cup holders, so it ends up leaning at a slight angle, hence some potential for spills. The screw-on lid locks into place in such a way ...",4 out of 5 stars review

2/24/2023,"This cup is huge.  With the straw inserted it is 14"" tall.  One of my pics is with it next to a 30oz cup I normally use and it is dwarfed by this one.  The bottom diameter is 3"" so it will fit most cupholders but unfortunately will just barely go in the top of the one in one of my cars which is German, and they don't believe in large cups for some reason.  The handle is pretty sturdy solid plastic that is screwed to tabs on the cup body.  The finish (white on mine) has a soft feel to it.  The top screws on and is gasketed along with a swivel tab that can be positioned for the straw (which has a silicone sleeve that seals against the straw hole), a drinking port, or sealed.  The straw is the only thing I'm not too sure about.  It is flexible...",4 out of 5 stars review
2/26/2023,"The 40Oz Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel Tumbler-Blue is my new favorite tumbler that I currently own. There are many good features about this tumble. First its forty ounces, which is awesome. I always feel like my others are a bit too small for me. This one holds enough to get me through the day much better than a smaller one does. Second thing I like is the handle is actually attached to the cup and not a removable one. I have had issue with handles before and this one is sturdy and secure. Third I like the screw top lid, way better than the press in ones that don't seal well. Fourth is that the lid seals every time all the time. The one downside that I think it has would be the straw. I would have preferred either a metal straw or a sol...",4 out of 5 stars review
2/27/2023,"I absolutely love this Ozark Trail Stainless 40oz. Tumbler, it has a really great lid that you twist on which is great because it helps prevent spills in case you drop it or knock it over, the handle on it is good size as I have larger hands and it accommodates them perfectly. The color of it is appealing and I love the straw that is included with it. Just a great tumbler all around!",4 out of 5 stars review
2/28/2023,This cup is very similar to the Stanley cups I own. The cup fits well in cup holders and is designed nicely. These are lots better and upgraded from the older model tumblers. If you like Stanley's at a discounted price this Ozark brand is pretty darn close!,4 out of 5 stars review
2/24/2023,"If you have never tried an insulated cup, it is a must! This cup is so easy to hold and carry because of its handle. It has a good hand grip that is textured and feels very sturdy. The cup is  large but it will fit in a standard cup holder. This cup keeps your beverage cold for hours! Using this overnight, it still had ice and a cold beverage in the morning. This cup works very well at maintaining temperature even in the heat! If you go to theme parks, zoos, sporting events, anywhere outdoors and want to keep a cold beverage  this is something to really consider. I do wish it included a straw but i didn't have any issues using an extra tall straw. This lid is screwed on so there is no issue with it popping off easily when in use. Lastly, th...",4 out of 5 stars review

1/7/2024,"I love this tumbler! My ice lasts just as long as any Stanley tumbler so I don't think there's any need to spend twice as much money, unless you are a brand fanatic and you need the other name on yours. However, if you're looking for a great quality tumbler at a better price, I highly recommend this one! 

I am deducting one star because of the straw. It was a weird mix of silicone and plastic, neither of which appeals to me. I purchased some suitable metal straws and that is what I use with my tumbler instead.",4 out of 5 stars review
2/26/2023,This is great for taking o the go. The insulated tumbler keeps my drinks nice and cold for up to 12 hrs. The straw and lid are easy to remove and clean. I can put this in the dishwasher on the days I don't feel like hand cleaning.,4 out of 5 stars review

1/27/2024,"I love the color and having a handle is great, so much easier to pick it up and carry it. Being a big mug, filling it makes its heavy. The handle is a secure and non painful way to handle it. The straw is two pieces, the bottom portion is a regular straw and has to be inserted from the bottom of the lid. The top piece is flexible and needs to be placed over the bottom straw from the top of the lid. The seams on the top portion of the straw are very noticeable when taking a sip. It is a screw on lid which is my only issue with this mug. It is hard to line it up perfectly to start the screwing and in order to get the straw in the right place for me to drink while holding it by the handle, I need to start the screw 3/4 around the top. I really...",4 out of 5 stars review
1/28/2024,"This keeps my ice all day while working and is a very Barbie pink. The price of $20 versus the $40 for the Stanley Cup we're pretty much the same product as what I like.

1/27/2024,"I needed something light weight with a comfortable handle, and this item works out great for both. It doesnt keep ice for as long as ""other"" brands but does keep ice long enough for me.

2/5/2024,The cup itself is great. Love the color it holds a lot and keeps it cool. The straw however comes with the cylinder cover I guess and you have to put it on the straw otherwise the straw is not long enough and you cannot sip the beverage. And drinking out of it is difficult because the straw collapses. Will have to buy separate straw,4 out of 5 stars review
2/7/2024,"This tumbler does a wonderful job at keeping beverages, cold, and also a very durable however, if tipped over and not picked up soon, it will leak the entire contents of the cup. I still believe this is an absolutely great cup. It just has a minor flaw.",4 out of 5 stars review
1/29/2024,"Slipped on ice with this cup, and it didn't even get a dent or a scratch. Seems to be a great cup. Keeps ice even overnight and hot drinks stay warm all day. The straw is a bit weird, the very top portion is silicone and slightly larger than the opening in the lid. I believe it's to make a pretty tight seal to prevent leaks, but sometimes causes very small silicone shavings--especially if you change back and forth between using the straw or not. Be sure to buy a straw cleaner and maybe an extra pack of straws because you just get one with the purchase. Overall, would purchase again.",4 out of 5 stars review
9/9/2023,"I have had this for 6 months now. It doesn't keep ice cold as long as it did when I first got it. I never put it in the dishwasher. I love the grooved handle! I looked at many other 40 oz cups and wasn't able to find a single other one like this. It may not keep ice as cold as long as the name brand but is way cheaper and that handle wins! Let's also mention the interchangeable top. Happy accident I discovered that the lids for all my ozark trail 30oz tumblers fit in this!! I am not a huge fan of screw on lids in general, so this was awesome!!!",4 out of 5 stars review
3/2/2023,"This is a nice big cup!! I love the Ozark Trail tumblers and the handle on this one is very handy.  It's a 40oz mug so when it's got coffee or water or whatever you enjoy, it can be pretty heavy.  
The weight when full is 3.77 lbs so buy 2 of these and work out both your arms.  ;-) 
I was hoping the piece on the lid would be able to close off the drink hole to prevent spills, but it's not water-tight. 
I love the flexible end, connected to the included straw. It's soft and bends without cutting off the flow of coffee, water, sparkling water, or whatever.  You can use the tumbler with or without the straw.  Works well as a stirring stick, too. 
The base is a good size to fit in my car cup-holder.  Only thing I didn't like was the straw was o...",4 out of 5 stars review

Pros: Arrived quicker than estimated delivery time %26 as pictured, no chips in coating.  Holds 40 oz. and keeps drinks ice cold for 6-8 hours before ice starts to melt.  Keeps hot drinks hot for 4-5 hours.  Fits in standard cup holders %26 is lightweight.
Cons:My sole criticism of this cup is the lid can stick and is difficult to screw and unscrew.  Even if your lid were to get stuck %26 you had to buy another, it'd still be well worth it as it's the same quality as that other brand for 1/3 of the price.",4 out of 5 stars review

11/13/2023,"I love the design, the color and the size of this cup. It does keep my drink cold for a while however, not as long as other cups have there is a good to keep most of it. Cool for most of the day?yes. And for $20 you can't go wrong.",4 out of 5 stars review
12/8/2023,It states that hot drinks stay hot for 6 hours but that's cap. More like three hours but other than that durability is great. I never used the straw but nice addition to the product. Hand wash if you don't want peeling.,4 out of 5 stars review
11/6/2023,Love this cup. keeps my drinks very cold. the outside finish began to peel a bit after using it every day form months but still worked great. Ice stayed cold even overnight!,4 out of 5 stars review
12/8/2023,Ice melts extremely slowly. Most people will like that but I like mine to melt so I get more water to drink. Weird quirk of mine.  Cup is pretty tall too and heavy duty. I'm sure it will last the rest of my life if the lid lasts.,4 out of 5 stars review
12/5/2023,"I really love this cup, easy to hold, light weight for the amount of ounces, but it scratches so easily. The coating is silky coating. It keeps ice melted for about 24 hours maybe.",4 out of 5 stars review
11/30/2023,"This is just like a Stanley cup but I like it better because of the colors.  Be beware it is really heavy once you have liquid in it, but that's the case no matter what tumbler you would use.  Keeps liquid cold for me too for at least 12 hours.",4 out of 5 stars review

9/8/2023,Cold drinks stay cold for a very long time. The only downfall I think this product has is that the liquid leaks out of the top if it tips over. It would be nice to have a seal around the straw.,4 out of 5 stars review
10/17/2023,It's definitely not a leading brand that's 3xs as much. Keeps ice and water cold. Threw out the ridiculous silicone straw that came with the cup and replaced it. All in all the cup is good.,4 out of 5 stars review
10/9/2023,"The cup is heavy, could be a weapon in a pinch. The ice stays frozen about half of the day. I'm not sure why the straw is short, you have to dig it out. Maybe I got the wrong size sent with the 40 ounce cup.",4 out of 5 stars review
7/21/2023,Very pretty. I like the soft silicone top straw. It doesn't actually stay cold as long as my other Ozark trail tumblers though. It's also not spill proof at all. I have other tumblers that other than the straw are pretty air tight,4 out of 5 stars review

10/23/2023,this doesn't have a metal handle like my Stanley but keeps my drink cold like it for half the price. I prefer this silcon straw and I wasn't sure if I would. You really will enjoy this.,4 out of 5 stars review
7/2/2023,"Good cup, but the straw was a no for me. The tip is flexible and I didn't like it. I had to order straws on Amazon.  Other tgan that it's a great Stanley dupe!",4 out of 5 stars review
7/21/2023,This thing can hold a ton of water. Perfect to take to work. The only down side is that over time the lid does not screw on properly. The hole where the straw goes is close to the handle. Otherwise it's good quality for a great price.,4 out of 5 stars review

7/26/2023,Love the tumbler but it was delivered in a bag with the straw sticking up so I accidentally cut the end off the straw when I opened it.  Not as nice as the original but a good dupe.,4 out of 5 stars review
10/20/2023,These cups are good for the price. They keep drinks cold for sure. The matte finish makes stains appear easily and the handles will come loose at the slightest drop.,4 out of 5 stars review
10/2/2023,This is a great cup. The only complaint I have is it's not leak proof. The top could use a redesign to prevent this and it would be 5 star perfect! But I wouldn't let that keep me from purchasing it. Just don't knock it over. Haha,4 out of 5 stars review
8/5/2023,"It doesn't save ice very well but keeps drinks cold for a long time. Downfall is that it can/will spill if you accidentally tip it over, even the slightest bit. Amazing color and very trendy.",4 out of 5 stars review
8/24/2023,"It keeps things cold, Like every vacuum tumbler.  The handle is screwed on, so it's not the best, and the lid needs quite a few turns before being secure. But it's a good cup.",4 out of 5 stars review
8/6/2023,It's okay for the price if you're too cheap for a Stanley. Dislike how there's an opening for sipping under the straw opening that doesn't seal completely.,4 out of 5 stars review
9/13/2023,Perfect dupe!  May not be as insulated as the original but works perfectly for me which is why 4 stars instead of 5. I drink the water so fast that it doesn't need to stay cold for 48 hours. It stays cold overnight which is good enough for me.,4 out of 5 stars review
8/2/2023,This seems like a nice dupe cup! Only thing i could complain about is that the handle seems loose when you take the lid off. Otherwise a great cup %26 will use for a long time.,4 out of 5 stars review
9/10/2023,"Keeps my water cool. Great size. Easy to carry. Sometimes is not easy to close or open.  Besides that, I recommend it for the value of it. Less expensive than many others.",4 out of 5 stars review
7/19/2023,I love the cup but the lid has to screw on certain way putting the straw at the end as opposed to middle of the cup.   Awkward with handle.   Also straw too floppy,4 out of 5 stars review
8/25/2023,"Pretty great cup. Well insulated. I'm not a big fan of the exposed screw heads on the underside of the handle... looks like something that's going to rust pretty easily, so now I need to make sure they don't stay wet.",4 out of 5 stars review
8/26/2023,"Would have given it 5 stars but mine came dented on the bottom, preventing it from sitting upright without wobbling. I was able to hammer the dent out but now it's ugly. That being said, keeps ice for DAYS.",4 out of 5 stars review
6/24/2023,Cup is very nice and the colors are beautiful. Ice stays frozen for about 14 hours for me. I don't care too much for the lid. It twists on and depending on where you start to twist is where it ends up for you to sip from. It doesn't always twist on well. I also don't like the straw. I will replace it will with a full sturdy silicone one. This one is flimsy for the top 1/3 of the straw. Needed a “cheaper than the trendy cup” that fits in my cup holder for an upcoming trip and this will work once I get a new straw.,4 out of 5 stars review
4/8/2023,"I'm pretty pleased with this tumbler. It absolutely keeps drinks cold for a very long time! Plus, you can't beat the price. The only downfall is the lid. It is NOT leakproof like many similar tumblers. The seal is fine around the lid but liquid leaks out from under the slider that covers the straw hole when not in use. I'd give this 5 stars if it weren't for that. Please think about upgrading the lid.",4 out of 5 stars review
5/28/2023,"I love the color,  the way that it feels, and the fact that it holds a lot of water while still fitting in cup holders. That said, the buying process was a pain. I originally bought it weeks ago and that order was eventually cancelled because they ran out of stock. Then I ordered it again and after that order got delayed I was afraid it would also be cancelled, but it finally arrived a couple of weeks later. The cup came with a dent on the bottom so it is pretty wobbly, but with how long it took to get I don't want to exchange it and have to wait even longer to have a cup that I can use.",4 out of 5 stars review
6/8/2023,"Curious as to why the $5 price jump out of nowhere. These are good cups, but they're not Stanley, so why are they now over $20(w/tax)??? Walmart is upping prices on more and more different items, and shrinking sizes, more than many retailers lately, and it's disgusting.",4 out of 5 stars review
6/19/2023,"I purchased 2 of these cups for me and my friend while I was visiting his house...wanted to cheaper option to the Stanley tumbler. Cup keeps water cold, even without ice but the lid can be difficult to screw on and the straw is HORRIBLE...hate the silicone cap on the straw; hence, the 4 stars.",4 out of 5 stars review
3/11/2023,"Don’t love the straw, but I ordered a replacement for the Stanley cups and it fits just fine. I think the idea behind the silicone extender was to prevent leaking from the top. But I’d rather a solid plastic straw. Also, it’s set up to line up with a lefty. So if you hold a cup in your right hand, the straw will be on the opposite side of the cup and if you hold it in your left hand, it will be closest to you, which kind of threw me off but not a big deal. Overall good insulation that holds ice.",4 out of 5 stars review
