3/28/2023,I was so excited for this cup mainly because I can’t afford the “Stanley” one but also this brand has never failed me In the past it always kept my drinks cold for a long period which this does but unfortunately I wanted the handle and fit in my car cup holder which it did but in less than a week of using it the handle snapped where it’s welded prior to it snapping when I first got it the handle always felt slightly loose and wiggly. I’m so sad I really was bragging about how I love this cup:( till this!,2 out of 5 stars review
11/27/2023,"Not a bad cup. I'm not one to use ice, so I'm not sure how insulated it really is. The straw is interesting? And the lid is a bit irritating to get off sometimes, but my yeti is the same way. My main problem is it's supposed to be dishwasher safe. This is only the 2nd time it's been in the dishwasher... ???",2 out of 5 stars review
8/30/2023,"I have ordered this white tumbler twice now and each time it has either been dented or have marks on it which won't scrub off. I don't know if the tumbler was like this before it's placed in the box or if it happened during shipping but if it was just placed in there like this can we get some kind of quality check with our orders?  (I've included a pic, this was after me trying to scrub it clean.)
I'm frustrated because I was hoping to have this for my niece's birthday, but I can't give her a damaged gift.",2 out of 5 stars review
4/6/2023,"For the price, this cup is great! However, I’ve had it about a week and with normal usage, the finish is already chipping off the bottom. I believe this is from simply putting it in the cup holder in my car.",2 out of 5 stars review
3/2/2023,This cup was the perfect size and color. The top of the handle was missing the clip to keep it attached to the cup. This could not have been a shipping issue and was most definitely a manufacturing issue. The cup would've been perfect if not for it being broken and unusable. I have other cups from this brand that perform excellent.,2 out of 5 stars review
10/11/2023,The cup is great all around but within 2 weeks the handle broke off.. :(,2 out of 5 stars review
2/9/2024,"I always have a basic CLEAR chapstick on, but from literally day 1 of using this cup it's stained the silicone straw. It's ridiculous. I regularly wash this cup because I have a rotation of cups I use. There's only ever just plain water in it. No flavored waters. No soda, juice, tea, NOTHING but water. That's it. Why on earth would this straw look so dingy the first day? Especially when it's regularly washed and kept clean and only has water in it?",2 out of 5 stars review
1/15/2024,"This tumbler kept water cold all day, the straw is flexible on top but rigid inside the tumbler, and it feels sturdy. Unfortunately the rubberized coating on the outside became completely tacky and sticky to the touch due to the label/display stickers. Nothing we tried could take the stickiness away, so it's useless now.",2 out of 5 stars review
1/16/2024,"I saw the good reviews on this and thought I would give it a try.   I think I got a dud.  I had high hopes because I have the name brand crazy cup and it holds ice for 48 hours.  With how crazy everyone is being over them I thought this would be a great alternative.  I chilled my cup first and then added a huge chunk of ice to it.   The ice didn't even last 12 hours.   With my “crazy” brand cup, I get 36-48 hours usually.   It was worth a shot, but didn't work for me.  I gave it away.",2 out of 5 stars review
12/11/2023,"I'm pretty upset with this cup, I ordered this for work purposes so that I could drink water. And have a cup that was 40 ounces to have in my car that fit in my cupholder. Of course that will happen, however, I ordered this online and got same-day shipping, it was delivered quickly, but it was delivered without a straw, so I have no straw for this Tumblr.",2 out of 5 stars review
11/27/2023,"Great cup and great sale price.  However, I didn't realize Walmart was going to charge me a $6 under price fee and $25 shipping fee.  I didn't see the fees until I submitted payment and got payment confirmation email.  I would have been better off paying full price at the store.",2 out of 5 stars review
10/31/2023,"I noticed this cup doesn't keep ice near as long as another Stanley dupe that I have. I have another off brand and after putting ice in it and leaving it in my car, it still had ice the next morning. With this cup, the ice is melted within a few hours and it's been inside at my desk.",2 out of 5 stars review
10/20/2023,These were great at first! I liked them so much I bought 3. Now less than 3 months of use and 2 out of the 3s handles have broken. They are too large to not have a working handle so they are useless now.,2 out of 5 stars review

9/24/2023,"Holds ice long over a day. Overall I like the cup, but there are a few disappointments. 1. The cup leaks extremely easily. You just tip the cup ever so slightly, and water is pouring out all over everything. 2. The handle wont tightened. Kinda like someone or something stripped the screws.",2 out of 5 stars review
8/27/2023,"my tumbler arrived in the mail with a shattered lid, in three pieces! This color is out of stock at stores within 50 miles of my house that is why I ordered it for shipping. so, I called customer service, and they gave me a $5.00 off my next purchase of $10.00 or more! I ordered a replacement lid from Amazon  however it does not fit it is to small, also the lid from my Stanley does not fit it either ! I love the color of the cup i wish I had the lid!",2 out of 5 stars review
9/18/2023,"I have no idea about the quality or the function of the cup…the colors are vibrant and it's a great dupe for you-know-who….however, it was “packed” with some ladies boots…very loosely packed…and arrived dented. Had to return. I've ordered a replacement however-the cup is lovely!",2 out of 5 stars review
9/26/2023,Been wanting them to add a handle but of course they went SUPER cheap %26 Chinese on the handle %26 cup. 2 handles broke already in less than 3 weeks. Should have molded the handle into the metal with metal.2 cheap screws into plastic is a joke. Great potential but this model fell short. The old 40 oz is still the best.,2 out of 5 stars review
8/23/2023,"I love the size of the cup and the fact that it fits my cup holder in my car; however, mine does not keep ice at all. The ice even melts within 1 hour inside of an air conditioned home. I have owned the Yeti version Ozark cups and they hold ice well, BUT NOT THIS ONE!",2 out of 5 stars review

10/8/2023,Should've believed the reviews I saw about the handle falling off! Super disappointing when you buy a tumbler with a handle and within 3 weeks there's just an ugly patch of unpainted metal where the handle used to be.,2 out of 5 stars review
10/23/2023,"I bought this as a cheap Stanley replica but its nowhere near a Stanley. This leaks with the lid on, I stopped using this because of how often it would leak and spill in my bag. Spend the money to get something better.",2 out of 5 stars review
6/16/2023,"Although I loveeeee the look of this tumbler, it doesn't keep drinks as cold as others. I have the purple Ozark trail one and it's great. Rec'd this one, filled it with extra ice this morning to make sure I wasn't crazy and sure enough, it's already melted by noon.",2 out of 5 stars review
5/7/2023,"Handle was loose when I picked it up, but I liked the price point. It went through the dishwasher exactly one time before the handle came off completely. Crappy design!
