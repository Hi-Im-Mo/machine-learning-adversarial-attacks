11/10/2023,"it isn't super clear that this straw is in two pieces - the top part is silicone. i much prefer plastic, especially since the top of this straw has an emblem which feels weird when you drink from it. doesnt keep ice particularly colder than other stainless steel bottles. much prefer my Reduce cup instead.",3 out of 5 stars review
11/24/2023,"It's great, but came in a repacked box and not in an original box like the other 9 I ordered. This item is scuffed up and looks like it was pulled off the floor. I'm giving this item away as a gift and will need to go into the store to exchange 
Why would someone send me a scuffed up 20 dollar cup?",3 out of 5 stars review
9/29/2023,"Good size, bigger would have been too heavy when full. There is a small, permanent blue smudge on this one that I can not remove. The cup doesn't keep ice solid as long as I expected, but it's ok. The thing I do not like is that it is hard to position the lid with the straw to a selected spot, right side or left side. The top screws on, hard to control where it stops. I do like the handle, comfortable to hold.",3 out of 5 stars review
12/19/2023,I really liked the tumbler specially because it was a gift for my kids teacher and her favorite color is purple but when it arrived it didn't have the straw,3 out of 5 stars review
4/20/2023,"Filled with ice at 6 o'clock this morning by 10 refilled, just picked up my cup for a drink melt it again
I was able to sublimate on it, so that's a plus
I really like the straw… 
However, I want ice cold water

Not terrible for $15 but not great either",3 out of 5 stars review
3/13/2023,"Keeping ice cold is all that this cup has going for it. The handle is plastic and on the upper handle where the screw is it is cracked, whete the bottle handle connects to the cup it is dented so there is a gap between the handle and cup. Not a very good design.",3 out of 5 stars review
3/6/2023,"This is quite large but not as heavy as a person would think.  It does keep contents warm (started at 180 degrees and maintained for 30 minutes.)  It does not fit in standard car cup holders, unfortunately, which I presume is the reason for the shape.  We tried it both our cars and it did not fit either one.",3 out of 5 stars review

2/9/2024,"No problem w/car cup holder nor breakage of handle.  While other reviews cite the convenience of transfer from fountain drinks into this container, I like my water to stay cold.  This doesn't insulate drinks for long, so I prefer stainless steel.  I had no problems drinking through the included straw, but buying a set of extras is a smart backup.  The lid stays on firmly.  Overall,  I'll get my money's worth more than the highly-touted brand.  it's better than the wastefulness of buying vending machine water.",3 out of 5 stars review
7/6/2023,"Keeps drinks very cold and ice frozen for a long period of time.  I bought this as a joke because my daughter raves about her ""Stanley""... Unfortunately the handle snapped on it after a couple weeks.  I still use it, but its still broken even after trying to reattach.",3 out of 5 stars review
1/6/2024,"I ordered a purple one and a green one. The purple was great! The green one was uneven on the bottom so it rocks when you place it down. Also, the handle is a different shade of green than the rest of the tumbler. It had a faded cheap look to the handle. Very disappointed.",3 out of 5 stars review
1/8/2024,"I ordered this insulated tumbler because it was advertised to be commensurate with the Stanley tumbler that is so popular right now, but much more expensive.  I ordered this in Aqua Blue but what I received is mint green.  There was no packing slip included in my order.  Not good.",3 out of 5 stars review
11/12/2023,"it's a great cup, but the bottom is dented so it doesn't sit straight which is probably not the case for most of these cups but worth saying. also it leaks baaaaaad, but your level of clumsiness/chaos in terms of animals and children determine the level of importance for that.",3 out of 5 stars review
12/18/2023,"This brand is great. Better than all others I have. But there seems to be a design flaw in the 40 oz I just bought. I have a 32 oz that is old but keeps ice all thru the night. The 40 oz I just purchased is top heavy and has fell over many times.  I will not use this one again. I have taken out my old 32 oz tumbler and it still amazes me how well it works at holding ice, day and night.",3 out of 5 stars review
11/19/2023,"This cup was a pretty color, but I did not love the straw. The top of the straw was soft, so it compressed together every time I took a drink. Also, when screwing on the lid, the straw never ended up in the right place so it made it awkward to use the handle.",3 out of 5 stars review
11/23/2023,"First let me say that I'm a cup snob. Initially, I loved this cup so much that I considered buying a second and tossing all of my others. It's that good. Until today. I've now used this cup daily for the last 15 days and today, the straw broke. It's never been out of the cup other than to wash it and then it goes straight back in. I'm not even sure at what point it broke because I was drinking out of it and all of a sudden, my drink wasn't coming through the straw anymore. I opened it up and to my surprise, the side of the straw is busted out. It makes no sense considering how well it has been taken care of. The cup itself is still in fantastic condition - it keeps my water cold for easily 24  hours and I will absolutely continue to use it....",3 out of 5 stars review
4/13/2023,Love the tumbler but I’m really sad that the handle just broke as i was putting the top back on it. I went to pick it up after i tightened the top and the handle broke. Have not dropped it or done anything strenuous to it at all. Literally bought this not even 2 weeks ago.,3 out of 5 stars review
4/16/2023,I bought 2 (blue %26 black) %26 they’re both dented at the bottom so they’re wobbly ): i was so excited for these but i’m worried they’ll fall over %26 dents usually mess up the insulation. It’s hard to tell through picture but the bottoms are bowed from the dents.,3 out of 5 stars review
1/14/2024,It's ok doesn't keep cold for too long but I love the size. It's not leak proof but it works good. I loved the color even more it person then in the pictures.,3 out of 5 stars review
1/20/2024,Was so excited about these tumblers and purchased 3. However I absolutely hate the lids!!! They never go on correctly no matter how many times I try. I get so frustrated trying to put them on I end up using my yeti.,3 out of 5 stars review
10/12/2023,The lid and straw. I have used the tumbler for iced tea. When you fill it with ice the silicone top straw must be laced through the lid hole through the underside. Then the lid is screwed on. The straw hole is to the side not centered I. The lid so the whole mass of ice cubes must be turned with the straw while aligning the screw lid which doesn't align easily with floating ice.  Would prefer a solid plastic or metal straw and a centered straw hole!,3 out of 5 stars review
3/27/2023,"I wanted to like this tumbler so badly, as I love my other cups/coozies from this brand, but sadly I returned it. I didn’t like the top part of the straw, the rubber/silicon collected lint and dust and don’t seem like it’d be easy to keep clean. I would have replaced the straw with something different if I’d kept it. I also was not a fan of the twist lid. I wish it was just a push down lid like the other cups. I tried twisting it on a couple different ways but the straw hole never really hit center like I’d want it to in comparison with the handle. Overall the black color was sleek and it seemed to be very good quality. A new lid and straw and I’d be sold!",3 out of 5 stars review
7/21/2023,"Bought the first one and got home to realize there was a dent in the bottom.   Went back and picked out another one, felt around the bottom for a dent and exchanged.   As I was walking out realized the handle was loose on the one I just bought and had to go back and exchange again.   I would check all aspects of this tumbler before purchasing.     Otherwise I think it is a good product and great value.",3 out of 5 stars review
8/19/2023,"The cup is nice %26 has held up so far after a few weeks of use. It is a tight fit in the dishwasher, but it goes in %26 gets clean. I took off 1 star because the lid can sometimes be difficult to twist off, and 1 star because the handle moves slightly when im trying to get the lid off. I'm worried the handle will eventually fall off, but it's working for now %26 the cup keeps my water cold all day.",3 out of 5 stars review
7/18/2023,it works extremely well at keeping drinks and ice cold for long periods of time (i left my cup of ice water in my car for my entire 10 hour shift in the 100° heat and there was still ice) HOWEVER the handle is cheap and mine broke off within 3 days of having the cup. i still use the cup without the handle but was extremely disappointed.,3 out of 5 stars review

6/12/2023,I bought this as a replacement for one my husband had that had the handle break off after about a month of ownership. I have a purple one of my own and it has a sturdy handle so we figured it was a fluke. This one arrives and has a shaky handle so we will be returning it.

So for same-day use you are going to still have a cold drink all day. One difference I can see is overnight. Why am I drink? Does stay cold the ice does not stay in the cup in melt were in the name brand version overnight I still have ice in the Tumbler. Overall, I think this is a pretty good dupe in a sense if you don't want to spend the money on the brand version I can see there is definitely different quality in the handle of the cup and the weight of the cup but if you're not picky and you just want a large Tumblr for your drink and they should be fine",3 out of 5 stars review

It literally sounds like there is an object rolling around inside the cup. I cannot figure out where the sound is coming from. The handle and screws are still intact. It's quite annoying.,3 out of 5 stars review
1/24/2024,"I love the water bottle. The handle is great, I love the color, it fits great in my car, and I really love the half silicone straw on top.

However, there it's one con, and it's a major one for me. This bottle does not seem to keep ice. Once I fill the bottle with ice and then add water to it, the ice is melted within a couple of hours. If even that long. It's disappointing.",3 out of 5 stars review
1/10/2024,"I got this cup from my father-in-law for Christmas. I love the look and feel AND of course the size, but I am constantly having to replace ice. Like every few hours at least which is disappointing because I'm not always somewhere that I can do that. Plus it's cold outside so I'm guessing during summer it's going to be twice the struggle so I'm definitely disappointed.",3 out of 5 stars review
1/3/2024,The cup is light and easy to grip. The problem is getting the straw in the right place to work for me. The screw top seemed to cross thread or just put the straw in the wrong place. If you don't care about those things this cup is fine for you. I learned I prefer the tervis-type gasket lids to put the straw in just the right place.,3 out of 5 stars review
10/10/2023,"The kids easily crack. Cup is ergonomic and easy to hold and fit in cup holders. The ice stay cold for hours even overnight. However, if you drop the cup at all the kids crack. I've had 3 lids crack just from dropping out of the dishwasher or on the ground. They don't offer replacement lids either. I do like the straws but wish they sold both replacements separately.",3 out of 5 stars review
7/20/2023,"When I first got this cup I loved it. My drinks stayed cold and ice didn't melt for at least 24 hours, sometimes longer. It is annoying that the straw isn't in the middle because I can't always get the straw to line up right (that could definitely be user error). The last thing that recently started happening, my ice isn't lasting as long as it was as before, it will last maybe six hours in my cup. I did accidentally drop the cup, and I am thinking I may have done something to the insulation, but I have dropped it before, and it didn't affect the cup",3 out of 5 stars review
2/1/2024,The 40oz cup is too big. It is difficult to close the screw on lid with ice in the cup and the straw in place.  Grams,3 out of 5 stars review

9/25/2023,Nice large cup that fits in cup holder. Ice melted within a normal work day. This was many days of trying it out. I live where it is hot and it does not keep drinks cold like other brands.,3 out of 5 stars review
6/3/2023,"It's pretty reasonably priced in comparison to others. I'm a tumbler, cup, mug, bottle collector, so this one isn't the greatest but for $15 it's not a bad option. It has a soft texture finish but mine doesn't keep drinks and cold as I'd prefer. It does keep drinks cool but not icy cold like other tumblers I have. If it rips over it will leak. Idk these are pretty popular right now and I'm not sure if I could truthfully say this is the best option for long span cold drinks. It will keep them cool during a 8-10 hour work day but just not icy cold. Matter of fact when I filled it with solid thick ice at 6am at work by 9am my ice was barley visible and had melted the drink was still cool but I don't the the tech this mug offers can keep things...",3 out of 5 stars review
5/25/2023,"This is a great alternative to the expensive tumblers!! Mine works great for holding my ice water all day and fits perfectly in the cupholder. BUT... the photo online is a little misleading. For some, this may not be a big deal but it is increasingly driving me nuts. The photo depicts the tumbler being right-handed with the straw closest to the edge. 

While you can hold the tumbler in your right hand (obviously), the straw is on the opposite side. I checked to see if the lid could be switched over and no matter what I do- it still screws in the same spot. Being a right-handed person, it's annoying to try and switch hands. Also noting that when driving a car, most cupholders are on the right side of the driver. So, when I try to pick this u...",3 out of 5 stars review
