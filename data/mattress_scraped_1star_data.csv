12/30/2023,Walmart sends request to the company for a pick up return. I have scheduled 4 pick up and no one show up. What a waste of time. Inaccurate description of products.

9/17/2020,"They came in ok, but after several months it started to bunch up.  Grandson put a cup on bed and OJ went everywhere.  It bunched up where in the center the springs was visible through the top cover.  Now its has bunched up in two spots and I will include pictures.  I contacted Zinus the company and after giving me the run around for over two weeks they made an executive decision to not send another mattress or a refund.  There people act like they have heard it all before, so don't buy this mattress.  Its terrible and now I have to buy a new mattress and it won't be zinus.  They don't know what customer service is about.  Dont't Buy.",1 out of 5 stars review

12/1/2020,"You get what you paid for. Bought this mattress dec 28, 2018 and just threw it out on nov 30, 2020. It developed a huge indent, in the beginning the top foam layer felt good (for about half a year) and then all I could feel were the springs. My boyfriend and I aren't even heavy people and we couldn't take it anymore after not even 2 years. (I'm 130lbs and he's 160lbs). I would not recommend this mattress.

I was fairly confident, considering the reviews that this matress would be fine, but alas! It's the sort of matress that if you push on the side it pushes right down. It was so bad on the slats that I moved I onto the floor and it still has no body to it.

I was really astounded at how little support it had, I am only 95 pounds and found that this mattress had far too much give.

3/18/2017,I bought this mattress because of the excellent reviews. I tried to deal with it for 2 weeks hoping it just needed to expand or something. It only got worse as time went on.

I rolled it back up and returned it.,1 out of 5 stars review

I prefer a firm mattress, but this was waaay too firm--even with its very nice padding. I really wanted this to work, because it was affordable, easy to manuever, and again, very attractive.

The second one is about 6 months old and begining the same issue.

I originally purchased this matress because of the 10 year warranty, but with all the hastle of disposing of a matress every 8 months is not worth the warranty...

3/3/2017,This is my second time purchasing a matress  from Walmart the first one I had to trew it oway  the mattress had fiber glass and it got all over my house and clothes and it was a nightmare i decided to purchase this one well I flashed my light on this one and what did I see fiberglass I looked at the tag and it's says 30% procent is made out of fiber glass I will have to throw this one oway to i will be not purchasing no more mattress from Walmart the price is good but it's not worth my health and trust me once the fiber glass gets on clothes you will have to trow all your clothes oway you can't wash the fiber glass out of clothes no matter how many times you wash it,1 out of 5 stars review
5/31/2016,"Don't fell in trap about good reviews that's what happen to me, I bought this item for having extra mattress for guest come over.  First i tried to sleep i couldn't sleep more then 3 hours because it's very hard surface i felt like sleeping on the floor even my guests didn't like it so if your body like hard surface then it's nice mattress for you I'm talking about extremely hard that's what it stand for.

7/17/2016,"""What do you mean, popcorn? This is a mattress!"" you say.


Well, I say it's popcorn because it's a lot like a bag of microwave popcorn. You take it out of the box and it pops up like popcorn.  It seems like a neat idea at first, until you sleep on it. 

My old mattress was feeling, well... old, and a bit lumpy. So I was in the market to get a new one. After looking at the pricing on getting a new bed, which means buying both a mattress and box spring at any decent place, I realized I just didn't have the budget for that.

So I looked into this. I looked at all the positive reviews. I mean, nearly 5000, with an average rating of almost 5 stars. So I thought it's got to be fairly decent.

But after two months of sleeping on this thing, I hav...",1 out of 5 stars review
6/13/2016,The frame is week. Its not good for all the matresses. Woods in the frame are thin and make the bed unstable. There should be a bed frame to hold the matress and that would make the structure more stable. I would sure return the bed if i had not thrown away the packaging before setting the bed. I regret the purchase.,1 out of 5 stars review
7/23/2012,"I took a chance on ordering a new mattress without trying it out first. Probably not the best idea.
Ordering online was easy. Delivery came quicker than estimated.

I used it for almost a week just to be sure I liked it.
I didn't.

I personally like a firm mattress and from the one star reviews I read on here from people complaining about how hard the mattress was I figured I'd try it out.
It isn't firm at all. It's like laying on a thick comforter.

The build quality seemed fine. The mattress itself looks like a regular mattress once it opens up fully.
If you like a really soft mattress then you'll love it. If you're looking for something a lot more firm then this wouldn't be it.",1 out of 5 stars review
7/4/2014,"We read the reviews and they were all great, so we bought this mattress last summer. What are we doing a year later? Looking for another mattress. It was a cool idea, you get the mattress in a box and it was neat watching it ""inflate"" when you cut the seal. It was also very comfortable, nice looking and a good bed. Then after a few months it started to ""sag"" in spots. We have huge ""sink holes"" all in the bed, where we have turned it trying to find a more comfortable position. This thing is awful! We are now suffering the worst pain, lower back, shoulders, and hips. Save your money and buy something else.",1 out of 5 stars review

3/16/2015,"I relied on all the reviews and purchased this mattress in a full size. That was a horrible mistake. This mattress is not even fit to use for an occasional guest. When you sit on it, it sinks like a cheep mattress. When you lay on it, it is extremely noisy. You can actually hear all the coils creaking. Not a little - a lot! There is no way 2 adults can sleep on this thing. Wal-Mart needs to discontinue this ridiculous item. Please in the future, keep your reviews honest. I can't believe I'm the only one who received a noisy flimsy mattress. I bought the Slumber 1-8"" Mattress in a Box.

It nearly 8 months later and I'm still miserable and having pains just laying in the bed  ( although,  not waking up in tears anymore).

Worst of all:  ZINUS will NOT honor their warranty even if you email photographs of your cardboard shipping box, purchase receipts, and the very obvious sink hole that spans across the entire bed. 

This mattress creeks and squeaks, which wakes me up when my husband gets out of bed, and he is awakened when I get out of bed.  I weigh 130 pounds and he weighs 180 pounds. 

Our backs hurt and our sleep is disrupted only because of this sunken and noisy mattress -- which began to sink more and more and more after about 3 months.

I bought convoluted egg crate shaped gel-infused cool airflow foam topper, 100% cotton-filled highly breathable mattress pad that you can find on this planet, and 400 count 100% cool cotton sheet, to distance myself from the upper layer of this mattress - now the mattress is bearable to sleep on.

The worst part the mattress company Zinus would not stand by their satisfaction guarantee or their warranty. I then looked to Wal-Mart to correct the situation. Twice they have said they would replace the mattress I've yet to see it. the replacement seems to just sit in pending status but hasn't shipped. been like that for 3 days now.

I let it air out two more days but it wasn't enough, the mattress still smells. It is also very firm so if you don't like a firm mattress don't get this!

After sleeping in that bed for not even 3 days I began experiencing some discomfort in my upper back. I brushed it off at first as well thinking it was just how I sat or maybe I moved the wrong way.

 Never again. I recommend checking ratings on this product from ***low to high*** before deciding. I read only the good reviews and wish I had read the bad ones as well. I would have thought twice. It sinks and tends to clump everything to the middle area. We are not overweight so that can't be the cause.

The mattress is not square -  it's sitting  crooked, at weird angles, as though it is slightly twisted, or as though it was poorly measured and constructed.
