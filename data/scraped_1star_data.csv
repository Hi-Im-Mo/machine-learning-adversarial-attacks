11/22/2023,"I ordered a Vizio 50"" Class V-Series 4L UHD LED TV on the Walmart Website on Nov 14th.  On Nov 16th I received a confirmation that the TV was delivered.  IT WAS NOT.  I have been battling with Walmart ever since.  It is false advertisement and BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE by Walmart when they do not stand by their products that they sell on their website.  Even if it is shipped by the third-party seller.  Walmart should HONOR the sell and ship a replacement item to the customer.  Walmart STILL has the item on thier website and will not ship me a replacement.  Walmart has partnered with the third party sell and should stand by Walmart's commitment to service the customer.  I specifically told several people that I did NOT want a refund and that I wa...",1 out of 5 stars review
12/5/2023,"It didn't work right out of the box. Nothing but vertical and a few horizontal lines. Vizio said it was bad and needed to be replaced by Walmart said I can only return for refund even though they do have a replacement at the store close to me. They delivered it and I had friends set it up since I just had surgery so for me to take apart, rebox and take this 70 inch TV back to the store in my Prius is asking too much. Plus I'll have to deal with the installation of the replacement . Now I've seen people complain about how long it takes Walmart to process refunds and that also isn't fair.

It was never dropped, and this (see attachment) is what I found when I took off the cardboard protection. I never received an invoice for this product.

Driver shows up and says “ I dont see how they expect one guy to deliver this thing - come get it “.  To then notice the TV was hauled laid flat in a truck bed- big no no, says right on box in images to haul vertically ONLY. 
The resolution of the TV seems subpar to expectations.  Our old TCL TV we replaced with this one was about five years old and had a  much better picture.

Now, the second one has network connectivity issues even though my router is only 10 feet from the TV.  This happens about every 20-30 minutes, in the middle of whatever I'm watching, and won't reconnect for 5-10 minutes. No other device in my home has this issue, so I know it is not my wifi.

1/9/2024,"What can I say? This TV only lasted 13 months. Screen randomly went black yesterday. I had my old TV for 10 years and sold it for $50. It was still working great.

Decided to “upgrade” and this thing couldn't even make it 2 years. Vizio couldn't care less. They did nothing. Based on how long this product lasted and based on Vizio's response, I do not recommend you purchase Visio products. There's another company that makes quality products and their stand behind their products.

I will contact Walmart to see if there is anything they can do and I will update this review accordingly.",1 out of 5 stars review

I suspect it was a store demo, and they were passing it off as new because it was beautifully repackaged and looked totally unopened—except there was no protective film over the screen.

Around  April 20, 2023 Vizio did a software update that made it almost impossible to watch my over-the-air channels with my slow and unreliable internet connection. I had to turn the wi-fi off to get them back. Even so, it's very slow to get a picture when I turn on the TV, and there's an annoying menu now too.

5/5/2023,"This is not a technical review of this television, more of a complaint. I'm hoping it will eventually turn out to be a good TV. But there is a major caveat that any potential buyer should be aware of.

The VOC odor of this TV is the strongest of any piece of electronics I've even encountered. As soon as I unpacked it, every one of my family members commented on the awful smell. Within a few minutes, two family members complained of headaches.

I moved it out to my garage. I kept the garage door open during the day to help with the ventilation. The last two days, I've brought it out to my patio in hopes that the sun plus the outdoor breeze would help accelerate the off-gassing. It has not helped.

Purchased and right out of the box the Apple Airplay %26 screen mirror wouldn't work.  Spent about an hour trouble shooting on our own and over 1 1/2 hours on phone with Vizio support.  The firmware was not updated, so all the features do not work, and the TV would not manually update the firmware by factory reset, manual update or via a process that was a pain using a thumb drive.
