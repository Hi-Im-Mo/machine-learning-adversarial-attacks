3/14/2023,"100% Satisfied. works just as good as my Stanley Quencher, and my Simple Modern Trek. However, the straw situation is weird. 2/3 plastic and 1/3 silicone extender, that is tough to remove to clean. I tossed the it and used the straw from one of my others. Overall I highly recommend this, just get different straws for it. I got white because it was all my store had, but I plan on getting other colors!",5 out of 5 stars review
3/8/2023,Good item holds a lot of water came in handy the past few days we had some high temperatures and I was able to keep my water cold for more than six hours outside I love the color and it fits in my lunch box I like that the straw is so long it goes all the way to the bottom of the mug the outside of the mug never sweats it also kept my coffee hot on a one and a half hour drive with no spills great item would recommend to friends,5 out of 5 stars review
2/1/2024,"This cup is a gorgeous purple. My daughter got it as an early Valentine's Day gift. She put some jack %26 sally stickers on it and it looks like it was made that way! Sooo cute! It is rather large but it encourages her to drink her water at a fraction of the cost for a Stanley. Oh, and zero lead üëçüèº",5 out of 5 stars review
1/31/2024,"I love this tumbler and I have 40 oz Yetis and Stanley tumblers.  For this price, you can't beat this Ozark tumbler. I conducted an ice test on all three of these tumblers and even though the Stanley held ice SLIGHTLY longer, it was a tight race between the three.  The Ozark can hold its own against the mighty Stanley and Yeti!",5 out of 5 stars review
4/29/2023,"This cup is perfect. The handle. The tapered bottom that fits in car cup holders. THE COLOR! Who else has been obsessed with lavender purple? My most favorite thing about this cup though? Well obviously the silicone straw. I can't tell you how many times metal straws hit my teeth very hard. Now in the middle of the night when I need water, I don't almost chop a tooth. Also your beverage will stay cold for a good long while. I think I had some last almost 2 days and I don't put too much ice. I like that the outside doesn't get condensation!",5 out of 5 stars review
3/16/2023,"I found the ozark trail version before I was able to get my hands on a Stanley.   The ONLY difference is the OT cup doesn‚Äôt have the rubber grips on the handle and the top of the lid‚Ä¶.and the straw has a silicone extender (which I prefer because I can kind of chew on it).
As far as being sturdy and keeping your drink cold/hot‚Ä¶they‚Äôre the exact same thing.  Same size.  Same everything
It‚Äôs a great dupe!",5 out of 5 stars review
1/23/2024,"Under $20 %26 as hot pink as can be. Ozark is just as good if not better than any cup you gotta wait in line for %26 I didn't pay $200-400 cup. Ordered from the warmth of my house,  delivered to my front door. I did order a different lid, Ozark 40 oz magnetic lid and it fit perfectly. Ordered a few more in different colors. Thank you, Walmart",5 out of 5 stars review
1/7/2024,"I love the way it was packaged and the little Ozark trail emblem in the straw. 
I haven't tried it with ice but I poured soda out of the fridge and it was still cold at least an hour later. And the seal is good so it did well not letting the soda become flat. 
I'm very happy with it. Love the handle and straw and feel of the coating on the outside.",5 out of 5 stars review
1/12/2024,"I love this cup! It looks absolutely ridiculous and I hate the trend, but it works to help you drink a lot of water. I can only carry it in my jeep, this is a HUGE cup! Had a friend laser mine to customize it. What I like more about this one than the trendy original is the straw, it's soft on the outside and hard on the inside. It just works well, and I like mine more than my girlfriend's $70 cup. Buy it!",5 out of 5 stars review
1/15/2024,"Decided to jump on the ‚Äúpink tumbler bandwagon‚Äù, but didn't want to put on my boxing gloves or go broke buying another well known brand.

Would definitely recommend!",5 out of 5 stars review

12/20/2023,"Love my Ozark cup. I don't use the straw for medical reasons-so the only thing I don't like is it's hard to get the lid on right to line up with the way you hold it. Does leak from the drink openings, not the part where lid screws on. But  that's expected from most cups.",5 out of 5 stars review

2/27/2023,"My husband loves his new insulated mug!! Especially the comfortable handle. It holds a lot and is heavy so for an elder person, the handle is great!! He'll use it mainly when he plays golf to keep his ice water cold. We tried it out and still had ice in it the next day! Highly recommend!",5 out of 5 stars review
2/23/2023,This is huge!! I love the look and feel to this! It feels and looks like high quality. I was impressed woth the craftsmanship. This one is 40oz and has a base that was designed to fit in a standard car cup holder. And it came woth its own silicone reusable straw!,5 out of 5 stars review
2/23/2023,"The 40 ounce double-wall, vacuum-sealed stainless steel tumbler by Ozark Trail is my favorite everyday tumbler. It comes in a vary of colors and I chose white. I love that I can use this tumbler for hot or cold drinks, basically all year round! I'm currently using this for iced water to increase my water intake, especially for the summer months coming ahead! Love the shatter-proof and dishwasher-safe lid and drinking straw! Easy to clean and would recommend!",5 out of 5 stars review
2/26/2023,I really like the huge insulted timber/cup. It keeps the ice pretty well for 5/6 hours though it does melt down some. I feel it works better for hot drinks but they do become luke warm. It is so tall they have a rubber extension on the included straw. I use it daily. It's also a pretty pale lavender color which I love.,5 out of 5 stars review
2/25/2023,"My husband is obsessed! He has been bragging how the same ice has been in his cup for two days. He jus keeps adding water. He wasn't sure about the flimsy straw but now prefers it. It's easy to clean. Holds a lot and fits in an average cup holder! 
We went on a Boy Scout adventure and this cup was perfect for holding a big drink through the day. No stopping to buy a drink. I love finding things that are a great buy! I need one for everyone!! What a perfect gift these will be :)",5 out of 5 stars review
2/26/2023,"I have several of this brand of stainless steel drinkware and have never once been let down by quality or function of any of them. 
This will be my new tea and water glass for the summer while working around the house doing yard work and in the car doing one of our many overnighters and day trips to relax after several days of yardwork.
Its well insulated to keep cold stuff cold or hot stuff hot for a good long time.
The lid screws on and can be positioned to use the included straw with the soft silicone very bendy end that makes it easier to take a drink from the large tumbler, or closed once the straw has been removed. 
Unlike some stainless insulated drinkware this is dishwasher safe",5 out of 5 stars review
2/23/2023,This 40 oz mug with built in straw is the absolute best for on my desk. It gives me adequate water during my work shift. It's well made and does not leave condensation on my paperwork. Very well insulated. I am completely satisfied and will definitely be buying more.,5 out of 5 stars review
2/24/2023,"This 40oz tumbler is amazing, it has a see trough lid to see the inside without opening the lid, sturdy and kind of un breakable straw, easy to clean, the bottom can fit in car cup holders but what I like the most of it is the handle because once full can be heavy and would be hard to hold a simple grip with your hands, this will be my favorite tumbler now on",5 out of 5 stars review
2/26/2023,"This goes well with my lifestyle these days. The Ozark Trail tumbler has a massive 40 oz. capacity with a heavy duty handle and screw on lid. The straw is a hybrid of part-sturdy plastic on the bottom and part-bendy (what feels like) silicone on top. The inside is vacuum insulated stainless steel, so it keeps my drink nice and cold for the entire time I'm enjoying it and without any condensation on the outside since it's doubled walled. It's BPA-free and top-rack dishwasher safe!!! It is perfect for my morning iced latte and the best part is I can fit it right in my car cupholder for a fresh cup to go. When I'm done with my iced latte, I just give it a quick rinse and refill it with ice water that stays cold all day. I absolutely love this ...",5 out of 5 stars review
2/25/2023,"Super large travel cup that can be used with a straw (that comes with it) or without. The lid is what really makes this cup useful for me. When you turn the lid it has an opening specifically made for the straw, when you turn it again it has an opening that is bigger to use without a straw, and then when you turn it one more time it seals the opening to keep liquid from leaking. I use this for both my ice coffee and hot coffee.",5 out of 5 stars review
2/22/2023,"This Ozark Trail 40oz tumbler with handle is huge. It will definitely get used a lot during the hot and humid days of summer we have here in the south. This Ozark Trail Matt black tumbler is stainless steel and double vacuum insulated to keep your beverages cold or hot for hours. Its tapered bottom fits nicely in my cars cup holder and I like that it has a handle that prevents it from slipping out of my hand or accidentally dropping it. The removable lid has two openings. One for the included straw and a wider opening to drink from. The tumbler is BPA free and is top rack dishwasher safe. The tumbler boast a ""sweat free"" design and lifetime warranty.

2/27/2023,I received this 40Oz Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel Tumbler-Blue for free in exchange for my opinion. This is one huge cup! It keeps hot beverages hot and cold ones cold! I love that it's stainless steel. It's easy and convenient for me to use! Great cup!!,5 out of 5 stars review
2/23/2023,"The quality of Ozark brand tumblers meets or exceeds any other. Durable, attractive matte black finish, ergonomic handle, screw on lid, keeps your hot/cold beverages how you want them. The straw (while it probably won't outlast a stainless steel mug) is very durable, doesn't crack in cleaning, and comes with a 4"" silicone tip. There is no flap to close the lid, only a round hole for the straw. The lid doesn't leak even in bumpy driving, unless you turn the whole mug upside down. My other Ozark mugs hold about 20 ounces so this one is BIG. In my small car, it's a little too tall and lid too wide to fit comfortably in the center console cupholder because the straw hits the dashboard. It's perfect for a larger vehicle especially when you need ...",5 out of 5 stars review
2/26/2023,"This tumbler is double-wall vacuum insulated and it works very well to keep my drink cold in hot days and hot in cold days. It comes with a plastic twist lid and the opening can be controlled to be open, close, or circle shape (for straws). It features a built-in handle and it's comfortable to hold even when 
 the tumbler is full (max capacity is 40oz, ~1.2L, which is a little heavy). The tumbler design fits my car's cup holder perfectly and I love using this tumbler when we're on road trip. It's also very easy to clean this tumbler as it's dish-washer top rack safe.",5 out of 5 stars review
2/22/2023,"The label came off easily. It is double-wall vacuum insulated, sweat free, BPA free, top rack dishwasher safe, and lifetime warranty.  The handle is part of the tumbler and has finger notches so when you pick it up your fingers fit the handle.  My coffee stayed hot for 1 1/2 hrs.  With a mug, I would have to put it in the microwave several times to reheat it.  I poured water from two 16.9 oz. refrigerated bottles and it kept the water icy cold for over 8 hrs. The lid screws off and has 3 adjustments, one for the straw, one for a larger hole to drink from the tumbler, and one for closing the opening.  An insert describing the lid adjustments would be helpful.   It also fits in the car cup holder.",5 out of 5 stars review
9/12/2023,"I am SHOCKED with how awesome this cup is. I desperately needed a cup to hold cold water after I returned back to work and the air didn't work. This cup went 24 hours keeping the original ice cold. Even when it is really warm out (or warm IN, in my case), the ice still lasts about 12 hours. I love the straw because it is soft and flexible at the top, so I can drink easily from any angle. I HIGHLY recommend it.",5 out of 5 stars review
3/2/2023,"This review is for the ozark trail 40 ounce stainless steel purple tumbler . This tumbler is so sturdy and made heavy to keep your drink hot or cold all day . It's great to take along on walks, or hiking or on long road trips to keep you hydrated and refreshed . it really does hold a lot of whatever is your prefered drink. It has a sturdy handle and a recloseable lid to keep your drink from  spilling. This tumbler has become my new favorite to keep by  my bedside at night to drink my daily amount of water. And better yet it's purple my favorite color . Also it is easy to wash just use hot soapy water.",5 out of 5 stars review
2/28/2023,The tumbler is substantial in size!  Matte paint with 3 transitional tropical colors. Kind of has an 80's vibe. Surface isn't entirely slip proof but much better than a glossy finish.  Kept my beverages at desired temps for over an hour.  Fits perfect in my SUV's cup holder.  Since the lower part of the tumbler is smaller in diameter it's somewhat top heavy. It's best to put it in a vehicle cup holder and possibly a camping chair's cup holder too.  My 19 yr old son asked to use it-he was impressed with how much coffee it can hold.,5 out of 5 stars review
7/19/2023,"The cup itself is beautiful %26 BIG! I can fill it up with ice %26 water at night %26 it's still cold in the morning. The lid is a twist on which, to me, is great. I have a 2 year old who likes to get ahold of my cups %26 she has spilt my cups that have the lids that just pop on. My only issue was the delivery. It was literally just the cup in a mail plastic bag. I'm surprised it wasn't dented or scratched up. It got here in perfect shape.",5 out of 5 stars review
9/29/2023,"This cup is pretty amazing. As good as the expensive brand name cup. It will keep ice for 24 hours. I haven't tried using it for hot liquids yet. I love that it fits in the cupholder in my car, I chose the rose gold color, it's more of a pinkish lavender color I don't really see any gold, but it's a pleasant color. I love that it has a unique finish, hard to explain, and it doesn't sweat. This is the best cup I have ever used the handle is so convenient, I'll never buy any other cup.",5 out of 5 stars review

6/30/2023,"The fact that this fits perfectly in every cup holder I've used it in is why I now own multiples of these cups. The handles are comfortable to carry, they keep your ice from melting quickly which in the summer heat of the south is a necessity.",5 out of 5 stars review
9/30/2023,I keep seeing people with the Stanley brand everywhere I turn but I'm not spending that kind of money on a cup. I was excited to see these for $19.99 at Wally World. Keeps my drink cold. Comes with a nice straw and the pink is absolutely beautiful.,5 out of 5 stars review

3/4/2023,This is my favorite mug! The base is tapered to fit in the cup holders of my car and there is absolutely plenty of room for all of my ice and filtered water. My favorite aspect of this is the little rubber edition/extension of the straw. He gives extra reach plus a very pleasant rubbery feeling versus the stiff plastic for my straw use.,5 out of 5 stars review
3/5/2023,"This tumbler is just lovely.  
The colors make me so happy. There is peach, pastel yellow bubly pink and Caribbean blue.  I swear it makes me want to drink more water. 
It keeps cold water very well, I was able to sip for hours and not worry about it getting warm. This will work very well during summer. I also tested hot tea and found that I had to open the cover to get it warm enough to drink. Speaking of which I love that I can see through the top. 
The size also makes it easy for getting in my daily hydration needs. Also the bottom part is slimmer so it can fit in most cup holders making it easy to travel with. 
This tumbler is a plus for me and I highly recommend it.",5 out of 5 stars review
3/2/2023,"The Ozark Trail 40 ounce insulated stainless steel tumbler is such an amazing cup for such a great value!  I fill it up in the morning and still have ice left in it in late afternoon. I don't drink hot beverages but I assume it would have the same success in keeping a hot drink warm.  It holds a good amount of liquid so I'm sure to get my daily water in.  I love the handle, straw (straws just make me drink more water!) and the lavender color as well.  I was honestly shocked when I saw the price point on this one.  One of its primary competitors is 3-4x the price of this one but the Ozark Trail one is every bit as good!  Highly recommend!

I like the matte silicone feel of it, which is unique & makes it easier to grip.  The handle is a sturdy plastic & has finger grooves to hold it comfortably.  It also has the Ozark Trail emblem embossed on it which is cool.  I like that the lid on this twists on which keeps the lid on in case it tips over.  However it is hard getting it twisted on so that the spout lines up to my mouth.  The insulation keeps my water cold & ice frozen for hours.  The straw is a nice feature.  It's made of rubber & the top portion of it is made of a flexible silicone material.  So I don't have to tilt the tumbler to drink...",5 out of 5 stars review
3/25/2023,Great size. Insulated and still fits in car drink holder. Very easy to clean. I loved the clear view lid so I can easily see the remaining water level. The straw is silicone which I prefer.

3/9/2023,"The first major benefit of this oversized 40 oz tumbler is that it fits perfectly in my car cup holder. This is a huge design win in my opinion. There are many high volume tumblers that do no fit in the car cup holder. The handle is thick and molds great in my hand. To hold this tumbler, just feels comfortable and not awkward in any way. This is an amazing design. The straw stands up high above the rim of the tumbler. This is another great design. Other tumblers the straw will be maybe 1 inch, at the highest above the tumbler rim. This straw stands nearly 3 inches above the tumbler rim. There is no need for bending to drink from the tumbler.

3/11/2023,"I received the Ozark Trail 40-ounce Stainless Steel Tumbler with Handle & Lid in White. Item #803-389-151. 
This is the kind of Big Gulp cup I can get behind! It's a really nice looking cup. Even without the lid, my drink felt colder longer than usual. Upon delivery, I did notice a dent on the bottom of the cup on the outer wall layer. I did not see any damage to the inner layer wall so fingers crossed, it'll holdup for a long time. 
The cup has a nice soft silicone? texture and the handle is solid plastic that is screwed on. While the lid has a rubber gasket to help create a seal, this lid is not spill proof. When using without the straw, you can rotate a plastic piece over the spout but it does not prevent leaks. Maybe to prevent bugs and...",5 out of 5 stars review

It has performed well in keeping whatever I put in it cold.  And the fact that it does not sweat is one thing that makes me love it.  Nothing is worse than packing up a drink and having it drip all over you and leave a ugly ring on the table.  This is my first tumbler with a handle.  I like it as the tumbler itself is big around and the coating makes it slick.  It would be easily dropped so the handle is a great idea.  This tumbler holds 40 ounces, 5 cups.

3/3/2023,"I have been using Ozark Trail 40 oz Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel Tumbler and have been really pleased with it. The vacuum insulation keeps my drinks hot or cold for hours, making it perfect for long road trips or outdoor activities. The clear plastic lid with sliding closure is easy to drink from and the silicone gasket prevents leaks. However, due to its size, it's a bit too large to fit in standard cup holders and can be a challenge carrying around. Overall, I'm very satisfied with my usage of it and would recommend it to others looking for a durable and insulated tumbler.",5 out of 5 stars review
3/16/2023,"I really love this cup. The design is very hot trending right now and it looks much better in person. The cup is lightweight, not too heavy even when I add water to full cup.

I can tell it's worth every penny.",5 out of 5 stars review
3/27/2023,Love this cup! Only complaint is the screw top lid- if you prefer the straw to align on a certain side due to handle preference you may need to try screwing the lid on a few times to get it just right. It would be better if the lid was a push on with the gasket or just move the straw hole to the middle of the lid.,5 out of 5 stars review

3/4/2023,There's really not much to say besides amazing. I love how big the cup is and how functional it is. I use it practically every day whether it's helping me keep up with my daily water intake or drinking my morning coffee. I highly recommend this product,5 out of 5 stars review

It also has a handle for carrying.  I love the design of the straw--firm on the part that goes into the bottle and flexible on the top.  It's thicker in the middle so it fits securely in the bottle with no leaking at all.  The bottle is tapered at the bottom so it t sits in the car cup holder between the seats.  Very convenient.  Great bottle for making sure you get your water needs taken care of every day!",5 out of 5 stars review
3/6/2023,I truly like this cup. It is just as big as the brand that everyone raves about. I actually like this brand better because it does not leak when i turn it upside down.

3/5/2023,"This review is for the Ozark Trail 40 oz. tumbler.  It has a handle so it's easy to hold onto. This is way bigger than your average drink tumbler, it is huge and holds 40 oz. of your favorite beverage.  It comes with a straw as well to make it even easier to drink from.

I like the blue color that it's made from and the inside has a metal surface to keep your drink either very cold or very hot.  Did I mention it holds 40oz. of your favorite drink?  Consider that the average drink is about 12oz., this will hold three cans or bottles of your favorite drink.

I would recommend this tumbler to anyone who wants a tumbler that holds a lot of their favorite drink.",5 out of 5 stars review
3/19/2023,"This stainless steel tumbler is fantastic. It is absolutely huge, as you can see compared to a red solo cup. It's great to take on the beach or to the park for the day. It really helps me drink a lot more water than I normally would have. It's super easy to clean although there are several crevices you have to scrub in the lid. I love the colors and I'm happy that it still fits into my cup holder because the bottom part is a regular cup size. I haven't tried any hot items, normally I only drink ice water.",5 out of 5 stars review
4/28/2023,"Why spend $45   on a tumbler when you can spend $15 that does the exact same thing!!   I did spend $30 because I bought two of them. One for home and one for work, best decision ever.  With all of the water enhancers out there, I'm drinking 100 oz of water before noon everyday.  Meeting my water goals has never been easier.",5 out of 5 stars review
3/5/2023,This stainless steel tumbler makes it easy to get my daily water.  I like that it is small on the bottom so that it fits into a car cup holder.  The lid screws on and off easily and the straw comes a part and cleans easily.  The lid rotates and you can drink without a straw.  It keeps my water cool and I like that I don't have to refill it as often.,5 out of 5 stars review
3/14/2023,"The number one thing you have to know about this cup is that it's REALLY big.  I mean seriously, check out the picture of it in my hand. The lid screws on, which I like because it doesn't leak, but the straw is the really cool part - the part that goes in the cup is a regular plastic straw, but the part sticking out of the cup is the rubbery kind, which is very handy because it's tall, and you might not want to get it completely underneath your mouth so you can drink and you don't have to because the straw bends! Plus, look at the ombre!",5 out of 5 stars review
3/4/2023,"I got this cup for my son but it became a family favorite. The size was larger than I thought which was great for filling it with ice and some flavored water and having it at my desk, in the car for school pickups, trips, etc!!! It's easy to clean, keeps your drinks the perfect temp and looks great!!",5 out of 5 stars review
3/11/2023,"I love that the bottom of this cup is small enough so it fits into cupholders perfectly. I ran this through the dishwasher and it was fine.

5/17/2023,"Love the sleek and comfort of this tumbler! Extremely comparable to the Stanley quencher except it is not as heavy and I actually like the straw design better (half silicone/half plastic).

3/14/2023,"I can‚Äôt start my day without a hot cup of coffee. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so grateful to have this Ozark tumbler with a handle and straw! This 40-ounce stainless steel tumbler is double wall vacuum insulated, so it keeps my coffee hot and the exterior remains sweat-free and comfortable to the touch. Plus, I can take it with me in the car, since it fits in most cup holders.

My husband calls it the King of Tumblers because of its super-capacity size. He took it to work during a snow day and it kept his coffee nice and hot for several hours. Having 40 ounces of liquid means that I can fill up once and not have to worry about refilling until much later in the day. I love it for hot beverages like coffee, iced tea, and hot cider, but it also works great...",5 out of 5 stars review
3/6/2023,"My husband and I both enjoy using this tumbler, and for different reasons. I like it mostly because it can hold and keep a large amount of water and ice cold for a long period of time. My husband enjoys the tumbler for his morning-turned-all-day coffee. He's a lefty, and loves how the handle is on the left side when the mouth spout option is open. I mostly use the straw option. There are two features of this tumbler that are of utmost importance to me: it doesn't sweat onto the surfaces it's set on, and it fits in my minivan's standard size cup holder. Overall, I think this is a good quality option for hot and/or cold drinks!",5 out of 5 stars review
3/8/2023,"Wow, this tumbler is even better than it looked online. It holds an incredible amount of liquid- an incredible 40 ounces! The adjustable top can be closed, ope, or even open for a straw. The coating is a smooth, soft lavender with matching sturdy handle. The inside is is double-walled insulation that keeps hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold without sweating. This tumbler can be  washed in the top rack of your dishwasher if you ever need to sanitize it. 
I can't wait to embellish it with a couple of stickers.",5 out of 5 stars review
3/7/2023,"Let me start this out by saying this is a huge cup! The colors are vibrant, and you can tell this is well made. 
The insulation kept my drink cold, filled about halfway with ice, for almost a full 24 hours.  
My only possible concern would be that there are screws holding the handle to the cup..which could possibly rust over time or become loose.

This is my new go to cup, I can stay hydrated or stay caffeinated. I also like that it comes with a straw that has a silicone end so I don‚Äôt hurt my teeth. I would definitely recommend this.",5 out of 5 stars review

Cleaning the tumbler is easy and it is top rack dishwasher safe. I love the colors of the tumbler and how they fade into each other. The size of this tumbler is excellent for long trips or long days out when you need a lot of refreshment.",5 out of 5 stars review
3/4/2023,"I have many tumbler cups in high and low priced brands and so far I've been very happy with this one. It's quite large and I needed a large cup because my kids are constantly drinking from mine. It does get heavy when full but worth it. The colors beautiful and I only hand wash it. I love the versatility of the cup from straw to sip and it even twists to accommodate each setting or to close. Overall, it's a great cup and has kept my drink cool for long periods. I would recommend this to others!",5 out of 5 stars review
3/6/2023,"I love, love, love this cup!

 It's huge (actually holds the full 40oz), the straw is the perfect length (with a silicone end attached), the lid can be adjusted to be used without the straw (turn up to drink), and it keeps the temp of the beverages inside. 
The colors are definitely an added bonus. 
It fits into my vehicles' cupholders. 
I love the easy hold/carry handle.
It's all dishwasher safe as well. 

Only small con: I do wish that there was a way to enclose the straw or cap the straw, for sanitary reasons.",5 out of 5 stars review
3/9/2023,"The Ozark Trail 40 oz Vacuum Insulated Stainless steel Tumbler in Blue in one of my new favorites because of its large size! I am notorious for not getting my daily water in and I love using this tumbler to help me reach my daily goal. I fill the tumbler in the morning and then again after lunch to make sure that I get at least 80 ounces in. The water stays cold each time I fill it. The tumbler is well made and durable with a large easy to hold handle. The twist on lid can be used with the included rubber tipped straw or you can twist the straw holder over for a wider opening. This tumbler is dishwasher safe, BPA free and comes with a lifetime warranty. I highly recommend!",5 out of 5 stars review
3/7/2023,I work a very physically demanding job and it is important I stay hydrated. I unload semis and I had a cup I was using but I'd have to step away usually twice to fill my bottle back up with water during each unload. This one holds way more than the one I was using which makes me have to step away from unloading so much. Which helps me get dont quicker. It is a very sturdy and well made cup. I've dropped it and had my heart sink but thankfully it did not break. I love that it has a handle too. The straw I like has silicone on the tip of it making it more comfortable to drink out of. This has kept my ice water cold for well over 24 hours. I've left it at work or in the car and when I get back to it my water will still be cold!,5 out of 5 stars review
3/20/2023,"The 40-ounce capacity of this reusable tumbler is fantastic for those who want to stay hydrated throughout the day without having to do  frequent refills.
It features a double wall insulation which is great for keeping the Beverage at the required temperature for a long time. It means that I can enjoy my drinks at the temperature I prefer without having to rush to finish them. It can contain both hot and cold drinks 
I really love the large handle which provides a firm grip and prevents the tumbler from slipping out of my hand. I also love that the straw can bend in multiple direction.
While this tumbler has many impressive features, it may not be the best choice for everyone due to its large size. It can make it challenging to fit into sma...",5 out of 5 stars review
3/2/2023,"I live in Georgia, where it gets hot. I spend hours outside doing lawn work, gardening, and tending to my chickens. I try to maintain my water intakes by drinking at least 6 to 8 cups of water, even more when I am outdoors working up a big sweat. The first thing I love about the Ozark Trails 40 ounce stainless steel tumbler is the size. I am able to get more fluid in this without having to drop what I am doing constantly to refill my cup. This tumbler is insulated so it keeps your hot coffee, cocoa and tea hot as well as keeping ice all day. I literally filled up the cup with ice first thing in the morning and it lasts even out in the hot sun. It comes with a convenient straw for sipping. You can remove the straw as well and it has an openi...",5 out of 5 stars review

3/3/2023,"I love this new Ozark Trail 40oz stainless steel tumbler! Ozark Trail must have listened to people who use these types of tumblers of their desires for a tumbler like this.  I quit using my similar tumblers for several reasons, but one is not having an attached handle. This new Ozark Trail tumbler has a nice big handle built right in which makes grabbing the tumbler so much easier. My other tumblers had a separate handle that slipped on but constantly slipped off. The second reason I quit using the others is because of the push on lid. I was getting to the point that it was a struggle to get the lid off. With the screw on lid of this new design, taking the lid off and on is easier than ever. The flexible end of the straw is such a great ide...",5 out of 5 stars review

It comes with an attached straw that can be disassembled the top part of this straw is a flexible silicone the bottom part is a hard plastic. When you put the cap onto this mug I am right handed what you would do if you would put where the straw would be in the middle of the cup and then twist and it will always go to that side for a right handed person go to the other side where the handle is and that's for a left handed person.

3/1/2023,"This Ozark Trail tumbler is now my favorite drink container. Vacuum insulated for keeping drinks hot or cold for extended periods of time. I don't know for how long because my drinks are usually gone within an hour or less. It comes with its own straw set up; a hard plastic straw connected to a soft flexible straw/tube that seals in the hole of the lid. Great lid too. It screws on, so it won't fall off after a long time of usage, the lid has a movable piece that can be turned to seal the top (not completely leak proof) limiting any amount of spillage if the tumble is knocked over or turned so you can use it without the straw set up. It also has a handle that makes it very easy to hang onto when using. Even with the 40-ounce capacity, the tu...",5 out of 5 stars review
2/26/2023,"Love this lavender 40oz mug from Ozark Trail! First off, it's huge- with a nice, sleek cylinder type stainless steel design, that holds my daily water. It keeps it cold all day, til the next morning. Nice big handle, and you can feel the build quality from its weight. I like that the lid screws on instead of the pop on type, for no mess transporting. Comes with a straw with a bendy rubber top. I highly recommend this cup for anyone, as it isn't just your average thermal mug.",5 out of 5 stars review
2/25/2023,"This Ozark Trail Stainless Steel tumbler is my new favorite water tumbler, I absolutely love it! The size is great, it fits 40 ounces of water so I don't have to refill too often, and the double wall design prevents sweating and keeps my water cold for hours and my coffee stays hot. The large opening allows for easy filling with ice cubes and water. The twist off plastic cap closes securely and is cleverly designed with an opening for the straw, a separate sip opening and you can also twist the top of the cap to close the lid in order to keep your drink fresh and clean. This stainless steel tumbler is awesome to stay hydrated and take anywhere with me, it makes it easy to always have water by my side throughout the day and bedside at night....",5 out of 5 stars review
2/28/2023,I absolutely love this insulated tumbler.  I was looking for one that would keep my water and lemon cold all night on my bedside table as I like to sip through the night and first thing in the morning.  This one certainly fits the bill.  I fill it up around 8PM with ice and water and at 7AM it is still ice cold.  It has a large handle for easy gripping when it is full.  It has a 40 oz capacity which when filled twice per day satisfies my daily water goal.  It even fits in the cup holder in my car.  I love the flexible straw that's easy to clean.  Don't hesitate to get a few of these.,5 out of 5 stars review
3/1/2023,"I'm a drinker. I have to have fluid in front of me all the time and a big meal goes down with a lot of drinking. This thing is enormous and gets refilled way less per day and the cup-holder size base means it lasts between pit-stops on the road too. The stainless steel vacuum sides mean the ice stays ice the whole time too. The straw admittedly took a little getting used to as the top few inches are a soft silicone while the remainder is a standard stiff straw....but as soon as I wrapped my brain around it, I wish they were all this way.",5 out of 5 stars review

2/28/2023,"I love this cup!  It is a stainless steel 40-oz cup that keeps water and ice cold for a long time.  The bottom of the cup is slender and fits into my car‚Äôs cup holder; the handle is large and well attached to the cup.  The lid screws on (instead of popping on/off), the straw has a silicone piece of the end which makes it comfortable to use and allows the straw to reach to the very bottom; the top of the cup lid is very deep and has a couple of ways to drink from it (straw insert/direct drink) and can be sealed shut.  The outside of the cup is not fingerprint proof.  
Overall, I think it is a fantastic cup which I love to carry around and use everyday.  Not only do I highly recommend, but I will buy more of these for my family.",5 out of 5 stars review

The large 40 oz capacity helps me drink more water and saved me money from always grabbing bottles of water. Which has an additional positive component because it means I‚Äôm helping the environment in the process by using less plastic!

The cup is cut at the bottom to fit in a car cup holder.  If you are to use this tumbler in the car a nice feature is the flexible straw. This is a convenient feature that makes it easy to get sips in while holding the cup at a lower incline. In other words, with a standard straw you have to hold the cup up or risk bending/breaking the straw or restricting the flow of liquid due to the straws airflow being restricted. But with the bendable flexi straws the cup can be held l...",5 out of 5 stars review
2/27/2023,Surprisingly I've been debating this cup for awhile but kept putting it off. I finally got this cup in my favorite color and I love it.

I love that it can hold 40oz of liquid and even though I use it for water I have the option to drink hot beverages in it too. 
I really like the handle making it easy to carry around with me around the house or on the go. The lid is screw on which I like as well, gives me extra assurance that the liquids won't drip out while I'm drinking from it.

At 40 ounces, it towers over the rest of my water cups. It is extremely well made, tough and durable, including the straw and the top as well. My favorite things about this tumbler is that it actually fits in my drink holder in my car. I like that it has a handle. I also like that the lid screws on to keep it secure instead of just popping in. I also like that it gives me the option of using the straw, sipping or being able to close it completely.

The outer colored powder coating is nice, the plastic handle is attached and comfortable to grip and the lid is twist on. The cup is designed to fit in your cup holder even though it holds a whopping 40 oz. I have used this cup all day for 4 days in a row and I cannot find anything I do not like about it.  Let's talk about this lid; the lid has a rotating center piece to adjust from straw to regular and then to close. It twists on and stays sealed all day. The included straw is hard plastic and does not come above the lip of the cup but there is a rubber attachment that is removable and washable to drink from. It can be bent while drinking which is nice...",5 out of 5 stars review

3/1/2023,I love the look of this tumbler. First off the colors are absolutely beautiful. Secondly it is powder coated I believe and it is so so so smooth. It kepts my drink with ice for nearly 2 days. Which is perfect in my opinion. I use pebble ice and it kept it mostly frozen. I still has some left T the end of 2 days. I drink normally water with ice and or a mix in.,5 out of 5 stars review

2/9/2024,"I have tried the Stanley 40 oz tumbler and I was not impressed. I love ice cold water and when 90% of my ice was gone in the Stanley, I went back to my Ozark Trail tumbler and it has kicked Stanley's butt in my opinion! I fill my glass with a lot of ice at 6:30 am and then add water - room temp or cold - and I still have a full cup of ice 18 hours later. At about 30 hours, I add more ice but the liquid never warms up!! That is a true success story. 

I have one in purple and wanted another one...one for home and one for when I go to class. LOVE the mint green color and it meets all my expectations and for less than 1/3 the cost of a Stanley. I am very, very, VERY content with my OT cup!!",5 out of 5 stars review

This Ozark Trail 40 oz with handle showed up in my feed and the reviews were great so I headed to Wal Mart to get one. I got the gradient color in peach pink and blue. This is an amazing cup! It cost four times less than the Stanley and works so well! I brought it home and filled it half with ice and then filled it up with water. 24 hours later most of the ice was still there! Summer will be the true test outside but I feel this will stand up well.

The RTIC tumblers are less expensive at $17.99, but shipping, straws, and the handle kit cost a significant amount of money.

Enter the Ozark Trail tumbler, essentially the same as their Stanley counterparts. Maybe even made in the same factory, but I cannot  confirm this right, but they look the same.

The cup keeps my water icy cold, the lid screws on snugly, it fits my van's cupholders, and, I caught mine on sale for $13 each, delivered, because I'm a W  member. Value city, baby!

Our favorite is the HydraFlow and  milk decided to try this one because it was on clearance. it's a nice stainless cup but I don't care that the straw is completely plastic/silicone whereas the HydraFlow cups have a stainless straw with a separate silicone nib.

It's been great to keep her hydrated, and she loves the purple color.  Overall a great cup for the price.",5 out of 5 stars review

1/20/2024,"Absolutely love this product! I've owned it for about two weeks and it works great! I bring it to work with me and it stays cold the entire 10 hour shift! Also love the big handle to put my hand through, it makes it much easier to hold! I haven't tried any hot stuff in it yet but I'm excited to try!",5 out of 5 stars review
1/6/2024,"I bought the Lilac color for a white elephant gift. To say it was envied is an understatement. I ended up buying 4 more. at $15 each (a little less), why would I go spend $30 or more on a stainless steel branded cup that does the exact same thing. Ozark Trail did a fine job making this cup. I enjoy using it and the colors are great too. Thanks for making it more reasonably priced.",5 out of 5 stars review
1/19/2024,This tumbler is great. It holds up. The only issue that I have is the straw that came with it.  It's short and they just added silicone top piece to the straw.  I will have to buy straws that will fit the length of this tumbler but other than that it's great. Love the color as well!,5 out of 5 stars review
1/4/2024,I absolutely love this Tumblr it keeps my drinks ice cold and when I have ice in one of my drinks it takes really really long for the ice to melt at all the only complaint I have about it is that it is pretty large which makes it hard to accommodate in like cup holders in a car or anything like that,5 out of 5 stars review
1/21/2024,"this tumbler is the same size as a Stanley and keeps ice for hours. I am a teacher and dont always get to drink my water before the ice melts, this is my solution. I do need to have my drink cold when I refill it so that it doesnt melt the ice (again as a teacher I dont have ready access to more ice) but that is with any cup/tumbler.",5 out of 5 stars review
1/8/2024,"It did exactly what I wanted it to do. It now fits in the cupholder in the car. I knew that was going to be true when I saw it. However, it now allows it space to have another cup in the holder right next to it.

Took me a day to get used to the different shape. I also had to create a different space in the fridge. Any negative, and I can't think of one, is out wage by allowing 2 cups in the car's cup holder. .

I have not previously used a screw top lid. For the first few days I removed the straw to take the lid off or on. I was tickled pink when I discovered that I could get the straw where I wanted by starting it on the opposite side of where I wanted to drink . I felt that was really cool!",5 out of 5 stars review
