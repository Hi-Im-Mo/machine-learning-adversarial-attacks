2/12/2024,Disappointed. I ordered this online because my store was out of this color. Very disappointed t receive this and see the handle is a much lighter shade than the tumbler. I'll still use it but not happy with the color difference,1 out of 5 stars review
12/5/2023,"Given the increasing cost of everyday items such as groceries, you can imagine how frustrated I am to once again receive expired food in my pickup order. The food expired a full month ago. Not only is that a waste of my money, it is also unsafe given that it is dairy. Almost one full month. I placed my order on December 4, 2023 and received cottage cheese that is stamped “best by November 6, 2023”.",1 out of 5 stars review
9/3/2023,"DAMAGED. Supposed to have a handle. It is not there-broken off. If it won't hold up to shipping it won't hold up to the amount of use I will give it. I ordered a lavender 40 oz tumbler because I drink A LOT of water and need something to hold a lot of water in my van AND be easy to handle. I thought WITH a handle this would be ideal. But seeing the poor design of how the handle would have attached, I don't think so. 
AND thought the color would be more like the Ozark 20 oz tumbler I have. I like it but it is not large enough. But without a handle it would be tough to use a 40 oz tumbler while driving.",1 out of 5 stars review

12/22/2023,I'm upset that I can't use my tumbler because wrong straw sent with it. It wouldn't be so bad if I had an extra taller straw at home to use. Other than that the cup is beautiful!,1 out of 5 stars review
10/22/2023,What idiot came up with this design???  A SCREW IN LID???  A lid that does NOT line up for easy drinking???  It lines up just off the handle which is quite possibly the most clumsy position for the straw!!!,1 out of 5 stars review

1/11/2024,"So it says it's 40oz but it only holds 1 20oz water bottle and less than half of another water bottle. So I would like 26 oz maybe.  If I could return it, I would.  Also, it doesn't keep my water cold, ice melts fairly quickly.",1 out of 5 stars review

8/7/2023,I purchased 3 of these cups mid April back when they were $15. 3 mth later These cups no longer keep drinks cold at all. The ice melts within hr or so. I'm not sure I shld be disappointed seeing I only paid $15 but every penny counts now days. I was a big fan of ozark cups %26 they were my go to when the yeti came out but I will just have to spend the extra $20 %26 purchase the name brand. Happy I wanted to do a review so I cld give a honest feedback.,1 out of 5 stars review
3/30/2023,"Terrible at keeping ice! The only thing this cup has going for it is the appearance (at least the rainbow cup). I’ve been wanting an affordable tumbler that is stainless steel and can fit in my cup holder in my truck. I saw this on someone’s Instagram and picked up three of these cups. I put ice to the TOP and add cold water, the ice is melted only a few hours later. Don’t waste your money on these like I did, I am returning the other 2 cups that still have tags and will use that money for a more expensive brand that can actually keep drinks cold.",1 out of 5 stars review
8/19/2023,"Poorly made, I bought two and the handle came off of both of them with minimal use, one while holding it.

4/10/2023,"I really wanted to like this. Not only did walmart mess up my order multiple times causing me to have to cancel and reorder TWICE, but when it finally did arrive the bottom had such big dents that it wouldn't even stand up on it's own. I carried it around from 6pm to 11pm ONE day and the color is already worn off on every edge and groove. It's like the color coat is chalky and just rubs off with barely and friction.

4/6/2023,"After reading reviews I thought we’d give this Ozark tumbler a try for our 11yo daughter. After washing it and filling with ice/water, I started screwing on the lid while holding what appeared to be a sturdy handle. It loosened up right away and then fell completely off side of cup. Super disappointing bc the rest of tumbler looks great. Ozark def needs to figure out a better way to attaching the handle to the cup especially for how large the cup is. Do t waste your time just go with a Stanley or Yeti and skip the hassle.",1 out of 5 stars review

As the days went by, Lis became impossible to get off, handle is half falling off and NOW the lid is completely stuck on. I am a very fit person, so is my husband, neither of us can get the lid of. Total waste, now I have to buy a new Tumbler. Should have just spent the $45 on a quality mug instead of the Walmart rip off.",1 out of 5 stars review
10/9/2023,"I was loving this. It keeps things cold just as well as my Yeti and the screw on top is easy. Since it's 40 ounces, I can take it in the car and have cold water all day.

Unfortunately, in under two months of use, I just picked it up and the handle snapped off….leaving me with the handle in my hand and my tumbler rolling around on the floor.
It's too big for me to carry without a handle, so it's useless now.",1 out of 5 stars review
7/22/2023,I loved this cup at first. Less expensive than the Stanley cup but it's definitely not the same quality. The handle on my cup broke off while I was twisting off the lid. The cup is useless now. I don't have the receipt or the label so I can't return it.,1 out of 5 stars review

9/19/2023,I've had other Ozark Trail tumblers and this one does not hold up to those! This one doesn't hold ice like the others I have and once the ice is melted my water stay cold much longer.,1 out of 5 stars review
8/16/2023,The tumbler is very nice and holds ice all day.  My only complaint is the straw.  It is soft and feels funny when I use it.  I've tried to find a replacement but none of them fit and seals completely.,1 out of 5 stars review

7/18/2023,Paid cash. Tossed receipt. Got home and found that someone at the store had dropped it. Small dent in the bottom but enough that it wobbles badly. Very fragile. Not what i would call durable.,1 out of 5 stars review
9/26/2023,I only used it for water and found a scratch inside the cup. Got a refund and ordered another purple one. It had the same scratch inside it. Returned it as well. So the scratch is from the manufacturing process. Sad because I really liked it.,1 out of 5 stars review
7/28/2023,Overpriced $20 is too much $15 is the right price for this especially with the handle that always breaks. Inflation is supposedly going down but this went up….,1 out of 5 stars review
4/24/2023,I was really looking forward to this cup.  Figured it would be a cheap alternative to the $50 Stanley ones.   I do find the handle to be sturdy and makes it easy to carry around.   First negative is the tumbler already has a scratch on it and I've only used it 2-4 times and handwash it only.   Biggest thing I am disappointed with is it doesn't hold the ice for that long.   I had a 32 oz ozark trail and it would literally keep ice in it and cold til next day.   This one melts in a few hours.   So although it did save me money initially.  Wish I wouldn't have got it!,1 out of 5 stars review
