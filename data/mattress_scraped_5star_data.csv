3/19/2023,"This is a great mattress for the price! Honestly, very impressed! It came in a large box, 40”tall x 15”x 15”, heavy but not too heavy (I'm not that crazy strong of a female and I managed). The mattress comes rolled up crazy tight, so when you CAREFULLY cut it open, you can hear the air escaping and watch the mattress “air up”. It's actually pretty cool to watch, my son got a kick out of it. When first seeing and pushing on the mattress once it was laid out, I was a bit worried it wouldn't be soft enough. So we sat the mattress up against the wall for a couple days, longer than the recommended time, and by then it was fluffed and ready to be slept on comfortably. You could definitely see the quilted top by then. Probably would've been fine a...",5 out of 5 stars review
11/14/2023,"I love this mattress it's outstanding it came packaged well I mean it's easy to follow instructions. All you have to do is just cut off the plastic and let it air out and oh my God, you talk about the best night sleep or nap ever I love this mattress this is great . It's worth your money.",5 out of 5 stars review
5/14/2013,"The bed is really easy to move around since it is compacted into such a small box. It inflated very quickly. As soon as I took it out of the box and unrolled it, it immediately started expanding to its original size. The bed is very comfortable and there is no weird smell or anything like that. It's an excellent purchase considering how inexpensive the bed is. I'm extremely satisfied with the bed. ""Bed in a box"" sounded pretty sketchy to me but its totally fine after you take it out and let it expand.",5 out of 5 stars review
8/27/2016,"This mattress is very comfortable and soft. Purchased for our daughter's off campus apartment. The mattress is shipped rolled up, but expands once the plastic is removed. I would definitely purchase this brand again, as well as recommend it. Believe the ratings, because not only are they accurate, they played a big part in my purchase. Don'the forget to purchase the bundled frame.",5 out of 5 stars review

7/21/2021,"super dooper amazing find! I read reviews , look at pics, and sometimes go against what others wrote and try it myself.  But I had my eye on this mattress for a while . I decided to purchase a trundle bed Full size top and twin bottom so I said let me buy it. I bought it when the shipping was free!! anyways,  It came in a tall box and it has some weight 40-50lbs . I slowly unraveled it and read the directions.  it comes with specific directions so you must read..so I opened with caution because it is zipped airtight...it slowly unrolled on my flat carpet on top of the plastic it came in. and Walaaa....it was 8"" within 4 minutes.

12/15/2016,This was purchased for a 3-year old's first ' big girl' bed!! Could not believe this mattress could be rolled into a box!! When unwrapped it began to 'inflate' and soon was nearly to size. Directions say it takes 48 hours. Anyhow her mommy kind of took it over and raves over the comfort!!! Mommy was evicted!!!,5 out of 5 stars review
2/6/2012,"I have a day bed frame and was looking for comfortable mattresses to use on them. I read the reviews and was impressed. It is true these mattresses are so comfortable. My day bed has a pop-up trundle bed that folds under it. The mattresses were bought for my guest room so that I can use it as a studio couch in my office on a daily basis and when I have guests it opens into a king sized bed. I had to test them out to make sure they were good enough for my guest, and they are. I slept like a baby.
Thanks Walmart

9/23/2023,Some of the other reviews weren't great so I was kinda nervous but I have no complaints so far for this mattress. Didn't take long at all to inflate (I did not wait the recommended 48 hours before sleeping on it) haven't measured it but seems it's reached the height it's supposed to be. (8inches) definitely comfortable and soft. I would buy again.,5 out of 5 stars review
3/30/2017,Great Option. I bought this online and was a little thrown off as it arrived in a little box and thought they had shipped the wrong thing. When I opened the box it was vaccumed sealed to 1 inch flat and rolled up like a barrito. I thought there is no way that's a whole mattress. But once the seal was broke it popped open to full size like a river raft it was actually pretty cool. The mattress felt really good firm but soft I was very impressed and may by another one for another bedroom.,5 out of 5 stars review
8/16/2023,Great quality and affordable price. I bough this for my son's room. I find it a little firmer than expected (and than I like) but he has had no issue sleeping on it.

5/28/2014,"I purchased the platform South Shore Queen Bed with the two drawers underneath, and then this mattress for my finished basement/my bedroom. It looks great with the hardwood floors and the price was perfect for just the look I wanted. The Matress is very comfortable and don't need to add any memory foam at all.

6/3/2014,"I suffer from fibromyalgia which often leaves me in a great deal of pain. In the past I have purchased more expensive mattresses to find them in worse condition as well as providing no relief. In the past I purchased the twin size mattress which we still have and instantly fell in love. The softness and the comfort is AMAZING! Especially for the price you can't beat it! Now, if your expecting to get a $10,000 mattress for this price or top of the line try else where this is NOT the mattress for you but if your expecting to get a fairly decent mattress that is comfortable for a great price than look no further!

I got this mattress because it was cheap Usually I read reviews but when I saw the price I was excited.. and it wasnt until after I ordered it that I looked at the reviews. I got to admit I was kind of worried because people are saying it kind of doesnt last long. But honestly if you know how to take care of things I think this will be fine. Its soft and I cant feel the springs inside of it, and the inflating was exciting. Im gonna get a Bed frame next week. But this is wonderful honestly. Its my first time buying a mattress and Im 18. I honestly don't care if its not meant to last, I need this for now, and Ill buy supports and stuff. But I like it.",5 out of 5 stars review

4/17/2020,l was skeptical about purchasing a mattress in a box but i took a chance. When they delivered the box it was in terrible shape the tape on the box was lose and the top was wide open.

It is an EXTREMELY AMAZING mattress for the price; I am literally blown away. I would be curious to try Zinus top of the line. The guys have quite a sense of humor, they are extremely sweet. They will help you and make recommendations depending on what you feel is missing to make your bed perfect. With this mattress, I feel like a topper will make it perfect. I like that theres not too much crap around the edges: it allows you to customize it and make it fit wherever you want.

1/29/2017,"Even though I read many reviews about this mattress, I was still a bit skeptical about a mattress in a box.  However, we needed to replace a sofa couch with a bed, and this looked like an economical  way to do so.  The mattress and foundation were delivered exactly as planned, and the wonderful Fedex driver wheeled them right in to our bedroom, even giving our dog a treat.  I am 82, and my husband is 85,  so this was important to us.  We thought we might need help to get it set up, but we had it done in fifteen minutes.  The instructions were explicit and we needed no tools to set it up.  The mattress is beautiful, comfortable, and a real bed, when combined with the foundation.  We are more than pleased.",5 out of 5 stars review

Couldn't be more thrilled that we paid $150 for a decent new mattress. It's surprising how it inflates IMMEDIATELY after you take it out of the box and wrapping.

This mattress is so comfortable that every position I lay in is perfect. I slept like a baby... I wanted to suck my thumb(lol jk)  Before getting out of bed I ordered myself the same mattress in queen size for my room. I havent returned to my bed and won...",5 out of 5 stars review
9/12/2016,I received this bed in a moderately big package. (I'm 140lbs) Very easy to move by myself into my bedroom. It was easy to unpackage and inflated in a matter of seconds. The instructions stated to wait 48 hours to enjoy the beds full potential but I only waited 8 hours haha yet it was surprisingly super soft. I felt no springs while laying down and I've had it now for almost a week. I love it!!! Definitely a great purchase!! (I order the full sized bed by the way),5 out of 5 stars review
2/26/2017,"I was skeptical but thought I would give this mattress a try since I didn't have the time to physically shop sales only to be told the great deal was not available and I should spend more on another model. This was so easy! The box showed up at my back door and I was able to maneuver it inside and into a room that had a lot of floor space! And, I'm 63 years old with a bad back! I was so happy with it that I bought another one for my guest room. I have been enjoying this mattress for a year and still love going to bed at night.",5 out of 5 stars review
5/20/2016,"I was a tad disappointed when I first opened it because I could feel the coils and thought the top padding wasn't thick enough. Less than 1/2 later I came back and touched the mattress again, this time I couldn't feel the coil and the top padding is fluffed up and feels much better.  The firmness of the mattress is perfect for me. Will be buying a second one for my other bedroom.",5 out of 5 stars review
8/12/2011,"I bought this mattress for my guest room. I put it on the bed frame (from walmart) no box spring needed. It was heavy.

It's very nice and you'd never know it came in a box. My boyfriend and I slept on it a couple nights ago and its very comfy . I think anyone would be happy with it.",5 out of 5 stars review

1/15/2024,"I would say if you're gonna get this mattress on an upholstered bed frame, make sure you either already have a box spring or get one. With a box spring too, the mattress just becomes so much more comfortable. My dad and I were honestly so shocked when it came rolled up and vacuum sealed. But all we had to do was cut the seal open and let it air out so the mattress could ya know, be more of a mattress lol. But now I'm in love with it. Compared to my old mattress that was so much thicker, this helps my back so so much and it's money well spent. My cats love my new bed as they sleep with me, and everyone that has laid on it loves it as well.",5 out of 5 stars review
1/9/2024,I ordered a full size mattress. It came well packaged. I was able to get it upstairs and onto the bed frame. A quick snip to open the plastic and poof…..there it was!

12/5/2023,"My mother spent $400 plus on a mattress from Macy's, which then had to be returned for a different one. The second one still didn't work. The main problem was that the mattresses from Macy's had a huge pillow tops which made the bed rounded on the top, super tall and they seemed easy to roll out of! This is a straightforward mattress it's flat on the top, and very comfortable. There are no springs or other things poking out (like I did experience with another less expensive mattress..)
Don't buy this if you want a really tall mattress, but if you want a comfortable, low mattress - which is firm - this one is perfect!",5 out of 5 stars review

11/10/2023,"Very happy with this purchase. It's really hard to find mattresses at a low cost that aren't memory foam which I feel a lot of people don't find that comfy.. this is definitely not the same quality as a $1000 mattress but for a guest room to a bed that won't get regular nightly use out it, it's pretty great quality. Throw a mattress topper on top for some extra coziness and I think it's will be a big hit with guests",5 out of 5 stars review
11/12/2023,"Was really surprized with the Zinus Quilted 8"" mattress. Needed a mattress fast at a bargain price. I figured at this price if it lasted a year would be happy. My son who has back problems was skeptical when it arrived in a box, but is very happy with it and how comfortable it is. It inflated amazingly quick. He slept on it 24 hours later without as much pain. It appears to be of good quality and he says he sleeps better than on my $800. brand name mattress.  There wasn't any odor to it. Would definitely recommend this mattress.",5 out of 5 stars review
11/17/2023,"I bought this on sale - and it is a fabulous value.  I like a firm mattress - better for my back - and this one is firm.  I did add a foam topper for comfort.  When it arrived it opened up very quickly and I was able to sleep on it the same night.  I did not notice any smell, but I opened it in a well ventilated room anyway.  
I would agree that the edges are soft - I think that is the construction.  There is not metal or wire in the edges like in a traditional mattress.  But I don't sit on the edge of the bed, so I don't care.  It does not affect sleeping on it in anyway.  
As for size - I bought a full and it fills out full sheets very nicely. So I don't see that it is any smaller than a traditional full size mattress. I put it on a frame...",5 out of 5 stars review

I WONDERED IF IT WOULD BE AS SOFT AS SOME SPONGY FOAM WITH NO SUPPORT. I CUT THE SEALED BAG AND THE AIR RUSHED IN AND IT EXPLODED INTO A REAL BED.

2/25/2017,"When the mattress was delivered, I have to admit that I was so upset looking at the unopened box. When I opened the box, I was amazed at how the mattress was able to be literally shrink wrapped into a flat square. it was flattened to about 1.5 inches.  Once I cut the shrink wrap off, the mattress rose to the occasion!  When I placed the mattress on the bed and laid on it... WOW!  This is a great mattress, very comfortable for any kind of sleeper in my opinion.  As well as this mattress sleeps, I would have expected the price to be more.

It stays put on the frame, and is the most comfortable mattress we have found, at any price. It is both supportive and sink-in soft because of the pocket-coil construction with the foam layered on top of it.

VERY impressed with this mattress, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a decently priced, comfortable bed.",5 out of 5 stars review

Do not underestimate the size of this box....it is heavy and I had a job getting it up to the second floor.

When you roll over, no movement of the mattress. Amazing pillow-top cushion that is soft but supportive at the same time. I would recommend this mattress to anyone.

My primary concern was whether the mattress would be firm and supportive enough. Another concern I had was wanting a product that had no obvious manufacturing smell.  I bought a futon once (not from Walmart) that had a terrible chemical smell, and I eventually discarded it.  One main reason I wanted a mattress in a box was so that I could bring it home myself and carry it into the bedroom myself.  Local stores charge 25.00 just for delivering a mattress.

We let the mattress unfold and reach its proper shape and size as instructed by NOT sleeping on it for 48hrs (2days)- we bought a twin size.  So far, the mattress meets all our expectation; 8"" (true to size), firm yet very comfortable, color and look exactly as pictured.  I would buy the same mattress in another size when/if we need another one.",5 out of 5 stars review
10/26/2010,"My boyfriend and I looveee our matress. We were a little unsure about a matress that fits into a box, but we're so happy we took the chance. So comfortable! Although it does seem a tad bit smaller than a standard queen, it manages to fit me, my boyfriend and our dog comfortably. Can barely feel others' movement. Very satisfied!",5 out of 5 stars review
10/14/2014,"This mattress was even better than what I was expecting.
My husband has a really bad back, has a few herniated discs and our old mattress was killing him.
He's been very happy with this mattress, it firm, comfortable and has a 10 year warrenty. Plus, it's a little closer to the ground, which makes getting out of the bed easier.
I would definitely recommend this to a friend and you can NOT beat the price.",5 out of 5 stars review

9/20/2015,"I went several times to Walmart.com and looked at this item, compared with other items and read the reviews. I took quite a while to decide to buy this item as I wasn't in a real hurry for a new mattress. Here is my experience. First, site to store was fast and easy. I received it 2 days earlier than stated. Package was a little heavy but really not hard to handle. Fit into the back of my explorer easily. It can fit into the backseat of a car easily, unless you drive a compact. The instructions are on the flap when you open the box from the proper end and inside taped to the package.

10/23/2013,"I'm always weary of buying big ticket items from Walmart because of the stigma that they're not focused on quality. I was looking for a cheap mattress for a child's bed and being a single mom without a truck, when I found out they sold a mattress in a box I was relieved that at least one obstacle was out of the way. After shopping around, I decided to give this mattress a go.

I am so glad I did!!

It was convenient to get home, easy to set up, is very nice to look at (albeit a little cheap-y looking, but nothing sheets won't cover up!) AND it's a pretty solid mattress.

My son has been sleeping on it for about 3 weeks now and every time I sit on it I'm surprised how ""meaty"" the mattress is. It doesn't feel like you could stuff it in a box ...",5 out of 5 stars review

I've tried it myself and it's so nice to not feel any springs in your back or hear any noise from the mattress.

3/20/2017,"When we first got this mattress I thought they'd sent the wrong one bc of the box it came it. But omg I can't say enough good things about this matress. It's so comfy and I don't wake up hurting in my hips anymore and feel well rested when I wake up. I used to wake up like at 11 or 12, but since having this mattress I wake up at 8 or 9 feeling refreshed. It's amazing how much of a difference  there is going from an older worn out mattress to this new one as far as ur body feels. And it's a great price, shipping was faster than expected.

I just bought a queen size for us and I'm happy to report that nothing has changed and if something has, it has only been for the better! My old mattress was from a high end furniture retailer and was like sleeping on a board after the first 3 years, and a spring popped out sideways through the wall of the mattress. This mattress is perfect just the way it is but since my other one was so uncomfortable I bought 1 1/2 inch memory foam and a waterproof mattress topper just to make it bearable.

The deal was great and the bed I ordered said I didn't really need a box spring, so I purchased 2 mattresses to keep for future use. They arrived on time and were on my door step when I arrived home from work. Was very entertaining to see how the mattress opened up; open it on your bed frame, way easier! Kept one in plastic like a box spring. Incredibly soft and comfortable; have had an excellent night's sleep for almost a week and that's after years of insomnia.

5/12/2020,"I needed a twin mattress for my daybed.  Wanted firm.  Tho I could have bought one at a yard sale, I wasn't impressed by the dingy, worn material.
Be prepared to struggle a bit when cutting thru the plastic that it's wrapped in (it's thick and form-fitting).  Also, it wants to straighten out once released.  
It opened to about 4-5"" deep.  Not to worry, it was at the full 8"" by the time I put it on the daybed.  
It fit perfectly.  Such comfort!  
PS. Its firm, not EXTRA firm.",5 out of 5 stars review
7/23/2016,"This mattress is A-Mazing. It comes rolled in a box and almost as flat as a pancake. Once you remove the tape and  wrapping and cut away the plastic ""shrink wrap"" the mattress goes from about 2"" thick to a beautiful 8"" thick. It is soft and firm and oh so comfortable. Watching this mattress expand and become a regular 8"" mattress is really amazing site to see! The comfort is so great!",5 out of 5 stars review

It is firm and very comfortable-I cannot handle soft mattresses. 
Even though I had read about odors this one had none at all. I bought the full size as that is all that I need at this time but if the time comes to get a larger size I definitely will.

1/26/2014,"That is the reason I purchased it on the advice of my chiropractor. I did not want to purchase a whoe new bebroom suite, and was put off by the price of matresses. The fact that this one was vacumn packed and blew up while in the frame was ideal and that feature alone was reason enough to purchase it but the price tag sold me.

This mattress was as comfortable as any I've slept in, and reviews said that for a big woman as myself it would sink to the bottom, but I didnot find this so, and I've had it a few weeks already. Time will tell.

5/1/2011,"I bought a twin size for my guest room. I already had the frame $59 from Walmart, no box spring needed. I had it shipped to my local Walmart (ship to store) for free shipping. The total for the mattress was $200. It came in a box 40"" x 17"" x 17"" and weighed about 45 lbs. It was easy to move it from the cart to the car trunk, no lifting, just some maneuvering, and I had to bungie cord the trunk shut.
I dropped (nothing can break!) the box out of the trunk unto the ground and used a dolly to bring it into the house.
The reason I am telling you all of this is because I had questions whether I could pick it up at the store or pay for shipping to my house. Everything was EASY!!

Within a few hours, I would say it was fully to the correct height. However, I still waited until the next day to fully unwrap it; because I was waiting for a mattress encasement to arrive for it.

We got it home and opened it up to find they compressed and vacuum sealed it, folded it in half and rolled it up. I thought for sure this was gonna be bad. I was wrong. We opened it up and put it on the bed and it is more comfortable then the pillow-top matress on my bed(and I paid more than twice the cost of this one). My daughter loves it and we are very pleased.

My husband who is 70 has difficulty sleeping due to knee pain and would get up many times during the night and either lay on the sofa or recliner, now he goes to the guest bed and stays there all night without getting up until morning.

2/20/2017,"It's a good firm bed. This is the 3rd time I've bought one of these beds; 2 kings and 1 queen. The queen is in our guest room and we haven't had any complaints from our guests, some have even said they've slept better than at home. This is the 2nd one for the king bed in our room, after about 1-1 1/2 years it breaks down and is no longer firm enough for our liking so it had to be replaced. Can't complain about the life span with how cheap they are compared to others. Comes in a decent sized box shrink wrapped and once it's released it 'grows' to whatever size you purchased. We have always let them sit for at least 4 hours to 'grow' before laying on it. No terrible smells or any other issues. It's a simple, firm mattress.",5 out of 5 stars review

I couldn't be happier! I'm amazed at how comfortable this bed is! My mattress is actually a little over 8"" thick and there is wonderful memory foam in there. The top feels like a high quality, firm, but soft to the touch quilt.
Seriously! I tried a sleep number bed at the mall recently worth thousands of dollars and I can't believe this slumber mattress is more comfortable! It's sooo worth every single penny!

9/6/2016,"After sixteen years of marriage and five kids, we decided it was time to upgrade our bed to a king size mattress. We had continually put off this purchase because of the cost of buying a new one. A month or so ago, my sister recommended this mattress from Walmart. When she told us how inexpensive it was compared to most of the mattresses on the market, I was skeptical–but also very interested! In the end, we decided to purchase the mattress because we needed a king bed, we couldn't beat the price, and we figured that worst case scenario it would last a couple of years and then possibly need to be replaced.

3/25/2017,I purchased the mattress a little over a month ago. I mindfully wanted to wait atleast 30 days before I gave my review.

The original delivery date was a Friday and it came on a Tuesday  ( Walmart gave me a gift card on there own accord for the delay.. not bad at all ) Now the mattress comes to life as soon as you set it free...

The cheapest mattress at my local furniture store was 3 times as much as this mattress and it was just a regular spring mattress.

1/31/2017,"First mattress we ever bought in a box.  It arrived as promised.  We opened the box, placed it on the bed and removed the wrapping.  Immediately heard a whooshing....sound while the mattress unfolded and started to raise up.  We bought the twin size for a daybed.  Our Granddaughter sleeps on it and says it is ""wonderful"".  It is crazy how it comes in a box then puffs right up.  Per the instructions, we waited 24 hours to sleep on it although I believe it was ready to go in 1-2 hours.  All the good things we heard about this mattress-in-a-box seem to be true.  Also had the lowest price of all mattresses we researched.",5 out of 5 stars review
5/13/2020,"Comes compressed in a box. Open it/roll it out, and then cut the edges of the compression wrapping and let it expand for 2 days. Once its ready, the bed is comfy and firm.

2/5/2015,"This mattress has the best of both worlds, the body contour ability of all foam, and the firmness of coils. I love my all foam mattress, but my daughters hate it. They have no problem with this one, apparently because the coils give enough support while still providing the benefit of the foam softness and ability to contour, somewhat to the body. Everybody's happy!

12/10/2012,"This is my second one. They are great to sleep on. I had one on my bed and when I moved from FL to MO I sold it with my bedroom set. The friends that bought it say they like it very much. Once settled I ordered another one for my new place. For the comfort and convience you can't beat the price. I use mine every day. There's no way at 63 years young I could handle a full size mattress on my own. I was going for the convience when I bought the first one, but after sleeping on it for 6 months I knew I would have to replace it with the same product when I moved.

3/12/2014,I got one in king size almost 3 years ago & when it came time to get one for my daughter I wanted to get her one so she could sleep in the Spa-Cloud too... That's what we call it. It's not expensive. It won't leave a dent in your wallet. In these economic times budgeting to spend the least & get the best this mattress is a perfect investment. I'm now also getting one for my son who also needs a new mattress. The kids love seeing & hearing it get aired into a mattress filled. My son's Autistic so he had the biggest exitment seeing it fill in. This is definitely something I'd tell all my friends & neighbors. (And I have). You will not regret it.,5 out of 5 stars review

10/4/2016,"I bought this mattress for my 9 year old son. I was a little skeptic because of some of the reviews. When it came it was rolled up in a box. I cut the wrapping off and it inflated in less than a minute. It did make it to 8 inches all the way around right away, I know some were having issues there. Even though it inflated right away we let it sit overnight to be sure there were no issues. There was no smell, which was a huge plus for me as my son is asthmatic. It is however a little stiff and my son said it wasn't very comfortable. He is a tiny guy though so to be fair he wouldn't even weigh down a pillow top. It's been a few weeks and it's gotten softer. I did purchase a thin foam topper and he said it's perfect now. Would recommend this to...",5 out of 5 stars review

Don't be fooled by the size of the box it arrives in or the affordable price...this thing really does spring into a regular shape and sized mattress quickly after opening. First, the shipping was lightning fast and cheap. We ordered the Queen size on Sunday and it arrived Wednesday for only about $3 in shipping!

Secondly, comfort. We have slept like babies on this new mattress for 2 weeks now. We couldn't be happier or recommend this mattress more! We still need to get a box spring for it, as it is just laying on the floor right now but even now it is super comfortable and so spacious. I do think this mattress is probably idea...",5 out of 5 stars review
12/22/2016,"I bought this mattress based on research and reviews of prior buyers.  To be honest, I was also trying to save money. This is a great mattress right out of the box. Took about 4 hours to come to proper size after opening. Easy to unpack also. Slept on mattress that night,  very comfortable, no sagging, no noise. I prefer a firm mattress and found this mattress to be just right!
Also bought frame by Smart Spa to support mattress. Works very well, also very little noise with it as well.
Overall, a very satisfying purchase for both mattress and frame.",5 out of 5 stars review

I bought the platform bed to go with this. Very sturdy and perfect for the room

I paid for delivery to my home which I am glad I did because it is a very heavy item. DElivery was fast but the Fed Ex guy was annoyed because he had to bring it up a couple of flights.

My daughter said she sleeps great on it and it has cushion for her back that seems to give her problems.

7/11/2016,When I first saw these mattresses I wondered how they could be priced so low.  They were rated high by so many people. The bonus for me...2nd day shipping.   That's a rare perk for Hawaii.  So I ordered two! They arrived in exactly two days via FedEx.  The boxes were small.  I would say approximately 3 feet tall and not very heavy. Opening the cardboard box revealed the mattress rolled up in an inner wrap and sealed in plastic.  It was very flat and decompressed.  Once the plastic was removed the mattress inflated to it's normal size in a matter of 1 minute!  Both mattresses are firm and they fit perfectly onto our daybed frame and trundle.  We love them!,5 out of 5 stars review
4/29/2013,This mattress is easily the best investment I have made in a long while. It is absolutely as fine a mattress as those costing several times more. I rate this mattress equal to or better than posturepedic and serta. The firmness is exactly what I wanted and needed. No more back pain in the morning. I awaken refreshed and ready for the day ahead. The look and feel rivals that of the more well known national brands.,5 out of 5 stars review

Yes I was also very hesitant to purchase a mattress in a box BUT I simply followed the directions allowing it at least a day or more to expand WITHOUT sheets, etc.  You'll be amazed to watch it expand.

The mattress did have an odor the first 24 hours that kept me from sleeping on it but, since then, I have been able to sleep through the night. I have had 3 major spinal fusion back surgeries and haven't had a full nights sleep in years, (besides the hot flashes, and we ladies know all about how that disturbs sleep) The first morning, I woke up without pain!

7/25/2013,"Bought a twin for my guest room--rave reviews from all who sleep on it. Fantastic value--and delivered free to my front door! Being able to carry it up two flights of stairs while it was still bound tight and in a box was so much easier than dealing with an open mattress. Wish I had known about this when I bought my own full mattress a few years ago, which cost much more and is not as good a mattress as this new one. I will definitely get the full-sized version of the mattress-in-a-box when the time comes! (And it's so much fun to cut the binding and hear it go ""whoosh!"" as it inflates. Unbelievable how fast it comes to full loft.)",5 out of 5 stars review

After the first night on this mattress, I woke refreshed and my back felt great!
My order was shipped site to store. Because I wasn't sure how big it would be, I took my truck to pick it up. You don't need a truck.

2/27/2017,Because the mattress comes in a box it is easy to manage when moving it around. For me that was getting it upstairs. This is my 2nd mattress in a box. The 1st one I got for my son 2 1/2 years ago and it is still a good mattress. My Tempurpedic was too hard and had to sell it after sleeping on it for 5 years. When my son left for college I tried his bed and my back stopped hurting so I was sold on getting myself a queen size. Love it.,5 out of 5 stars review
10/19/2014,"We ordered this bed online and had it within a week. We followed the directions with regard to opening the packaging and had a good laugh as we listened to it inflate. We put it in place and allowed it to sit for 24 hours before it was slept on. Our adult son was the first to sleep on it and he absolutely loves the firmness of the bed. It's not a fancy mattress, but it certainly fits the bill for us.",5 out of 5 stars review
5/14/2013,"I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical about buying a mattress that has to ""decompress."" I'm a big guy and was afraid that it might ""recompress"" under my weight. But it does not. I have had back pain most of my life. It seems to come and go. But lately I was waking up each morning with lots of back pain. Honestly I should have replaced my old mattress years ago. But I did not realize that it was the cause of my back pain. Since sleeping on this new mattress I wake up with little or no back pain. I really love this mattress and so does my back.",5 out of 5 stars review
