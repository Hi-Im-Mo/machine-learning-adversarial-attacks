9/13/2023,"Good mattress except size is smaller than advertised. 2 inch shorter in length and 2 inch in width. Making it look weird on my king bed.

3/12/2017,"I bought a queen sized mattress in mid 2012 and it was great at first however about 12 months ago it started to sag, I bought a mattress topper to try and increase its longevity but its now sagging too much, I can feel the springs and its hurting my back.  Id use this for a guest room maybe. However Im not too upset for the price I got a good mattress for a couple of years!",3 out of 5 stars review
2/15/2017,"I've had this bed for almost 4 years and for the first 3 it was great, but now it's sinking and there's this a hole in the mattress. I can't sleep at night because the springs are digging into my back. I tried to take some pictures, but I'm not sure you can see since it's a white mattress. :'(",3 out of 5 stars review
9/10/2014,I thought i was getting a good deal i orderd a queen size on roll back for 169.00 on the 5th. it came monday i was excited looking at the mattress it noticed it was a bit small for a queen i measured it. it was a full size sent in a queen box im not happy....i want the right size sent to me or my money back and you can not get it back in the box.. and i dont have a truck... very unhappy looking at the box that is in pieces it says 101lbs and my orders form says 71lbs,3 out of 5 stars review
12/22/2023,Its not really what I was expecting. You can definitely feel the springs a whole lot more than I thought given its a hybrid. I was hoping to not feel the metal when laying on it. The kids wont mind it as much but just know you can definitely feel the springs and top is not soft like you would expect.,3 out of 5 stars review
12/1/2023,"I don't undersrand the five-star reviews. You can literally feel the springs while laying on this mattress.

I did buy this for my 7-year-old son. He probably doesn't notice the springs like I do, because he is still so small, but I want it to last a while. It should be much better once I get a good mattress topper. 

I guess you get what you pay for, but I paid very similar for his twin-size bed that's now on his top bunk and it is lightyears better.

My final thoughts for anyone reading this review is just to be prepared to buy a mattress topper. The support is there from the pocket springs, but it lacks much needed cushion.

I guess you",3 out of 5 stars review

I gave it to my 20 year old son and he loves it, he said it the best mattress he has ever had. I just thought is was probably to firm for me.

10/22/2023,I let this mattress air for 72 hours as recommended it did expand to full capacity however the outer ridge of the bed is very hard the mattress itself is decent for the price I did however end up buying a mattress pad it absolutely fixed the problem the problem with this mattress is the coil system,3 out of 5 stars review
6/25/2013,"We bought this mattress as a replacement for a nice queen set that was old and causing my back to hurt. We didn't want to pay for a whole new set and hoped that just getting a new mattress would be enough. This mattress is a good value but after a few weeks we realized it's just not firm enough for us. We're returning it and getting something else but for a simple, cheap mattress it's fine and would be great for kids or guest rooms. I wish I would have bought a few of these for our kids bunk beds instead of the ones we have. Some reviews mentioned that it ""collapses"" when you sit on the sides but we didn't find this to be a problem. If you're looking for a high quality mattress just spend the extra money for something else but if you just n...",3 out of 5 stars review
7/26/2016,"The quality seems very good and it is very comfortable, on the firm side.  We have it in our guest bedroom so it will not get a lot of use so I expect it to serve us for a few years.  Even if it only lasted a year you would be money ahead just to buy one of these every year than pay $1,500+",3 out of 5 stars review
3/30/2011,"When I first got my mattress in a box, I thought there was no way a gueen size mattress was in that small of a box, but sure enough there was. They had sucked all the air out, so it looked small in the box , but it quickly fluffed up, and out, to a full size queen mattress. I have slept on it for a week now, and It doesn't sleep as well as I had hoped. One thing is, when you set on the side of the mattress it smashes down to about one inch. I did messure it, with nothing on it but sheets, and it does messure 8 full inches. When laying on it, it is very noisey, and goes flat under my weight. I am a 250lb person sleeping in it. I guess I could get use to it. Not sure yet, if I'm gonna replace it with a thicker more sturdy mattress, or not. It...",3 out of 5 stars review
5/13/2020,"Decent enough for the price. It's soft and comfortable, but the really frustrating part is that all four corners collapse if you sit on the corners of the bed. This happens to both mattresses that I bought so not just a fluke. Definitely don't recommend for a large adult, but works for young kids.",3 out of 5 stars review
3/21/2017,"It's firm enough, but not sure it's a long term solution for an adult. Handles would be nice, but it doesn't have them. It's a bed in a box, so don't expect too much. For what it is, I think it's much better than others in its category.  Measurements are pretty accurate, but there is a slight curve and indent on one part. Again, it's a bed in a box, so I wasn't expecting perfection. I use a memory foam topper, also, and that adds to the bed's comfort.",3 out of 5 stars review
11/7/2023,"I got this mattress at $62, I expected 8” and supportive.  It's more like 5” and light duty, you can feel the coils individually. I had to buy topper to make it more comfortable.  Good thing it's for a light 8 year old.",3 out of 5 stars review

8/30/2013,"The mattress arrived in a timely fashion. It only took minutes to unwrap it with help. The mattress unfolded and opened to the twin size expected; however, since the mattress was purchased for a twin daybed, the support I expected from merely sitting on it was much less than anticipated. It was too soft ( for my likes) and it might be somewhat uncomfortable for an adult. The kids might enjoy it though.",3 out of 5 stars review

6/19/2013,"I had a top of the line matrress for almost 20 years and decided it was time to change it. So I made the purchase to this simply 8-1. The Walmart service was incredible it was delivered free of charge and arrived before it's estimated delivery date.
The matrress itself is of lower quality than I am used to. Once you open the packaging it inflates to its normal size. The coils inside are made of plastic and the gel part of the matrress is rather soft for my taste. After I used it for one night I contemplated returning it and going back to my old matrress, but since I had already open the box and plastic wrapping It could not be returned.
I decided to give it a try for a bit longer maybe I'll grow accustomed to it.

4/3/2022,So I purchased 2 of the king size 8in mattresses for my sons rooms and well for a mattress in a box its ok!! The reasons I gave ot 3 stars is because (1). The mattresses are not the true size as advertised..its says its supposed to be 80x76x8 but they really are a 77x74x8 surprisingly it actually rose up to the 8 inches...I even purchased the Zinus king size metal frame so it would match up but it does not! the other reason for the 3 stars is the edges have no support it will put you in the floor....but overall the firmness is good...But they really need to fix the size and the edges of the mattresses!!!,3 out of 5 stars review

7/30/2021,"This is a bed that should not be used everyday.   From reading the  one star ratings the problem is that the bed performs very well until the springs give out.    Failures happen as soon as two months for some,  1 year after daily use, and sometimes 2 years after daily use.   The 10 year warranty is misleading.   The product cannot perform daily for 10 years.   People are so disappointed that they just dump the mattress.",3 out of 5 stars review
9/18/2016,After seeing all the reviews about this mattress I had no doubt that I would purchase this mattress for my son's room. But after receiving it I'm not sure that it was a five star rated buy. You can feel the metal coils in it when you move and it seems a bit thin. My son has no complaints though so overall for the price it is a decent buy.,3 out of 5 stars review
1/30/2013,"I have had this mattress for about a week now, and I was a little surprised when I opened it. It does not look anywhere near as thick as it does on the website! I honestly thought they had shipped me the wrong item. The mattress is comfortable, but I have woken up every night sweating! It seems that the memory foam in it is trapping my body heat. I have to get out of bed just to cool down, which I never did before.
All in all, it's a nice mattress if you're looking for something quick and affordable, but I probably would purchase something else if you can afford it.
I had it shipped to the store, and the box fit fine in my Honda Civic sedan. That is definitely one benefit to the mattress!",3 out of 5 stars review
3/27/2014,"Looks great came in a box and expanded,however even having it out for several days and finally laying on it I think it would still need a box spring, we purchase these mattresses to go with our kids platform bed that we also purchased from Walmart..the beds were great and great directions and this mattress fit on the bed,overall it was ok for the value and what we needed for now for a three year old",3 out of 5 stars review
6/23/2013,"I was not sure whether to buy this since I have read the good and bad reviews mainly I was worried if it would hold up considering how some people have said that it more or less caved in after a while. I am overweight 174 and knew I was going to use this mattress much more than the average person. I suffer from fibromyalgia and have a great deal of pain and fatigue so the majority of my time IS in bed.

I have had this almost a month and it is holding up very well, it is quite firm so at times depending on how you are laying down it can hurt a bit but if I got a bit of a memory foam topper that could be easily resolved.

For the price YOU CAN'T GO WRONG!!",3 out of 5 stars review
4/29/2013,"It was easy enough to unpack and set up by myself, which is saying alot because I have an injured wrist, but was still able to handle it alone.

I am still in the first few weeks of sleeping on it, but hope it stands the test of time.",3 out of 5 stars review
7/5/2016,"This mattress is super comfortable and light. Good for my 3 year olds big girl bed. Only concern was the warning on the box on the flammability of foam.  There are a lot of chemicals on the mattress that they put on to protect the foam from catching fire. I wish that I had done some more research about that before buying it for my child. Seems like a great mattress so far, just not sure I want my child sleeping on a mattress with all of those chemicals.",3 out of 5 stars review

I had guests over the weekend and would have liked to have had the mattress, but thanks to the incompetence of UPS, it wasn't delivered on time (scheduled delivery was Friday).

I slept on this mattress for a week straight and encountered back pain. I've never had an issue with any other mattress before or back pain for that matter. I bought a memory foam topper and the back pain has subsided considerably but is still there. I am not using a box spring or box frame and the mattress seems to be fine by itself.

The height of the bed is a little over 8 inches. Perfect and accurate. I'm happy about that. But the width on the other hand measures to be 56.5 inches exact, not 60. I measured it a few times to be sure I wasn't doing it wrong.

The mattress arrived in two days, great!  It was rolled in a box, and was not heavy.  I unrolled and set it up easily on the bed.

Firmness-  Many said this is a firm mattress.  I would call it medium.  (We would have liked it to be ""firm"".)

Quality -  was decent for the price.  The spring wire is not as  heavy of a gauge as I thought it would be.   Mattress cover is of decent quality.  Although it moves easily, and bunches  up.  Adding a mattress cover made this even worse.

12/21/2020,This was the cheapest mattress i could find and at that time that was all that mattered.  It is very soft....Too soft in my opinion. Also you can feel the springs in places. Would be great for a kids bed or guest room but after only 5 months of nightly use by my husband and I we already need to replace it. Waking up in pain every morning SUCKS. Wish i would have been able to save this money until i could afford something better to put it towards.,3 out of 5 stars review
6/19/2014,"I bought this one thinking the king-size mattress is a usual bed size, It never to came to my mind to measure first the bed-frame to get exact size for the mattress, it's give me 4 inches space between the bed and the mattress. I already had a full size of this slumber bed and that was great, but this king-size mattress I don't feel comfy, it doesn't expand to well that i expected, kind of sloppy...But my son loved to sleep on it, he said it is soft. Totally i gave 3 stars for it.....",3 out of 5 stars review
9/6/2016,"I really needed a mattress as cheap as possible and I was eyeballing this one out for a while. I saw the pretty good reviews so I just went for it. It arrived on time and the box was not damaged. I open it up and followed the instructions and let it inflate or whatever it does. It is quite thin. I had been sleeping on an air mattress so I couldnt wait to get back in a bed. The first night was ok then every night after that you can definitely hear the springs, and personally I get a backache. I would recommend it for a guest bedroom or where it is not used on the regular. I would not buy another one for my every night bed.",3 out of 5 stars review

The mattress is supposed to be 8 inches high, but mine reconstituted itself just to 6.5 inches. The foam did not fully inflate to 8 inches as stated on the website. The top is soft and the foam covers the metal springs well, but on the sides, you can feel the springs that are just covered with a thin fabric.

There is no dimension on this comforter, sewn or in the print, to make it appear dimensional as the photo leads you to believe. When I bought it I thought the squares were stitched and it would look layered - No!! It is just a print. And while this is okay for many comforters, I would not have chosen this bright and busy of a pattern if I had known it was just printed without any stitching or layers to break it up. The design as it is will most likely fade on the first wash - this I am concerned about.

My only complaint about the Dorel mattress is that it's an inch shorter than other twin mattresses.

The Slumber 1 8"" mattress that was shipped does not look like the one in the picture online. It is advertised to have independent coils to minimize motion, but it feels just like another (cheaper) mattress that we have that's not advertised to reduce motion.

9/16/2014,"Human sleep needs vary by age and amongst individuals, and sleep is considered to be adequate when there is no daytime sleepiness or dysfunction. Moreover, self-reported sleep duration is only moderately correlated with actual sleep time as measured by actigraphy,[31] and those affected with sleep state misperception may typically report having slept only four hours despite having slept a full eight hours.[32]

Right now, it's sitting in my living room while I try to figure out how to get it up to my bedroom and the old mattress out.

1/30/2015,"Wow after reading all the great reviews on this mattress I decided ok let me give it a try. First night, too soft so I thought, well maybe it hadn't fully compressed so let me see if it's a bit firmer the next night. Nooo my legs were numb and I'm a side sleeper so when I woke up, my whole side was just numb. then I noticed that the mattress that I have doesn't look like the picture. I called the company to complain and was told that I have the ""newer"" version... needless to say that it went back the next day.

3/16/2021,I got this mattress back in February of 2016 I'm 5'3 185lbs the bed lasted about 3 years or a little less than before the springs started to pop. I sleep in the middle and All of 2019 and 2020  I suffered from back pain because the bed formed large indents.  Ive kept it for so long because I thought I could remedy it by purchasing a mattress topper but after a while that didn't work either. I tried to look for a warranty on the bed but couldn't find it. So I've finally had enough and decided to purchase a new mattress I went with a different brand this time around.,3 out of 5 stars review

The springs in the mattress don't allow for sinking as I expected. The bed IS soft but firmer than what I wanted. However, there is still hope because I haven't slept on it yet; I just laid on it briefly before having to leave. Part of the problem could be that it may not have been expanded all the way because I laid on it a couple of minutes after it expanded from the box. The factory air compresses the mattress and rolls it up so it will fit in a small box. Remarkable, really. So, perhaps it needed more time to fluff out or something. I will update when I've slept on it. Overall, so far, it seems like a good q...",3 out of 5 stars review

2/26/2016,"I ordered online because, 1st it was on sale & 2nd I didn't have a way to get a mattress home from the store. I was amazed how they packaged this mattress into a box and how nicely it unfolded and became a mattress! The only complaint that I have was that it smelled funny, kind of a musty smell. With no way to get it back into the box or carry it into a store, I sprayed Fabrezz on it and left the sheets off of it to air out. We'll see. Hopefully, the smell goes away.",3 out of 5 stars review

This is not a mattress for a bigger person because yu will wake up in pain.

Unfortunately, when I therefore ordered exactly the same mattress again (because after five years of constant use and mistreatment the old one had developed a slight depression where my heavy husband's torso was) the new one looks identical to the old but is dramatically more firm -- so firm that I've had to order a different mattress. I should say that I much prefer bouncier (softer) pocketed springs, not just firm springs with a layer of soft foam or whatever on top, because I find that that supports me better. That kind of mattress seems increasingly hard to find in USA. So if you are looking for a...",3 out of 5 stars review

The mattress is very firm. It has a nice, but thin, little pillow top. It was way to hard by itself so I added a puffy mattress pad, a fluffy comforter, and a high quality 2 inch memory foam topper on top of all that. Then my sheets. NOW it's comfortable.

The reason I ordered online was because I liked that it was compressed for shipping and I was also pressed for shopping while out of the country. Because they compress it, this particular mattress does not have any support on the outer frame so getting in and out of bed at times you feel the cheapness of the product.

Oh, it does come in a box that's smaller than the actual size of the mattress, even taking into account that the mattress is rolled -up.",3 out of 5 stars review
10/2/2019,It was delivered to the right place quickly and the Walmart associate who helped me load this AND the bed frame into my car was really amazing. Smelled fresh and looked clean out of the packaging and it expanded in a good amount of time. Giving it 4 stars just because the firmness wasn't right for me and my pressure points are aching. Having to sleep on a separate pillow for comfort and currently looking online for a thick mattress topper.,3 out of 5 stars review
10/22/2012,"Mattress arrived promptly. It fit the trundle frame under my daybed. Was fairly easy to unwrap (I'm 74 and did it myself). Has a nice appearane and is firm. No one has slept on it yet, but I'm sure it will do for visitors. Not sure I would want to sleep on it all the time. I guess if I were going to, I would by a memory foam mattress topper.",3 out of 5 stars review
5/16/2015,"The mattress is nice, very easy to set up and really nice condition. However I am a belly sleeper and my back is hurting after just 2 days. I wish we would have gotten the 10"" I don't know if they will let us exchange or not . But I don't know if I should just get another or what to do.",3 out of 5 stars review
4/28/2018,"After opened it out this mattress, the smell is really strong, like something is wet and damp, I opened the window let the air coming to the room, hoping it'll get over the bad smell, but it still there. I am thinking whether to return or not? I have not use it at all, I brought this is for guest room, it's not going to use it till July!",3 out of 5 stars review

5/20/2012,As good as any $600 mattress that I tried. Best bang for the buck out there.,3 out of 5 stars review
1/14/2012,The matress is really plush. It tends to make my back hurt but maybe its because Im used to the firm matresses. However its a great look and comfort for the buck if you like plush matresses.,3 out of 5 stars review
9/3/2015,"If you are looking for a comfortable mattress for a low price, this is something yo look at. I purchased this for my son who is attending college and needed a comfy mattress for the year.",3 out of 5 stars review
1/14/2015,The mattress is okay. I wish it were little harder as I prefer hard mattress. It is hard to judge when you shop online. It was delivered 5 days later than the planned shipping date.,3 out of 5 stars review
5/18/2016,"Love the way it came in a box. Easy to get where I needed it. Hysterical when it unrolled! A hard mattress, but comfortable. Using on a bed that will be used occasionally.",3 out of 5 stars review
3/16/2019,Its comfortable when you lie down. I have been sleeping on the mattress for about five weeks and lately wake up with a backache. I will try a memory foam topper to see if it helps,3 out of 5 stars review
3/22/2016,I had purchased the same twin mattress which was so comfortable. The queen does not have the same comfort and feel that it may not have expanded to its fullest height.,3 out of 5 stars review
7/3/2019,Three months ago my response in the review would be VERY different. My Bed in a box was perfect until the springs concaved causing physical pain and other issues. The bed has a ten-year warranty and Zinus refused to send a replacement as promised.,3 out of 5 stars review
12/7/2014,This is comfortable enough but definitely requires a mattress cover as this is encased in a cotton that will pill easily and absorb anything it comes in contact with.Needed a bed quickly.,3 out of 5 stars review
9/12/2015,"The mattress was packed in the box. It did make pick up and delivery easy.
According to website description, the mattress was rated as firm (3).
It is soft, it reminds me airbed, which lost some air.",3 out of 5 stars review
4/11/2018,I ordered the twin  it says it's 75by39 now it is only 73 in  now I got a 4 inch gap my bed was 77  in but I figured 2 in not bad but 4 is to much what can I do,3 out of 5 stars review
11/26/2019,"Very comfortable mattress, not disappointed about that aspect. The edges of the mattress are not firm. Sitting on the side of the bed feels precarious. The middle of the bed feels a bit higher than the rest. Would not order this again.",3 out of 5 stars review
3/6/2016,"I order a queen size and when we put it up it was the same size as our full size bed! We needed a bigger bed, not the same size! It sleeps fine but it's not big enough.",3 out of 5 stars review
11/28/2015,"If you cannot leave the house to purchase a standard mattress, this will do but it won't be as firm. It ended up costing $40 more than the one I moved to other room and is not as nice.",3 out of 5 stars review
4/18/2011,"This item arrived quickly and was ingeniously vaccuum packed. I unrolled it, unfolded it and it inflated to normal size within minutes after puncturing the plastic wrapping. A $200 queen mattress did the trick.",3 out of 5 stars review
5/5/2016,This is the 2nd we've purchased. It's a great guest room mattress that doesn't get a lot of use . We got 4 years out of the last one so it was a great choice for the money.,3 out of 5 stars review
8/27/2019,Get what you pay for. If it's your everyday sleeper you're gonna start getting some back pain in about a month. Would not recommend without a good memory foam topper to go with it.,3 out of 5 stars review
11/26/2012,GET THE MATTRESS IN TIME FOR MY GUEST BED ROOM. AFTER THE FIRST FEW NIGHTS MY GUEST STATED THAT IT WAS SINKING IN THE MIDDLE. SO I WILL BE RETURNING IT TODAY. PLEASE SAVE YOU MONEY IF YOU WANT YOUR GUEST TO HAVE A SMOOTH NIGHTS REST.,3 out of 5 stars review
7/1/2020,I thought the mattress would be firmer with springs. I mean it's ok but its kinda squishy.  It's for my travel trailer so it's acceptable.  I do like that it came in a box which was easy to life. I mean it's ok.,3 out of 5 stars review
12/7/2014,I paid for expiedited shipping and it came way late. the mattress itself is ok but when you get it out of the box it springs open so make sure you have room for it to expand,3 out of 5 stars review
8/23/2019,"For what it is and how much it was, it's a good deal. I would not suggest buying this mattress without a topper. You can feel the springs as you sit and lay on it. But with a topper, it gives just the right support to make it comfortable.",3 out of 5 stars review

5/26/2019,"Great product for the first 2 years of owning it. With proper rotating, at almost the exact 2 year mark it is now killing my back. Typical Walmart product; great for its price range, but dies a lot sooner than other brands",3 out of 5 stars review
2/4/2020,This mattress is OK for a temporary guest bed.  For me with the back problems I have it was replaced for a locally bought mattress costing substantially more,3 out of 5 stars review
3/14/2019,Not as comfy as we thought! Bed is a little hard and with no give! Have been sleeping on it for a week now and hoped it would get better. Husband loves the bed. Just not for me!,3 out of 5 stars review
11/9/2014,"When you lay down on this mattress it does holds you up well, however if you sleep on your side or press on it with your hands you can feel the individual coils and even hear them. More cushion is needed.",3 out of 5 stars review
2/10/2020,It's not the greatest . But you get what you pay for. I can already feel the springs after only having it for 2 months (nothing crazy tho) i think it's better for kids not adults.,3 out of 5 stars review
5/12/2015,it is a good mattress for the price it would have been nice if they told you it is a squishy mattress not much firmness at all. other than that it rolled out and up really quick and was at height in a couple hours,3 out of 5 stars review
10/25/2015,My husband doesn't seem to mind it but its way too firm for my liking. Im planning to buy a mattress topper to soften it up. Ok for the prize but not my taste.,3 out of 5 stars review
10/3/2019,"Pretty firm I'm a side sleeper and woke up pretty achy, but my husband is a back sleeper and liked it so just depends on what kind of sleeper you are and mattress you prefer if you like firm it'd be the bed for you!",3 out of 5 stars review
9/4/2012,"When the box arrived, I thought they sent the wrong item. The mattress came rolled up in a small rectangular box and unraveled when we opened it. It definitely is not a firm mattress. We got it for our toddlers first twin bed so it is fine and worth the money but we will probably buy a new one in a few years as I think it will be too soft by then. So depending on who and what you are buying it for, will depend upon whether it is worth it to you or not. Good luck!",3 out of 5 stars review
3/27/2016,If you have back issues please stay away from this mattress. this mattress is for normal people and best life longer. But if you have Spine issues or back pain you suffer and suffer from your back. other then is great mattress stronger mattress you will need some addition like some foam on top.,3 out of 5 stars review
9/7/2015,"It was shipped fast. Easy to open. Slight chemical smell at first but gone next day. Expanded mostly right away, fully expanded in 32 hrs. To soft. No support. Im a big guy though (6'1' 325lbs) but i feel my frame when i move. Its decent for its price. Good for guest not regular use.",3 out of 5 stars review
2/19/2012,"i do not think full review at this early onset would be complete. i will say that the convenience of a simple box that can be hauled in anyone's subcompact car is of excellent value in itself. the item was easy to maneuver, easy to open, and did the self inflate thing well. i have not spent a full night on this bed, but it really does feel comfortable. i do highly recommend this mattress for its convenience and price to anyone in need of a quick mattress. (remember, though, once opened, it cannot 'reshrink'). i cannot attest to longevity or ongoing comforts, but the starting shows well.",3 out of 5 stars review
1/20/2016,"BE CAREFUL with this order, it'll make you think you're buying a queen/king sized bed, and a single will arrive at your doorstep (as it did mine). ...The options aren't at all intuitive or correct in any way shape or form in that specific order form.
...Otherwise, the bed is very comfortable, I haven't slept this well in years.
