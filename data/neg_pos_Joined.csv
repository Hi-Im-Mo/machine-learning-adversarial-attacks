They also said I booked the mounting service with third party provider and take it up with them basically was the response i got",0
1,11/1/2023,"I love Vizio that’s always my go to brand I have always loved their products, after buying this Television I will be looking into other brands. The Tv won’t hook up to the internet and just won’t turn on some days, I have to unplug them plug back in to get the tv to turn on. Picture quality it great, I might have just gotten a dud",0
2,11/22/2023,"I ordered a Vizio 50"" Class V-Series 4L UHD LED TV on the Walmart Website on Nov 14th.  On Nov 16th I received a confirmation that the TV was delivered.  IT WAS NOT.  I have been battling with Walmart ever since.  It is false advertisement and BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE by Walmart when they do not stand by their products that they sell on their website.  Even if it is shipped by the third-party seller.  Walmart should HONOR the sell and ship a replacement item to the customer.  Walmart STILL has the item on thier website and will not ship me a replacement.  Walmart has partnered with the third party sell and should stand by Walmart's commitment to service the customer.  I specifically told several people that I did NOT want a refund and that I wa...",0
3,12/5/2023,"It didn't work right out of the box. Nothing but vertical and a few horizontal lines. Vizio said it was bad and needed to be replaced by Walmart said I can only return for refund even though they do have a replacement at the store close to me. They delivered it and I had friends set it up since I just had surgery so for me to take apart, rebox and take this 70 inch TV back to the store in my Prius is asking too much. Plus I'll have to deal with the installation of the replacement . Now I've seen people complain about how long it takes Walmart to process refunds and that also isn't fair. According to the promised warranty paperwork that came with the TV Vizio said for TV's over 50 inches they send service people out to fix it, but when I cal...",0
4,12/24/2023,"I ordered  75” Vizio TV and just put it up, but there is damage to the inside of the TV. It was never dropped, and this (see attachment) is what I found when I took off the cardboard protection. I never received an invoice for this product. The only invoice I have is from PayPal, nothing from Walmart. I did purchase a four-year warranty, item %23 18760A2076554307ACB56ACA99741A2F
Please advise.
Thank you.",0
5,12/2/2023,"Bought the 65inch Vizio online and it arrived from FedEx with one plastic strap and coming through the bottom of the box and low and behold once i pulled the tv out it was damaged. On top of that trying to call my local walmart in Woodhaven,MI to see what i can do about it and im being transferred to their online order and pickup department  just to be hung up on after waiting for them to pickup 6 times in a row.... So disappointed only one star because its required it would be none if i could.",0
6,9/7/2023,"From the moment the TV arrived, albeit quickly, within 24hrs, I had a feeling it wasn't our best purchase.  Driver shows up and says “ I dont see how they expect one guy to deliver this thing - come get it “.  To then notice the TV was hauled laid flat in a truck bed- big no no, says right on box in images to haul vertically ONLY. 
The resolution of the TV seems subpar to expectations.  Our old TCL TV we replaced with this one was about five years old and had a  much better picture. 
Games played through xbox are super bright or blurred by poor res.
If this hadnt been our third, yes third! new TV in as many weeks, first one cracked screen, second had a line in picture(both from another store and different brand so thought, lets try somewher...",0
7,8/4/2023,Ordered a 75 inch television as soon as the driver dropped it off took it straight in the house took pictures of the box because it was damaged really bad and then took the TV out and the whole screen has been cracked and lines all down the screen.  looks like it was throw out the back of the truck. I see why shipping Was so fast now.,0
8,8/11/2023,"Came broken, still waiting on refund. Took forever for them to come back to pick it up for the return. Didn't come the first pick up date we scheduled. Then didn't come second time. Ended up getting a text from the guy to schedule a different pickup day and time in which they finally came. Pick up Guy was nice. Just frustrated  with this experience. Delivered via Pilot and picked back up via pilot.",0
9,10/22/2023,"If you buy a TV Get it from the store and don't choose the delivery option. 
First, the date was sent with a tracking number and they delivered on a different day.  Second, they left the unit on my driveway in the middle of the day and I did not receive a message until the end of the day for the delivery. Third, the box has a big hole on the front part of the box looks like a forklift or pallet jack shape hit the box. Fourth, I opened the box to examine the unit and surprise!!! The screen was cracked where the hole in the box was, still waiting for my refund after a week of the return.",0
10,10/14/2023,The tv was broke the delivery person wasn't able to handle it I have the delivery on ring and the pick up along with picks of the broken tv  and Walmart have yet to refund my money or replace the tv it will be 4 weeks next week. I keep getting messages to review the product but no resolve,0
11,9/13/2023,"I'm a bit disappointed that I have to wait 48 hrs before I can report that my purchase was not delivered even after being alerted that it was delivered. I have never had to report on a missing delivery so navagating this process isn't easy. 
I would also suggest that delivery notifications come with a picture of package delivered as other delivery services do. 
In this instance it appears that my package went back to be inspected for some reason but it doesn't say that it went out to be delivered again yet it does say it was left at my door.",0
12,10/11/2023,"I've always been a huge fan of Vizio TVs for years, so recently needed a new one and purchased this one bc I'm committed to brand loyalty. First one I received was used (power cord was still plugged in the TV) and the screen was shattered. Went through the trouble of returning it to Walmart, then decided to get the same brand/series. Now, the second one has network connectivity issues even though my router is only 10 feet from the TV.  This happens about every 20-30 minutes, in the middle of whatever I'm watching, and won't reconnect for 5-10 minutes. No other device in my home has this issue, so I know it is not my wifi. Such a pain! Will be returning this TV and switching brands!",0
13,9/26/2023,"This is my second time within the last month and a half that I have a screen problem. Right out of the box I had dead spots on the top left corner of my screen. They are visible when there is a white or light background. I been through TCL and Vizio with the same problem. I have no idea if it is from handling the product, or a manufacturer defect. I even gave the benefit of the doubt that the screen would fix itself. This process has been frustrating to say the least. I just want a quality product and enjoy a tv.",0
14,12/30/2023,"Aside from the home not being available in my country. Using the buttons from the remote to open up Netflix is useless. I can click the button 100 times and it would not open up Netflix until it wants to. I usually have to turn the tv off and on for it to work. Also, sometimes the screen completely blanks out on me for no reason at all. I’m unable to do anything with it. Even using the microphone button on the remote does not work for me. Not happy with this at all!",0
15,12/17/2023,Order left outside in the rain propped up sideways. Hopefully it will still function properly when it is set up simple knock on the door would've had it unloaded for you and brought inside out of the elements,0
16,11/11/2023,I received a used tv. Really disappointed. Screen cracked and spotty. A person's Netflix was signed in and all! On the box stated reduced rate. I payed full price for this TV. I returned it have to keep shopping around.,0
17,12/18/2023,I bought this on Black Friday and it came with foot prints all over it and the whole screen was busted.  I spoke to a customer service rep and they said they'd refund it but I haven't received anything for it.,0
18,11/25/2023,Unpackaged tv as per the Instructions. And once I turned it on the screen said Vizio then turned white with a black bar on the left side of the screen,0
19,12/13/2023,"I have never had any other brand TVs besides Vizio. The left side has stripes from top to bottom, the right top hand corner is blotchy, not to mention the volume is WAY too loud but then you can't hear it so you keep having to adjust the volume. I bought this 7 months ago. Disappointed would be an understatement",0

I have owned 2 other Vizio tv's that gave us 10 years of service ..... but this one is a disaster
It started giving a flashing bar at the bottom .... followed by lines across the center of the screen 
Started at about 7 months of use and now it is about to go out ......
Not sure what to do with this thing",0
24,4/30/2023,I had this tv for two months then lines started showing up and after having it for only 5 months I got to turn it on and the tv was grey with multiple lines thankfully Vizio did have a warranty so we'll be able to get a new one but it's that's not something you want to do then do NOT waste time buying this tv,0
25,9/19/2023,"I was left in the front of the house….upside down and a damp concrete!
Customer service said they would send another one AND THEN TAKE THIS ONE BACK.
The appointment was right on time by himself, poor guy.
He was only the delivery service.
He apologized that he was only told it was a PICK UP.",0
26,12/31/2023,"Was excited to get this tv after reading the reviews / spending years without one. 

Unfortunately, the tv (which was dropped on the porch without a signature or even a knock) arrived damaged. The photo attached is from the first 30 minutes of use and the entire right side of the screen has degraded in the weeks since. What a waste of money. 

Walmart doesn’t have the option to speak with a representative to resolve, only a chatbot that talks you in circles without any customer support. Please offer a refund for damaged goods - or easy option for replacement of faulty merchandise!",0
27,7/15/2023,Will not connect to the Wi-Fi. I have to reconfigure the piece of crap EVERY time I turn the TV on. Waste of time and waste of money,0
28,2/14/2024,"I bought this TV and when it got delivered the screen was shattered.  There was no remote, power cord or legs.  I immediately let them know and was told to take it back to any Wal Mart store with bar code sent as receipt for refund by March 3.  I took it back and was told they would not except it because I did not buy it from that store.  The guy I was dealing with Ryan was the most rude unhelpful excuse of a manager and should be demoted to stock boy.  Then I get in touch with someone from the on line side of things and nothing works and he really cannot help and it would be 48 hours before problems would be fixed and 72 hours later and nothing.  He did tell me I would most likely have to take it to a fed ex to return but he was not real s...",0

36,8/10/2023,This is how my TV arrived. I got a refund but have to first box it up and set up a pickup what an inconvenience for me. Very disappointing.,0
37,12/30/2022,"TV worked great when i got it in march, then around September the display had random lines on it, it started to glitch out on me and started to flicker on and off. This is 6 months after getting the tv, now its essentially a 50 inch tv shaped paperweight that works sometimes. The worst part of all is that the tv I got was a gift and since i dont have the receipt for it vizo won't honor the warranty meaning i cant even get it replaced. I highly recommend that if you get this tv then please be wary, and keep the receipt for it if you can.",0
38,12/14/2021,"tv arrived quickly ,,(only one man truck)delivered it.   let tv sit in house 24 hours before unpacking and pluging it in.... the tv setup and worked for about 12 hours then started scan lines over the 2/3 of the picture ...Not all channels in watch free  did not work about 50 to 60% have lines over the picture...",0

40,11/1/2022,"our tv did not come with a remote, we spent 2 hours on the phone to be hung up on then started a chat with someone that said someone else would come on and that never happened either! ill never purchase from Walmart online again! now we have a tv that we cant watch! great $800 not well spent!!",0
41,11/11/2022,"Worst TV ever. Every time I want to stream YouTube or videos from my phone it won’t work. Complete waste of money! I can’t even use my TV! I highly recommend looking into another item as this TV has caused problems since I got it. In multiple occasions when I use apps like HBO, Netflix, or the freeTV service it provides, the only thing that will show is a black screen! I have never written a review before on Walmart but I would like to save anyone else the trouble than to purchase this item.",0
42,10/14/2022,"If I could give this 0 stars I would. My previous tv was a Vizio and it has work beautifully for 10 years. This is why when I decided to get a new tv with a larger screen I got another Vizio. But this is a piece of junk. It work perfect for about  9 months. Now when it does turn on it has a 6” strip down the middle that is all messed up and white dotted light that run across the screen. I have never left a review on an item before but this is ridiculous, a $400 tv should work for more than 9 months. I used to trust Vizio's products but not any more. So mad and disappointed.",0

49,12/17/2023,I bought the 50” Vizio tv on November 9th. It stopped working on December the 12th and Walmart refused to even give me store credit. This does not make me a happy camper. Just avoid them so you don’t get stuck with a piece of junk,0

59,2/5/2023,I bought this TV in June 2022 and already has streaks and lines running through it with  a purple tint. It’s crazy to pay this much for something and not even last 1 year. My advice “buyer beware “!,0
60,9/23/2022,Flashed green since day 1 and finally today it was unresolvable. I would highly recommend NOT getting this TV and avoiding it at all costs. Waste of $300,0

This is not a 50” tv like this says, once you take it out and measure it is about 45”. I have one the size but I didn’t remember what size it was cause I got it a long time ago. So if you want something that is a actually 50” get the 55”, if you want a 60” get the 65”. They all are probably gonna be 5” less in size. Now I’m returning this one and getting a bigger one.",0
69,6/28/2023,"Do not recommend. I had this TV for an about a year when these random horizontal lines appeared one day after a software update.

115,5/4/2023,"What is the driver thinking when you are delivering to a BUSINESS address, the business is clearly CLOSED since it was after 6:00PM.  And the driver leaves TWO 55"" LED TV'S AT THE FRONT DOOR IN THE RAIN.  Brilliant.....
And no discernment on the part of the driver that it just might be a good idea to reschedule the delivery??  Someone in corporate needs to get out in the trenches and see what is really happening!!!!",0
116,1/9/2024,"What can I say? This TV only lasted 13 months. Screen randomly went black yesterday. I had my old TV for 10 years and sold it for $50. It was still working great.

Decided to “upgrade” and this thing couldn't even make it 2 years. Vizio couldn't care less. They did nothing. Based on how long this product lasted and based on Vizio's response, I do not recommend you purchase Visio products. There's another company that makes quality products and their stand behind their products.

I will contact Walmart to see if there is anything they can do and I will update this review accordingly.",0
117,12/29/2023,Please don’t waste your money. I have been a long time customer of Vizio but unfortunately every 2-3 years the TVs stop connecting to the internet and streaming is impossible. I have 2 Vizios that stopped working recently. One from 2015 the other from 2021 😠. I cant believe I continue to waste my money on Vizio. The warranty is only 1 year and after that your on your own. Horrible TV. Buying a different brand. Do not waste your money.,0
118,8/26/2023,"If I could give a negative star, I would!!! This tv has awful quality! It keeps lagging, doesn't have a lot of apps to download like other tvs do. Even when I try to connect soemthing on my hdmi it won't let me click on the input or it won't even work. I've had this tv for less than a month and I've had to turn it off and unplug it sooo many times!!! So disappointed and I would never buy this brand again!!!",0
119,9/13/2023,"i will stay away from vizio products now.  netflix app makes the tv crash, unable to even load netflix, all other apps work but no netflix.

132,2/16/2024,I purchased a 65” Vizio flatscreen.. The tv came and the box was beat up. I opened the box and the tv was used.. had no cord or remote… The tv had scratches on the bottom. I returned it to Walmart in store. They initially did not want to take it back but they ended up doing so. I have still yet to reach anyone about getting a refund on my protection plan..,0
133,2/13/2024,ordered tv was supposed to be delivered next day. the other items we ordered were delivered but not the tv. store says it was delivered so only conclusion I can come to is that the driver kept the tv. we called the 1-800 number and they told us we had a package being delivered by fedex but when we received it it was only granola bars. called walmart and they said we received it with the rest of the groceries that were delivered the day after we placed the order but could not show us a picture of it being delivered. finally was able to get a ONE TIME refund. only will use in home delivery from now on where an actual employee delivers products.,0

Walmart says I must wait two days, it might show up.  FedEx says my address wasn't on shipping label.  Seller (scammer) conveniently does not answer phone and has no message on answering service.  I'm happy Walmart protects their consumers that trust our purchases are from them and only them.",0
136,2/4/2024,"The TV keeps shutting off by itself.  You will be watching a show and it will kick you right back out to the home screen. sometimes it takes hours before it works again, I would never buy this model again.

No one would answer phone in the Delivery dept and Driver closed out ticket knowing order was not the complete order. Spoke to 7 different Customer Service reps and not one took accountability. All offered to process refund. This was a surprise gift for my Sis in law and I am the one surprised as she now has a wall mount only and the surprise is foiled. How can Walmart tell me to request refund and REORDER…Why would i trust them on another order when they got this one messed up. Driver should not have closed out ticket because he took pic of the one item he delivered. Go elsewhere if you want Customer Ser...,0
138,2/12/2024,"I ordered this for next day pick up. All reviews of delivery (of most tvs on Walmart.com) show damage at receipt with little to no resolution from support. I opted to pick up. I ordered it and it showed availability at several locations. I picked one and the next day it informed me that it now wasn't available UNLESS I wanted shipping. I called customer service to where the person argued with me that my card wasn't charged and they immediately cancelled the order. I went on the website, it's still showing pick up today and in stock at the store. Now I have a ten day hold on $300 when I could have just gone to the store myself
To purchase and saved the headache. Do yourself a favor and get this from Target or ANYWHERE else",0
139,2/5/2024,"This is a review for the third party seller (Itronics). I purchased a 65"" Tv  from Walmart's third party seller Itronics. on the day I was supposed to receive it They e-mailed me and told me my order was canceled do to a delay in shipping.  I would have waited but they gave me no choice. I got a great price on this and I believe this is why they canceled this order. Very poor way to business. Wal-mart should step up and take care of this issue.",0
140,2/8/2024,"Disliked. Never received TV on delivery day. Called corporate today. The first person said it was still being delivered but delayed. She wanted to know if i wanted a refund.  I explained to her i ordered the TV for 199.99 and now the price was 399.00 but they would refund what i paid and the difference in the price. she explained that i could reorder the T.V. and it would be here tomorrow. 
She put me on hold and then a man picked up. He was rude and told me they wouldn't refund the price for the TV now. They will refund what i paid in 10 days and i would have to pay the difference even though none of this is my fault. Lost money from work to sit and what on it duy to the app said ot was out for delivery.  This morning it changed saying it ...",0
141,1/24/2024,the tv arrived and the packaging was fine. got it connected and it had large lines down the side. that is a problem with vizio. now i started the return the next day and its been 12 days and still no refund and cannot buy another tv until this one is refunded. i called several times and got absolutly no help. now they gave me a refund date that is more than 2 weeks past the date of delivery. i will never purchase a big ticket item from Walmart again. just waiting for my refund to go to best buy. again Walmart has the worst customer service ever!!!  I wish I couldve picked 0 stars but it forces you to pick at least 1.,0
142,11/22/2023,The driver was very very rude and cursing at my mother and everything. Also he was complaining about bring the tv up to my apartment like that's what I pay for. Also he said that my tv might be messed up because he didn't have help with the tv. I'm very disappointed and the driver needs to be checked because that wasn't right of him to be using foul language at my mother.,0

145,12/29/2023,The TV was great until a couple of days ago. The audio completely stopped working no matter what we did to try and fix it. It is not worth the trouble of loosing audio after only having it for about a year.,0
146,6/23/2023,Walmart hired a third party delivery company Spark and they stole my television forged a signature and never delivered. The worst part about is is Walmart never refunded my money or tried to deliver another television. They didn’t even try to contact the driver,0
147,10/6/2023,This tv stopped working after 3 years. There was no damage to it. The item is simply defective. These VZIO televisions tend to have issues with their back lights shorting out. It's more expensive to fix than to replace. Now all I see when I turn on the tv are multicolored lines!,0
148,7/4/2023,Got my 50 inch Vizio TV as a present middle of last year and today got like a white screen at the top called customer service but they couldn’t help and out of warranty and this was a present for me now it’s worthless. Do not buy this whatever you do.,0
149,8/9/2023,My family and I loved this TV when we first got it. The UI was pretty good and the definition held its own against my other tvs.  I had it about a year and a half and all of sudden after updating the screen started malfunctioning. Green lines appeared and would slow down. I updated the software and after doing so the tv became unusable.  I contacted Vizio to troubleshoot  find out my options and they told me there was nothing they could do because the warranty is for a year.  I asked to purchase parts and they told me they wont do that.  I have only bought Vizio tvs and after this I'll have to try a different brand. Maybe this model is a lemon but the experience with the support has pushed me to look elsewhere. If you believe in your produc...,0

152,8/5/2023,I've bought this tv a little over a year ago first 1 line appeared and I thought it be easier to keep them try to return now it has 5 lines vertical. I don't recommend spending almost $700 on a tv that doesn't even last a year. I've reach out to Visio to see there policy.,0
153,8/20/2023,"About a year after buying this tv, we started to get random black lines. They were thin and seemed to fade so we dealt with it. Today, in the middle of watching tv, the entire screen went black. It's on, but nothing works. I've turned it off and on several times and nothing. There's been absolutely no damage, it's been sitting in the same spot for the year and a half I've owned it. This is my 2nd Vizio, which replaced an older model that stopped supporting Hulu and various other apps after 3 years. I'll never buy another Vizio again.",0
154,3/12/2023,Picked this up for my mom in law. She has had another vizio tv for 9 years that works great still. she just wanted a bigger tv. This thing is terrible.  Developed lines all over the screens. The menu screens are messed up as well. Did a factory reset and nothing helped.,0

It worked fine last night and this is what happened when I turned it on this morning. It actually got worse, but I've unplugged it and will be trashing it, as I did the other. I'm extremely disappointed.

156,11/6/2022,the tv is great but the size is not accurate. I supposely bought a 50' . Once I got it my son installed it but when I saw it it lookt to small for me I used a measuring tape and is 44' not even the box it came in was 50' not cool.

You click the button on remote, the on light on the tv blinks a lot (haven't timed it) but the tv doesn't turn on. You wait and nothing. Then it stops blinking and then we click the on button again and then tv turns on. Weird. A tv should just turn on. Also, the button on the back of tv doesn't work to turn on tv either if tv has been off for a while.  Something seems wrong. This thing might be going back. Disappointed and frustrated Vizio!",0
162,12/26/2023,limited to what they want you to get. it has some cool features that would make it awesome if you didnt have to give up so many options to get those features . no internet browser options. have to use home app to cast to the tv which means if you want to let someone else cast to the tv then you have to add them to your google home account which basically will allow them access to all your media and files. if i wouldnt have gotten distracted by thier gimmicks of on demand tv built in then i could have had a Samsung and all you have to do with it is cast. simple . easy. google home is aweful and you are forced to use either google home or whatever the apple equivalent is. and i cant get my apps from my prime account even when logged into prim...,0

Slid the top portion of the box off, and was shocked at the amount of dust covering this “brand new” tv. Picked it up and noticed the power cable just balled up at the bottom. No neat folded wires and typical bread wrap like tie holding everything together. Then to top it off no remote or instructions. At this point I'm realizing this must've been a demo or returned TV.

191,2/11/2024,The TV was delivered to a different address.  We had to search adjacent apartment complexes until we found it.  It was apartment 903 but it was not my address.  Be careful next time.,0
192,11/1/2023,"It is not the item that I have an issue with it was the delivery.  I had contacted Walmart and ask them to please have the delivery person to place the TV on my patio in front of the door. I had a funeral to attend at 2:00pm  and was not sure what time it would arrive. It had been raining all morning and I did not want it to get rained on. Not only was the TV on my front pouch it was sticking out and anyone could have picked it up. It had started to rain by the time I returned home but luckily I was able to get it inside before it got wet.
Are people so lazy and incompetent in today's society that they only think of themselves. 
Someone needs to send me a fee warranty just in case something is wrong with it in the near future.",0
193,11/8/2023,"This TV turns itself off all the time or it backs out to the Home Screen several times in a few hours.  Have tried all the ‘fixes' with the sleep timer, etc with no change.  Have had it 31 days - one day over the return timeframe at Walmart.  Don't waste your money or time.  Now trying to get a resolution through Visio and it's a huge hassle.  I never do reviews but felt compelled to warn others to pass on this TV.",0
194,10/30/2023,"Do Not use Walmart delivery service. The drivers do not care where they leave packages regardless of delivery instructions I entered. 

This is a horrible service and the customer service is just as bad un informed and green. No one knows their jod or cares.

I will never use this service again. Good job Walnart 👏",0
195,12/5/2023,"This tv arrived as a combo purchase to include a wall mount and sound bar. After installing the wall mount and installing the tv, when programmed the tv had 2 vertical lines from top to bottom on the left side of the screen. Started a return thinking I could get a replacement tv. I could only do a return assuming because it was part of a combo purchase. No explanation was actually given. Had to purchase the same replacement tv for four $70 more. What a ripoff and sad customer service. The inconvenience during this whole situation is unacceptable and nonsense.",0
196,11/26/2023,"The WORST picture I've ever seen on a television!! The picture was so bad, my husband and I immediately re-boxed for return. Upon thinking about how horrible the picture was, we unboxed the television again thinking there must have been a protective plastic shield over the screen because there was NO WAY this Vizio could have picture quality this bad! There was no protective cover over the screen.  And once again, we re-boxed for return.  I am so very disappointed.",0
197,12/8/2023,I brought a 65 in Vizio they said they delivered it got to the house it was not delivered Walmart should have a plan on the TV an I'm battling to get the TV or my money back it's said that the customer half to go through this type of sh%23%23 an it's sad an they don't even got Walmart delivery they go through door dash an try to have that company pay u back after u brought it though Walmart I'm so disappointed it makes no since,0
198,12/20/2023,This TV sucks. It loses connection all the time. You can fix it sure with a google search but then it happens again. Call Vizio support and they won't return it. They do the same thing you've been doing and tell you it's fixed when it will happen again. I will never buy another Vizio product or a TV from Walmart.,0

202,11/11/2023,This is a piece of junk. I received this piece of junk on Sept 30 and it stop working exactly 31 days later. There's nothing I can do about it and I think that's what Walmart was counting on someone elderly to buy this with no idea what they were getting. Thanks Walmart,0
203,12/13/2023,Never received item and Walmart is siding with Fedx because they took a picture supposedly in front of my door. The problem is I them to send it to one of there location order to pickup and got a text first thing in the morning saying it was being rerouted they will let me know when I can pickup instead the driver left it in the front door. Supposedly. Walmart doesn’t want to help me I have proof I asked to be sent to a pickup location yet they did what they wanted. Very unsatisfied customer,0
204,11/10/2023,"My TV was delivered with STICKERS on it saying ""deliver as is"". The side was crushed and there were water marks on all sides of the box. It wasn't raining here, I also got the TV as fed ex was leaving. It was a horrible experience. I returned it to the store with in an hour. I was very disappointed.",0
205,10/31/2023,The claim is that the item was delivered but I never got it. The delivery person allegedly left a brand new tv carelessly outside my door. Now it’s disappeared. Walmart have commenced investigations but I’m so traumatized by this experience. There’s a leasing office so why’d any right thinking person just claim to leave something so valuable and fragile so carelessly?,0
206,11/12/2023,"The TV was delivered LATE. There was no update with the tracking from 7AM until it was delivered late at nite around 9ish. So the TV had been on the truck that whooole time and was delivered BROKEN. It also was not in a concealed brown cardboard box it was just in the regular orange VIZIO box that you would see it in in the store. There should have been extra packaging.  It was left downstairs on the bottom floor and I am on the top floor, anyone cld have stolen the orange VIZIO 65 inch TV box that was left in plain site. Walmart is the worst.",0
207,11/9/2023,I can’t download many of the apps I use regularly so this really limits my use of this tv. The volume is horrible. There isn’t much difference between 48 and 88. When I do watch tv I have to keep the remote in my hand and I’m forever adjusting the volume.,0
208,11/21/2023,Item not received.  Item arrived at my local post office at 6:29 am on November 20th and the post office did not deliver.  Not surprised.  Had I known it was being shipped using the USPS I would never have ordered it.  I would have got it from AMAZON or BEST BUY.,0
209,12/4/2023,The television was broken when it arrived. I went to the local Wal-Mart store 0424 and was told that Wal-Mart couldn't give me another television because Wal-Mart do no longer do exchanges on anything but groceries without a receipt. After going online I discovered that Wal-Mart return policy had not changed.  Wal-Mart store 0424 need new front managers because they are rude and do not know what they are doing. I am very disappointed.,0

I cannot access any of the premium channels that I'm already paying for through xfinity comcast, cannot link with my wi-fi connection to use the internet. Tomorrow I'll go back to my 10 year old t.v. at least I can watch the channels I'm already paying for.",0
211,11/26/2023,Had to wait in pick-up kiosk to get this TV.   The box was damaged and I was hoping that wouldn't be an issue but IT WAS.   After hauling it home and going thru all the trouble of unpacking it sooooo carefully I found it already had a crack in it!    Walmart corporate or an employee possibly was obviously not careful enough with it and didn't care and dumped it on an unsuspecting customer.  NOT COOL.,0
212,11/10/2023,"tv had defective tuner so I cannot utilize the functions. service worked extensively for about 2 hours and said they will replace the tuner immediately. 
Next day they are requesting that I send back the tuner with full explanation but I still can't use the TV. Very, very dissatisfied with with Visio service.",0
213,12/7/2023,I would write a nice review but I did not receive the TV would you please look into it it was $269. If it all possible I would like it credited back to my credit card because I did not receive the package. I’m sorry I can’t afford to buy another one. Thank you in advance.,0
214,12/13/2023,"Do not allow delivery by Fed Ex.  The driver that delivered our package ignored delivery instructions actually causing him more work (carrying extra large clumbsy package up a flight of stairs) forcing us to now get help putting the package at the correct door, so we can actually get the package INTO the house!  No clue what our product is like, as we don't yet have it at a door where we can get it checked out and fully functional, by actually bringing it into the house.  Sorry Fed Ex but today's driver is so pressed for time, he didn't even check his delivery instructions.  And that is not on your over worked delivery personnel that should be receiving extra support at this time of year.  It is on the company that is supposed to be a suppo...",0

216,11/10/2023,"This was a sham.  I paid for it but never got it. The shipper was addressed to another address with a weight listed of 2.65 pound's signed for by someone with a different name and Walmart admitted that their partner had done this to others, and they no longer deal with them.",0
217,11/29/2023,I specifically asked for this to be delivered but it wasn't . Instead I had to have it refund but what upsets me even more is that I have to wait 10 days to receive my money back but it didn't take 10 minutes to take my money from my account. I tried to purchase online an ONN tv on the 25th. An hour after submitting my order and payment I received notification that it was SOLD OUT… it's the 29th and I'm still waiting on my refund of that money as well . Walmart has almost $700 of my money and I have no TV yet I'm still waiting for my money that didn't take 5 minutes to remove from my account. It sucks,0
218,11/21/2023,"So I ordered this tv through the Walmart  app and they shipped it to the wrong address!! Even though my receipt clearly has the right address and the postal office didn’t mess up either. Postal office said the seller put the wrong address, not me not the postal office but Walmart or who ever they have contracts with. Besides the fact that they sent the tv somewhere else, I couldn’t get the same deal to by the tv again because Walmart said since it was a third party company they can’t do anything but refund me. Yet a week later that tv went up $100 so had to get it for a more expensive price because Walmart doesn’t know how to do business or fulfill orders. Be careful when ordering online, they have companies from other places selling on the...",0

Well the TV was delivered to my home instead of the address I requested. Needless to say, it was seen so what was supposed to be a surprise, is not. I heard from nobody and am very disappointed in the customer service. I give one star not for the TV but for the lack of a response.",0
221,11/11/2023,We are so disappointed. We bought this tv in August 2023 and now in November 2023 it doesn't work. It freezes every single day. We have to unplug it and restart it multiple times a week. Of course there is only a 30 day return window so now we're stuck with a $500 tv that works when it wants to. We typically love our VIZIO tvs but this one is a lemon for sure.,0

I ordered the item and added my husband as an alternative pick up person and when he was there in a spot I checked him in. He waited in his car for a while before an employee came to his car and said he wasn't checked I and she said shechecked him in. He continued to wait for 2 hours for our single item. I tried to call the pickup phone multiple times and it rang and rang with no answer. He had our small daughter with him and we were eventually advised that we could leave and come back, but we are not able to do this the next few days due to our work schedules. It is completely unacceptable to make customers w...",0
224,12/24/2023,I ordered from here and said everything was available and I was charged my card. Come to find you it wasn’t available and I can’t even cancel my order to get my refund and I have to wait to get my money. I ordered and paid when it said the TV was available and an hour before I’m supposed to pick up I got a text saying my tv was no longer available but offered free shipping after Christmas. I tried to cancel my order asap and it won’t let me. I want my refund asap. I want confirmation that my order was cancelled and I can get my refund.,0

229,9/24/2022,The screen was cracked all the way up the front I went to Wal mart they said they couldn't do anything because it was over 30 days but the technician just came out today to hook it up and we pulled it out of the box together,0
230,8/20/2023,"Dont buy this tv,it dead after using it for a year,waste of money,the screen turned dark and red lines appears nothing else,broke than les than a year",0
231,7/1/2023,Just over 2 years old and the picture has lines everywhere; to the point that it’s aggravating to watch. I would recommend spending a little more money and getting a better quality and better warranty.,0
232,5/12/2023,"I never write reviews, this thing is a pile of junk! Less than a year and had green and yellow lines appearing through the middle of the screen. A few months later and now it flickers and flashes green, purple and yellow across the entire screen and is completely unwatchable! That's if you can even get the thing to even turn on from a completely blacked out screen! I wish I would have read all these 1 star reviews before purchase because it seems it's a common issue. What a waste of $300, hopefully this saves at least a few people from this garbage TV!",0

235,1/6/2024,"If you're watching a movie/TV show and there's a scene with no dialogue or background music, the sound will just cut out completely. It really takes you out of the movie and makes it hard to enjoy watching it. Apparently there's no way to fix it",0
236,1/1/2024,The TV malfunctions after ever show blinking in and out. It also mutes itself. Plus this TV is difficult to tune in. You have to make a lot of choices just to view regular channels. We are very dissatisfied with this brand .,0
237,1/20/2024,tv screen had a damage spot in corner of television screen. Didn't see it until everything was programed and connected.  It's a inconvenient to repackage and start over. So I paid full price for a damaged tv. I will not order electronic again.,0

242,6/29/2023,Smart cast sucks. The TV is super slow I don't recommend at all. Just get a Roku or Samsung. I don't see how it has so many good reviews. Can hardly watch tv without it going out and smart ast not working.. literally every time.,0
243,7/17/2023,I returned this television the next day after receiving it because it was the wrong model and I am having a terrible time getting my refund.

I doubt very much if I will ever use walmart.com again and I certainly won’t use FedEx.,0

245,7/29/2022,To had this tv for only 31 days and I turned it on and there are all vertical lines on50 % of the screen!  DO NOT BUY a Vizio!  It happened to my son as well!  I had Vizio for years and loved the brand but now 300 in the waste basket!  So truly disappointed!,0
246,7/27/2023,"First, the TV took two hours to set up.  It downloaded software or firmware five times.  Thence message appeared that the SmartCast was unavailable.  There is no home screen showing available apps.  The color was washed out, and none of the available settings would correct the issue.  The time was wrong, and there was no way to correct it.  Overall, this Vizio TV was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.  I have two older models that have much better pictures and features than this one.  I guess you really do get what you pay for.  I didn't pay very much, and I certainly didn't get very much.",0
247,8/5/2023,The tv didnt load any apps since I opened it up. spent 3 hours on the phone with hulu alone only to find out it was the tv. I always swore by the Vizio brand by not anymore. Went with a Tcl Roku 55 inch and I love it the color is better the ease of use is better and it was even cheaper.,0
248,6/7/2021,"We were very optimistic about our purchase given the quality of all of our other VIZIO TVs we own.  Boy were we wrong.  As soon as we plugged in the tv and turned it on, we were going through the initial setup and it would not connect to our wifi.  We did all of the trouble shooting, as the tv showed it was connected to our wifi with strong signal strength but it showed a failure message.  After rebooting our router a few times, trying to start over with the set up, we were able to somehow get it to connect.  The tv then searched for updates, tv shut off, when it rebooted it gave us an error message it was not able to complete update.  If we then hit cancel, we could bypass and actually start to watch tv.  Once you turned it off and back on...",0
249,10/23/2023,"Had to get another tv due to my 1st HD Tv pic going out, and had the BEST picture quality (for a older tv-720p). This 4k is the worst out of the 5 tvs I have.

250,9/10/2023,"Woke up this morning to a dead tv in my living room so I thought this would fit the bill… nope. Everything was fine… picture quality, fine. Audio quality, fine. The inability to delete the pre installed  apps or organize your Home Screen… nope. I’m returning this for a monitor, I don’t need to pay a company to try and feed me ads let alone give them space in my living room. We set the tv up and spent 1hr with it and we’re packing it back up and returning it, worst purchase this year.",0
251,7/7/2023,"My tv did not come with the power cord, legs or remote. I'm being told 5-7 business days before I will receive the items that should have been in the box. The manufacturer is putting it on Walmart and Walmart is putting it on the manufacturer. They are shifting the blame and will not expedite items within 24 hours. When I called Walmart's customer service I was told that I had to buy the missing items!!! Totally unacceptable and as a long time customer with  Walmart I'm very disappointed and will not be shopping at Walmart ever again!!!!",0

255,3/17/2023,"Got this installed and from day one I've had nothing but trouble with it, constantly having to factory reset as well as unplugging it. finally had to get factory technician in here and I replaced the main board, and it's been working okay since then. but now it's got lines in the picture, and getting hold of support is almost impossible. I will never buy another Vizio again after this experience.",0
256,6/28/2023,even when plugged directly into a router with consistent 300mbps this tv only gets 8mbps. content either constantly buffers or has severe quality drops. this is with it plugged directly into the ethernet port. the tv does not give you control over any of the options or anything standard in a 4k tv.,0
257,8/23/2023,I ordered online and picked up at the store. I set everything and as soon as I turned it on. It was cracked from one end to the middle of the screen. I returned back to the store within 30 minutes. I was told since I bought it online that I couldn't do an exchange. The TV had to be refunded. This was a big inconvenience!!,0
258,8/2/2021,"None of the apps work! Please see picture. Okay picture quality, but horrible tv. I usually buy Samsung, but decided to give this one a try. Big mistake! This tv was functional for 2 days at best and then all the apps crashed. We tried everything to get it to work and nothing. So disappointing! I'm returning this.",0
259,8/3/2023,I don't like to fact that your can't download certain apps. You can only have the apps that's installed on the tv or use your phone to connect. Readjusting the volume and setting the tv colors shows okay but the volume is horrible. I have to turn my television up to at least 50/60 to hear in the area.,0
260,9/7/2023,"I specifically bought this tv for the HDMI 2.1 ability to replace my previous 55"" tv that did not. Which in the description %26 specs on this page it states numerous times that this tv has a HDMI 2.1 input. Well, that is false. There is no HDMI 2.1 port on the tv. So, essentially I bought this tv for no reason. Waste of money and false advertising.",0
261,10/5/2023,"Right out of the box, the tv did not work. I called tech support and after an hour of trying all different things. Plug it in and ply it out. Restart. Reboot. Unplug the internet and plug it back in. Move the router. Finally they tech said that I needed a repair person to come out and fix the brand new tv. So, I'm waiting for a call. 
Not off to a great start. 
Tech was very good though and so was the young man who helped me to maneuver the tv into my car. Great service from both.",0
262,10/17/2023,Absolutely horrendous! Item arrived with a shattered screen. Made contact with someone who was completely unable to figure out how to offer me an exchange. The label that was apparently created for me to ship item back is not available on the like. Simply states “sorry”. I merely want to exchange my damaged product for one that isn't. How can this be such an issue?,0
263,9/10/2023,this is the bigest pice of crap you turn it on and you have to go to antena and wate for it to finaly find a chanel and it takes forever to work i put this junk in the garage where it might get used once a year maby this will be the last vizio ill ever but what a disapointment,0
264,5/21/2021,So I bought this TV Monday night 5-17-21 I started to use it the next day and it froze on me 4 times on the first day of use the only way to get it to work was to unplug it has done the same thing every day with a blank screen then it started going to a fuzzy screen on 2 day so I'm taking it back and getting my money back crazy cause I have another vizio tv that I've had since 2013 never had not 1 issue with it but this thing is garbage.,0
265,9/4/2023,"Did not work.  I suspect it was a store demo, and they were passing it off as new because it was beautifully repackaged and looked totally unopened—except there was no protective film over the screen. When they repackaged it after the demo, they put it back into the WRONG carton—so the serial numbers didn’t match and they didn’t want to give me my refund.  Caveat emptor:  MAKE THEM OPEN THE BOX there before you leave the store and compare serial numbers or you may have wasted hundreds of dollars because wal mart won’t properly train their people!!   The store manager was instructing everyone as I got my refund that if the numbers don’t match going forward THERE WILL BE NO REFUNDS ISSUED.  Well,  too bad for us honest citizens—we get done ov...",0

I'm continuously having to restart the tv 3-4 times to finally get it connected sometimes it doesn't connect.  I have even factory reset the tv.

267,9/12/2023,I ordered a tv to be delivered to my home. Delivery stated that it was delivered. We didn't get the tv. This was on the 09-05-2023. I have been contacting Walmart everyday since and have only been put to another person and repeatedly been put on hold for over 90 minutes each time. No answer from them yet. So beware if you order doesn't come. Try to get a refund. ☹️,0
268,10/15/2023,Its been leas than 4 months that i made this purchase and now Tv screen freezes. I called customer service and they said i only had 30 dys for warranty. I spend a large amount of money only  to not be able to use my TV. Customer service was of no help to assist in this issue. I am dissatisfied and disappointed in the lack of assistance to help in my matter.,0
269,8/17/2023,I know it's probably not your fault but I just ordered this and Ned today it comes broken I was so mad I immediately boxed it up quicker than I could even think of taking a picture to show you guys.

270,9/6/2023,arrived with bottom of box missing. If i hadnt been outside with delivery driver the TV would have fell out of box. no straping either. it was saved but question if it was a floor model or returned at some point. will update once tv is installed to check it out,0

We still have not received the replacement and they have thus far refused to refund our purchase price instead of the replacement.  We will never buy another Vizio anything!!!",0

After spending nearly a whole day troubleshooting it as well as talking with Vizio customer support we agreed the tv couldnt be fixed. According to the Vizio CSR the firmware was outdated and the tv was not connecting to the Vizio servers to update the tv and all the apps. The WatchFree LIVE tv was 3hrs behind the real time on the tv and could NOT be fixed. Also, when i tried to watch anything on Amazon, Hulu, Pluto tv or any other similar app the tv showed error messages that it couldn't be played.

382,5/21/2023,"TV refused to connect to the app, didn't log into streaming services, was a nightmare - Spent 2 hours with Vizio customer service and then they disconnected me and sent me to a new rep. That was after telling my me to change settings on my phone and download other apps. ridiculous. Not very smart, imo. I'd rather have a tube tv in black %26 white. Exchanged it for a hisense Roku tv and set up took maybe 2 minutes, everything logged in immediately, app works, and I can stream from phone and other devices. This Vizio tv wouldn't do ANY of that! useless.",0

385,5/18/2023,I've had my tv for four months and with no warning the tv blinked out and turned back in again only to stay on the black screen that says VIZIO. It won't switch to the app screen and it won't turn off unless I completely unplug it. I tried all the suggested troubleshooting and nothing worked. Total garbage. I had to give it one star to submit this review. It deserves a zero star rating.,0

I have taken it back to factory settings several times but it doesn’t help, I believe this TV is a lemon.  I wrote to Vizio and a representative called me and said they don’t give replacements or money back.  I only gave it one star because this app requires something.  It’s actually zero stars to me.",0

Vizio said a tech has to come into our home to install a piece in the TVs to make Netflix work. Needless to say, they're just being returned! All apps worked but the main app that we would be using was Netflix, if we had known this we wouldn't have purchased!",0
390,6/8/2023,"Beware - this TV has so many apps uploaded to it (that you cannot delete or change) that it runs VERY slow - even after taking it off ECO mode. We searched/tried both VIZIO's site and the internet for instructions on how to make this TV work. We couldn't get any content to play from normal apps like Prime, Hulu or Apple after we signed in to those accounts on the TV.  We couldn't even get past the Netflix screen to sign in to it. We also could not get the chromecast that is supposedly already on the TV to work. It's too bad because we liked the size and the picture quality of the TV, however it's operating system clearly limits its performance. It took HOURS to setup. We had to reset it multiple times and it still did not work. We even let ...",0

392,5/5/2023,"This is not a technical review of this television, more of a complaint. I'm hoping it will eventually turn out to be a good TV. But there is a major caveat that any potential buyer should be aware of.

The VOC odor of this TV is the strongest of any piece of electronics I've even encountered. As soon as I unpacked it, every one of my family members commented on the awful smell. Within a few minutes, two family members complained of headaches.

I moved it out to my garage. I kept the garage door open during the day to help with the ventilation. The last two days, I've brought it out to my patio in hopes that the sun plus the outdoor breeze would help accelerate the off-gassing. It has not helped.

Purchased and right out of the box the Apple Airplay %26 screen mirror wouldn't work.  Spent about an hour trouble shooting on our own and over 1 1/2 hours on phone with Vizio support.  The firmware was not updated, so all the features do not work, and the TV would not manually update the firmware by factory reset, manual update or via a process that was a pain using a thumb drive.  Essentially this meant these features are not available and TV would always be out of date.  Vizio advised me that they would not send a replacement since som...",0

Picked this one out because vizio had better reviews along with it was more expensive so gave it a try. Regret my decision and wish i stuck with the other cheaper TCL roku models or something else. Its missing crunchy roll as well which is weird it has funimation that was bought out by crunchy roll.

396,5/11/2023,Going to see how good or poor the Vizio customer service is.  The return window is 30 days.  I have had the TV 34 days.  All of a sudden I now have a vertical and horizontal line running across the screen.  No storms.  No power surges.  And even if that was the case I have it on a very good surge protector.  I'm so disappointed.  But we shall see what the process is with service or replacement.,0

0,11/28/2023,"My last Vizio tv was a 37 inch I think. It was almost 20 years old and still working good. I decided on an upgrade. The price of flatscreens has come down over the years and you can buy a much larger screen with more features for less money than 20 years ago. This 50 inch is a smart 4K with chromecast built in. It was $248 which is about $200 less than what I paid for the 37 inch.
I have streaming apps on my phone and iPad and I can select a movie and start it on my tv. Also have the same apps on the tv but I think being able to do it with my phone or iPad is easier and faster.
I could have gone bigger but I think this is plenty big. When I was younger we had a 13 inch BW tv and no cable. 
I think anyone would be happy with this tv",1
1,11/27/2023,"I purchased the 65” Vizio 4K TV In part on the strength of good reviews but a sale price of just under $400 pushed me over the edge. I use a Firestick most of the time so I didn't care too much about the TV's build in OS, but I found that it's actually pretty decent and offers a nice array of alternative content. 

I replaced a 48 inch 1080p LG and the difference is remarkable. I would definitely buy another one.",1
2,9/26/2023,This Vizio 4K UHD is easy to setup may take some time updating as you get connected with internet. I would recommend this beauty too anyone and everyone who enjoys a quality product with clear high definition and quality image. So amazed at how great this quality flat screen is for the fair price.,1
3,9/8/2023,"Love the size, the clarity and the sound…..amazing!! Make sure your current tv stand is large enough for this to sit on top of, had to purchase a new one for this set. Plenty of apps (but not abc) to enjoy hours of entertainment, minimalist remote control and after purchasing (hopefully you catch it on sale) you can enter a sweepstakes for a Vizio sound bar which in my opinion isn't necessary because the sound is robust as is but who's turning down the opportunity for a free useful electronic 😏",1
4,9/10/2023,"Great TV, picture is great, not a fan of the legs, not as sturdy as I like, this was an upgrade in size from a 43’ Vizio D, to a 50’ Vizio V, crisp, clear picture. To solve the leg issue, I bought on Amazon a center TV stand. I’m sure once I have it put on, I’ll feel better.",1
5,7/9/2023,"Really outstanding performance, I've had one other Vizio in my life and it's probably 10 years old and still performs great. I basically use m Vizio for Gaming on my PS5 or watching football. So far I have no complaints at all, would highly recommend",1
6,10/11/2023,Great picture love different settings we like the vivid picture setting. we also like the fact that the soundbar sounds great too. normal sound is good too weight is good also setup was a breeze make sure you download the app first thing also adding my other accounts is easy too very happy and will buy again if ever need one.,1
7,11/16/2023,"TV is very sturdy. It has some weight to it, but rather easy to mount. Graphics are above what I expected for its prize. The VIZIO user interface looks a lot better than most other TVs and is put together quite well. The TV is very responsive to remote commands and inputs. I don't find myself using the microphone commands on the remote, but it capable. Definitely a great deal and worth the purchase.",1
8,11/5/2023,I liked the updates and the map showing where the driver was. It gave me a sense of how close they were to actually delivering. The Walmart app also showed the expected time of delivery and how many deliveries the driver had before me. This was our first time having something delivered from the store. A picture was taken and sent to us in the app saying it was delivered but they meet us at the door to make sure we received the item in hand.,1
9,10/8/2023,"I like ho light in weight. The picture gives an in the theater type of mood. Although I like the Roku products, it's nice to have a product not dependent on third party devices to get the best results. That's what this product does for me.",1
10,8/22/2023,"Great product, I've always loved Vizio products and this one most certainly did not disappoint!!
Amazing picture, works great with the sound bar, and gaming on it is insane!!
Definitely would recommend especially for the price.",1
11,9/22/2023,Amazing TV and  great price! Im so happy with my purchase. This is my 3rd Vizio television and they are really great! The picture is amazing. They are very easy to set up also.,1
12,1/14/2024,"This 50in Vizio smart tv is a great choice if you're looking for a new smart tv.The picture is beautiful and the operating system is smooth and easy to navigate even for a person that isn't familiar with smart televisions.I ordered it on a Thursday and received it on Friday before 1pm,very fast and it is easy to setup. The only thing I suggest is to setup a soundbar if you're planning on watching movies, sports etc,that really is normal with mostly all smart tvs as they aren't great with volume issues.It arrived in perfect condition. I would definitely recommend this tv for the price point.",1
13,11/14/2023,"Once having a Google screen, and inspired by family to change to Vizio, I have no regrets! The wider screen, the border is so small that it makes it looks almost like Waterfall edges🤣 GREAT TV AND UUSER FRIENDLY 🥰",1
14,3/15/2023,Easy to buy. Easy to load. Easy to mount. It's much lighter than my old Vizio. It also lets me stream Fubo . Which saves me 110.00 a month over my Direct TV.,1
15,3/13/2023,Love the new added features they have available. Voice remote. Headset although I don’t know how to connect the head set yet  everything else works great color sound great,1
16,2/11/2024,Perfect TV and size. Was supposed to come on Saturday but was so excited that it came early Sunday morning! Easy unboxing and set up. Just need a TV stand and we're all set!,1
17,11/18/2023,What sold me on this tv was the Bluetooth headphones connection compatibility. I am a super early riser in the mornings. I love being able to put my AirPods in and watch tv with out disturbing my husband. The voice control remote is awesome to take you right to the app you want to stream on. So happy with my purchase. I’ve had it for 2 weeks so far with zero issues. The sound isn’t as loud as my old tv so I am thinking of purchasing a sound bar for it. Not an issue for me though. Still over the moon with this tv!,1
18,11/12/2023,If you're looking for a great quality easy setup picture and sound perfect tv that doesn't break your pocket This Vizio is the one ! We replaced it from our last one which lasted us many long years. Our relatives %26 friends have other well name brands that haven't held up like this brand . Honestly I never take time nor honestly have time to leave reviews however I feel this will help others who are struggling to find a good tv. For them or as a gift,1
19,1/26/2024,"With 4K resolution, it really stands out if you want to make a statement in any room. One of the best features for me was that they included Bluetooth connectivity to any headphones, so if you wanna blast that movie at night by all means. It also syncs with your PS5 and your fire stick TV so you don’t need so one remote.",1
20,5/17/2021,"Good size at 55 inches and easy set up, it walks you through everything.
It has tons of free show, movies, etc and apps. It also has it's own free
Tv app that has tons of stuff too. Really easy to navigate anywhere with
in the tv and all the options it has. Remote control is sleek and very easy
to use. I love the voice search. It's so easy. I like that at top of remote
it has Tubi, crackle, Netflix and 3 others, but wish one was programmable
to the app I use most instead of what they preselected. The tv is really
very nice and has vivid, clean and beautiful color on all pictures. Volume
is good but muted do to speakers being in the back of tv instead of
on sides or front, because it's mounted on my wall the volume isn't
as loud as...",1

I was in complete awe watching a nature show. The rest of the TV is just as impressive. The box has simple instructions on it for set up and installation plus there are instructions inside. Setting up was a breeze. The home page has all the most popular apps already pre-installed and all you have to do is log in. Connecting to wifi was quick and easy as well. My home wifi immediately popped up on the scan list and I was connected in less than a minute. The connection was fast! The voice remote is an added bonus and actually understands what you are asking for. The r...",1
22,5/8/2021,"I was so happy when this arrived unbroken. I have had that issue in the past with big screen tvs. It did however not have a power cord. I was able to use our cord from TV that we had. The colors are Amazing! The sound quality is AwEsOmE! When the kids play their games its as of you are IN the game. Perfect for family room. What a gift this would be for a wedding, housewarming, or just an upgrade. You will not be disappointed.",1
23,5/7/2021,"This is not a TV, it is an experience. I have another major brand that is two years old and the difference in the picture quality and features from it to this TV is no less than amazing. We don't have reliable internet in our rural area so I can't use the smart cast or other features. I connect it to DIRECTV and the features are fantastic. The colors and detail are unbelievable. It is not easy to connect and program but once it is up and going it is worth the effort. The sound could be better, I have it connected to a sound bar so that is not a problem. I use closed captioning most of the time and due to the size of the viewing area the captioning is not so distracting to other viewers. I would also like to see several more USB and HDML out...",1
24,5/10/2021,"This review will not feature all the intricacies of this TV but rather the mom perspective. If you are looking for an amazing TV that works great, has a ton of new features then this TV is for you. It is a great size perfect for any room. Super easy to set up. I was able to walk through the set up steps quickly and with ease. Nothing too complicated for set up which was super nice. 

The quality of the TV and what if offers is simply amazing. My previous TV wasn't that old (less than five years) but WOW the upgrade is so worth it! I love the build in apps such as Amazon, Netflix, Disney, Apple TV (that's correct no more separate Apple TV needed. So easy to pair with your Apple devices for screen mirroring. I mean so easy!), you tube, Peac...",1

26,5/7/2021,"This smart television is a cord cutters dream come true! Even if you do not subscribe to streaming services, this tv has tons of movies and shows to watch for free. It is jam packed with apps for the entire family. These apps have every category imaginable for me to watch. From my favorite crime shows, live news channels, cooking shows, workout videos, sitcoms, etc. If you can imagine it, it is there. I played with this for over an hour and probably didn't even get through a small fraction of the items on this TV set. It has free channels such as Tubi, YouTube, Peacock, Pluto Tv, Newsy, PBS Kids, KidDoodle TV, Crackle, FaceBook Watch, The CW and so much more. Vizio also has its own app called Vizio Watch where I can stream tons of channels ...",1
27,5/18/2021,"This Vizio 55"" Smart TV is absolutely amazing for the price! It is 4K Ultra HD which makes a huge difference on the sharpness and the sound quality is actually much better than I expected. It is incredible how much the 55"" size makes a difference in everyone's enjoyment of the programs we watch! Visio has something called SmartCast that enables quick access to many common services like Roku, Netflix, Disney+, and it also has AirPlay and Chromcast built in. Because services like these are integrated, setting it up was a breeze and there was no need to attach accessories like a Roku stick, saving a little money. Like many electronics, there is a Quick Start Guide and no user manual so prepare to access that online if needed, however the most ...",1

It was surprisingly lighter than I had expected but extremely well made and sturdy. It also comes with a remote control that needs to be paired, easy as 123. The picture quality is amazing! It is not too light, not too shaded, just right. The fluidity of the refresh rate was smooth.

If you are a gamer this is a great 2021 Vizio 50inch upgrade for PS5 console PS4Pro gaming experience!  I use the headset for gaming and Dolby sounds greatness with headset ears for awesome graphics with no lagging HDR.

Great picture %26 great sound. You can see pores and hear breathing. What more do you need?

Yes 4K and Smart TV! The TV was delivered earlier than expected. I am not sure what to think about the legs, maybe they need to be a little more sturdy. Overall great TV and I purchased it for a great price!",1
122,4/7/2022,"This 70"" Vizio Smart Tv is everything I hoped it would be. Giant clear screen! The price was just right. I used my Sams Bonus Rewards for most of it!

140,8/10/2022,"Nice tv, works great, very light, easy to set up.",1
141,1/8/2024,"I bought this TV on Black Friday 2022 for $399. I wanted it for my Xbox Series X because it does have HDMI 2.1 support, but the panel isn't true 120hz. It supports Dolby Vision and HDR10, with AMD Freesync as well. The low latency makes it greay for gaming. I'd definitely recommend this TV. I've used it over a year now and have no complaints. The Vizio interface took a little getting used to switching from Roku. I'd recommend this TV to anyone looking for a great gaming TV.",1
142,7/18/2023,I like the size of the tv on my wall. I see alot of negative comments about this tv picture quality and/or sound. Well I recommend you buy a 4k streaming device like I have. I don't watch my tv without it. Plus I have a Vizio 5.1 soundbar for my sound. Haven't had any problems yet🤞🏾 I highly recommend those items and you will enjoy your tv.,1
143,8/6/2023,I'm very pleased with my Vizio TV for our family room.,1
144,7/14/2023,Amazing price for a perfect reliable smart tv,1

151,8/19/2023,The tv arrived in perfect condition!,1
152,8/8/2023,Love it! I wish it displayed the time and local weather on the display/Home Screen.,1
153,8/11/2023,Great awesome increíble tv love,1
154,7/29/2023,Great TV. We can now cast from our phones. We also no longer need the cable box.,1
155,1/7/2024,"Great picture with setting adjustments that matter. Easy to set up and start using with an app for my phone. All the little things that I was looking for - sleep timer, bluetoooth so I can connect headphones, easy to navigate menus so my kids don’t need help. Great purchase. Vizio never disappoints!",1
156,6/9/2023,I was a little concerned about mounting the tv because of the size of the tv but it worked out perfectly. No issues. Absolutely love it.,1
157,6/9/2023,I really love my new TV the size is perfect for my living room Walmart was very prompt on their delivery and had a good price. Very happy thank you!,1
158,1/18/2022,This television is an exceptionally good deal. I also use it as a computer monitor. No more squinting to read the print. The picture clarity and definition is incredible.,1
159,1/31/2024,"For less than $250 who could ask for anything more.
I have owned a couple Roku TVs in the past and I've always thought they were the best for the money. 
This smart TV blows them away.",1
160,1/27/2024,"I can’t find anything negative to say. The price was right; (my tv was destroyed in my recent move) I barely could afford this. Never did I think that the picture could or would be so vivid and crisp. The live image is better than on the ad. A lot better. The sound is immersive and intense. 
Set-up is straight forward. I think it took less than an hour from start to finish.  I’m only using WiFi and have tons of channels. 
The remote is simple and actually unnecessary. You can download an app to your phone to do everything you want or need. Either way, you can access voice remote and end hunting for shows once and for all. 
This is an exceptional TV at any cost!",1
161,1/31/2024,This was a great purchase! All of our televisions are Vizio. They are always very reliable and last a very long time. This particular TV was on sale so we thought we would purchase it for a guest room. We recently got rid of cable and needed the technology so that we could stream our favorite channels. The set-up was quick and easy.,1
162,2/2/2024,"You can’t go wrong with the Vizio Brand, it is plug and play easy. Walmart delivery brought it into my living room for me, my son helped me take it out of the box, he plugged in the HDMI cords, I turned it on, it connected to the internet automatically, updated its software, and VOILA I was watching local TV, satellite, Apple TV, Free TV, YouTube, Hulu, etc… Vizio TV’s truly are plug %26 play! Walmart delivery as always exceeds expectations!",1
163,4/16/2023,I love the tv.,1
164,2/11/2024,"I absolutely LOVE my new Smart TV from Vizio!!!!!!  The colors are bright and vibrant!  The set up was a piece of cake.  The only drawback I would mention is the Remote Control that came with the TV.  The remote requires the use of two remotes.  The Vizio Remote controls the Volume while the primary Cable Remote volume buttons no longer functions.  I tried tying the two remotes should be activated by three digit key codes.  But it doesn't which is unfortunate.  However, the TV is great!!!!!",1
165,6/3/2023,Looks so nice,1
166,1/24/2024,"The TV fit exactly where I wanted it to with a little push...the measurements where right on but I didn't allow for the ""feet""....my bad!  The set up was sooooo easy and it synced with my other wi-fi gadgets without me having to do inputting on them.",1
167,1/25/2024,"Incredibly easy set up.  Extremely well packaged, and easy to unpack (cut the straps and slide the box up) Fantastic picture out of the box, no playing with brightness and color settings.  Get a sound bar or surround sound system unless you use only closed captions.",1
168,6/11/2023,I love the tv so clear,1
169,2/11/2024,"I love this tv so much the Vizio has been my favorite TELEVISION from my teenage years till an adult, it’s help me through college and  when I got my first house always reliable had my first Vizio for ten year before I got this one and it wasn’t because it broke I just need something new for the new crib, but the thing that I love about this smart tv is the free streaming that saves me so much on cable and satellite bills, bunch of good channels different from the norm but interesting stuff being shown good select of movies too and all the apps you would ever need for your tv ! And did I tell you how much I save on cable bills? I don’t have one ! Free streaming is the way of the future Vizios becomes the Best family television in my opinion...",1
170,2/8/2024,the visio tv has all the bells i need 43 inch fits in my apartment just fine providing good vidual acuity connections with internet were easy and I  like easy remote control with multiple sites accessible from the remote buttons one touch.I could have gotten a bigger tv but this one is perfect for me. grandpa john.,1
171,2/14/2024,"I needed a larger TV for my living room as i have a long high wall. The 40"" just didn't cut it. This is perfect with the tv/entertainment stand I bought!
I couldn't afford a Samsung or higher cost tv. Vizio's a great in-between and I'm super happy with it and the 40"" in my bedroom!",1
172,1/25/2024,Works very well...Just a little problem connecting WiFi.  Once this is activated the push to talk microphone  becomes available .  I was amassed just how accurate  the voice recognition works.  My only challenge is to try to remove all the unwanted channels and streaming garbage that populated the antenna input during setup.  Very pleased and at a great price.,1
173,5/13/2023,The price was awesome,1
174,5/24/2023,Love this Vizio nice Tv,1
175,1/28/2024,I love the size! Also how easy it was to take out the box and just plug it in. I love the picture and the sound. Beautiful Surrounded sound as well And the colors on the picture This was a great Vibe And it also connects to all of Bar speakers And Dvd player,1
176,5/8/2023,Love it,1
177,2/16/2024,"Shopping through choices was EZ on Wal-mart app. Picked this Vizio 65"" and it provides a crisp picture and wall mounting was simple. First TV was too small (55) so we easily exchanged and put 65 inch on the bedroom wall in a 19 ft long bedroom.

TV has bright screen even on days when Florida sun is pouring through 4 sliding glass doors.",1
178,2/12/2024,"Got this TV after our rokus backlight went out. We’ve had it for about a month now and it’s been great with the quality of the visuals and audio. I appreciate the free channels that came with it too. The only thing I wish is that we could download Crunchyroll or Dropout since those are our main streaming services, but understand that it may be a bit niche. All things considered I’m really happy with it, at a great price no less!",1
179,2/1/2024,"""The tv remote is the only thing i have to complain about!  ""It's very cheaply made %26 i can't change the channels like most normal tv remotes can do, with an up %26 down button option on the remote!!  ""But other than that this Vizio brand ""50- inch color tv is fantastic with great color!!",1
180,1/4/2024,"I just got the TV and it has a nice picture quality. TV speakers are good, I hooked up my 2018 Vizio surround speakers and the sound never sounded this.",1
181,3/9/2023,"This is actually my third Vizio in this series... I bought a 32-inch a few years ago that required a chromecast dongle, and a 50 inch last year for the foot of my king bed.  Both were  good, but I wanted to use my headset to get high quality and reduce background noice, plus the voice command feature helps with my bad eyesight and memory... this is the perfect set for the bedridden.  It was quite an undertaking to set it up and go through the registration for youtube, youtube tv and Prime again, but Everything went without a hitch.  Pure luxury for me and highly recommended.  I bought this via curbside and didn't even have to get ut of the truck to pick it up... not heavy, a little difficult to unbox, but well worth the effort.",1
182,5/19/2023,Very pleased with this 65 inch TV.. picture is gorgeous and love the way it looks on my fireplace.,1
183,1/3/2024,"I was looking to upgrade my wifes TV in the room from a 40"" Zenith to a smart TV and found this Visio at a great Black Friday price, now she has all new channels and apps to chose from not to mention the visual quality of the Visio by far an excellent choice.",1
184,12/28/2023,The picture is really detailed is one of the few tvs I've looked at that has av cable plugins for older devices and also has free live tv with some pretty decent channels. It also has 3 hdmi ports one is EARC. This tv is easily worth the amount you pay for it.,1
185,1/19/2024,"I am very pleased with my new 65” Vizio TV. It was easy to unpack and set up.  It was nice to have an “extra set of hands” because the size of the TV makes it a bit cumbersome (not heavy-just awkward).  This is my 3rd Vizio TV.  I used to be a fan of Samsung TVs but I find Vizio makes at least as good a TV but often priced for less.  In fact, I was stunned by the $398 price for this set. I mean this is a 65 inch Ultra High Definition set capable of 4k.  It seems I see similar TVs by other manufacturers for $1,000 or higher at other stores. 
It has a great picture, nice remote and connected nicely to a Vizio sound bar I also bought. It connected very easily to our WiFi and recognized the other Vizio system in the house.",1
186,1/13/2024,"The color of the picture is amazing for the price. It's no QLED but pretty good. Wide selection of apps available. I was also surprised how much content was available on Vizio ""Watch free "". The speakers are not great, just like with any other TV anymore...I already had a Vizio sound bar and the tv remote worked with the soundbar with no setup.",1
187,12/30/2023,I spontaneously bought this tv after my Hisense died after 2 yrs. This tv has surpassed my old Hisenae so far. The picture clarity is excellent. The sound goes as high as 100 but we keep it on 35   are able to hear clearly.  I love that Vizio offers their free channels. I hope it lasts longer than 2 yrs. This is a winner.,1
188,1/21/2024,"My 47"" VISIO of 13 yrs just would not die,.. But I finally got the go ahead and upgrade anyway to this 55"" .  It has the ARC I wanted to seamlessly work with sound bar using ARC. Love everything about this TV so I will list minor downside. Did not come with printed manual which I like to have in front of me when setting up.  I found everything I wanted through trial and error. Only other downside for me is that it does not have option to choose a different screen size for a given input as my last one did. My older DVR requires that the screen be stretched. Also remote does not have ""previous"" button or ""number digits"" so for a few bucks bought another remote on Amz that does have those. So one remote for me and one for my wife. win win.",1
189,1/3/2024,I've been buying Vizio T.V's for many years. I won't buy anything else. My 10 yr. old tv still works like a charm. The current tv i just bought was a Christmas gift for my son and he loves it. I HIGHLY recommend Vizio for tv purchases. You won't be sorry!!,1
190,12/26/2023,10/10 with easy 10-15 min install.  This is the third Vizio in my household.  Streaming is really easy anyone can do it. The voice remote is a great addition.  The picture quality is great and putting the tv legs on is easy as well.  This is exactly as described and are long lasting tvs.,1
191,12/28/2023,After owning a LG product and seeing that customer service after the purchase almost doesn't exist and since purchasing a Visio and getting immediate action being taken to solve the issue and after a year later they replaced the television with a brand new one,1
192,1/19/2024,"I love it and the guy mounted it so easily and quickly I was more than happy to pay for that extra service! I have a 50 inch Vizio that I have had for over 10 years and it is still going strong, I just wanted a bigger one. They are well worth the money!",1
193,1/15/2024,"I like the fact that I can cast to the TV from my cell phone or from my tablet. The picture is great the sound is good, and it is Friendly.  The only problem was that it was a little difficult to remove from the box. You really need two people if you get a 60 inch TV like I got.",1
194,1/17/2024,"I regret ever stepping away from Vizio. Coming back to the brand and i find i have clarity, speed, and awesome grphics. Only small issue is the strength of the speakers, but i feel thats be cause they aim downward rather than out front. Once wall mounted, everything changes for the better though.",1
195,1/16/2024,"Was a bit worried about this being shipped, but no issues at all. Love the TV. Setup was extremely easy. Supports a crazy amount of apps. Voice commands a huge plus. Remote is so simple. Great picture. Tons of settings to play with. Super happy with the purchase.",1
196,1/1/2024,"This is a great TV and especially for it's low price.  I purchased a VIZIO TV 16 years ago and it still has a perfect picture and of great quality.  I remember when the cable tech came for installation...his words were...""WOW...I see a lot of TV's and this is the 'best' picture I've ever seen!  He was right and it still has the 'best' picture!  There are many settings to adjust the TV to your liking.  Very happy that I purchased another ""VIZIO"".",1
197,9/5/2023,"I am a couple of months into the purchase, and I still absolutely love it. Sharp, clear, beautiful picture. It comes up right away when you switch the power on. It was super easy to connect to my sound bar, and all of the Settings are easy to adjust. This was a replacement for another brand that I thought I wanted… I have a Vizio in my bedroom, that used to be in the living room, but I wanted to go larger. I bought another brand that starts with the letter L and its other letter is G, and it was an absolute nightmare of a television. Antiquated tech, fuzzy picture, and everything on NBC had the audio delayed. I was using YouTube TV, and couldn't watch anything on NBC. When I got the Vizio, straight out of the box, it was/is perfect. I will ...",1
198,7/18/2023,"This TV is fantastic! It was so easy to set up, the tutorials walked through each of the steps and we had all of our streaming video accounts up and running within 30 minutes. The quality is fantastic, and what a great price!

Additionally, we originally set up shipping, which would have taken 3 days. We were pleasantly surprised when our local Walmart called and delivered the TV at no additional charge less than 24 hours later.",1
199,8/29/2021,It's a perfect size and not heavy at all. Love how I just connect it to wifi with no extra cords or anything going on,1

201,11/6/2023,Love this TV. Great picture and easy to set up all of the smart features. I had a prior TV in this same model that broke after a year and Vizio was amazing at replacing it.,1
202,1/29/2024,This great so far. But when I was buying this though PayPal someone use my account n bought something for$309.37 at the same time. So beware of your accounts,1
203,1/23/2024,The TV performs exactly as described. I like the screen size and screen clarity is great. The remote is easy to understand and work and the screen is a perfect size.,1
204,1/31/2024,Has lots of great apps. I can connect Bluetooth headphones when I don't want to wake up anyone but still watch TV. This TV replaced my 10 yr old vizio so I've had a good experience with this brand.,1
205,2/8/2024,Ordering on line was easy and the tv was delivered the next day. The picture on the screen is so much better than my old 43 inch tv. The tv has many other options for streaming. This is a great tv for the price.,1
206,1/29/2024,I already have one like this in my  den and have enjoyed it.  I bought this one for my grandson for Christmas for his first home and he loves it.  I would highly recommend it.,1
207,1/25/2024,Purchased this TV back in August and as of now everything works great and looks very clear. The television is mainly used for gaming. It is connected to my PS5 and looks good.,1
208,2/5/2024,this is an excellent TV for the price I hesitated buying but because of all the positive reviews I have been reading about this TV I decided to give it a try and I do not regret my decision it is a beautiful TV,1
209,1/22/2024,"This is by far the most beautiful Vizio I have ever owned. I started using only this brand about 8 years ago. Have never yet been disappointed. And this seller is right on the money timewise, information, great person to do business with.",1
210,1/28/2024,"I love my big TV.  Its working just fine.  I  prefer Vizio.   My previous TV was Vizio.  It was still working,  gave it to my daughter.   It is over years old.    can't go wrong yrusting a Vizio!   The cost was amazing!",1
211,2/5/2024,"Good product so far. Only complaint was the set up process took way too long. It wanted to scan the QR code, log into your email, create an account, pick out show genre’s… and a few other steps I felt was a bit much",1
212,2/14/2024,Im very happy with this tv. It's  my 2nd vizio. The picture is perfect and sound is good too. I had my first vizio for 12 years and never had a problem. Just wanted two tv's.,1
213,1/29/2024,"i like the clear, crisp color. fits perfect as my living room is small.  this is my second vizio.  my first one got hit by lightning so i had to purchase another.",1
214,1/25/2024,"The last Vizio tv that I had lasted almost 16 years. It just stopped working, it wouldnt turn on. I hope that this one lasts that long. Great picture and was easy to set up.",1

217,2/17/2024,Marc  was beyond extremely helpful with assisting me to secure my TV on top of my car.  Best customer service I've experienced at this Walmart in 12 months,1
218,2/11/2024,The only thing I dislike is the fact it does not have the app Crunchyroll I am a major anime buff so it's disappointing that I have to airplay my anime shows from Crunchyroll otherwise it functions perfectly,1
219,1/31/2024,"Very nice, clear picture, lots of other features since it's a smart TV. I'd recommend to buy it. I've only had it for a couple of months so I don't know about any problems that still may occur.",1
220,12/10/2023,I bought two 65 inch Vizio Smart TV's during Black Friday. One for myself and one for my daughter and her daughters. As usual they meet ALL Expectations (so far). I would definitely recommend them to anyone who wants to buy one for their family home or for a gift that should last you for years with no problems.,1
221,12/1/2023,"The move is to buy during Black Friday and ship to your house. Free shipping, came literally the same day. So super affordable fast delivery. Can't beat that. Vizio is a great tv brand. These newer models are super light weight, come with feet to attach (I mounted it.) Great picture. Only thing I dislike is the remote size and button options. Very small and easily misplaced.",1
222,12/2/2023,"This TV is super easy to set up. The picture and sound quality are excellent right out of the box.
Vizio's user interface is superior to Google TV. The settings menu is much more user friendly and intuitive. Vizio's streaming platform is complete with so many free live channels and every streaming app you can think of is available. Hooking up an over the air antenna and tuning in local channels completes the package!
We got this for my mom who recently moved into an assisted living facility. I like the everything about this TV better than my Sony that cost twice as much.",1
223,12/12/2023,Great picture and functionality. Only problem was very slow installation download. It took four hours to install software before the TV was ready to use. I have a medium speed connection and it consumed 3 gigabytes of data and I only get 50 gigs of data per month. Because it consumed so much bandwidth I will likely be without high speed internet for the last few days of the billing period. This is not Walmart's fault. I would like to see Vizio have software preloaded that would allow use of the TV with less download time.,1
224,11/29/2023,"I saved $71 on this TV. I wanted a bigger TV for the living room.  I found this bargain but worried it might not be a good TV. I was wrong.  The picture is so crisp and the colors are beautiful.  It was easy to set up by myself.  I am not very tech savvy, but I even managed that by myself.  I did buy a soundbar with the savings as the speakers on the TV don't face forward. They blurred the dialog and made it hard to understand. Soundbar cured the problem.",1
225,12/8/2023,Quality and sound is amazing. Along with this tv I bought the Vizio sound bar and wireless (also Vizio) subwoofer. Yes this is the best I can't wait to finish up setting up my living room so I can really enjoy watching a great movie with the sound yes I know and I can't wait. Get it ALL,1
226,11/2/2023,"This TV gets great marks on the price, the tech inside also makes it an easy win for most buyers. As a gamer you can't beat the VRR support, Dolby Atmos and Vision HDR 10. All the current bells and whistles most gamers through around the web. 

Slight ding for me is a gamma issue i can't seem to solve which leaves most red colors seemingly oversaturated. Other than this great TV. 120hz would be a killer feature at this price. Time will tell oh and maybe Xbox Cloud gaming support.",1
227,11/9/2023,"A good T.V with a great price. The clarity is exceptional and everything I would want in a T.V and more I might want later but not ready for. All in all, a great T.V. I have waited a couple months now for this review to put it through it's paces and I could not be happier with it. There it is.",1
228,12/3/2023,"Its not to heavy, its great for your bedroom.  I've been buying Vizios ONLY since 2010 Im the type of person that wants a tv in every room and this is a great addition. What i noticed is we cant get our tvs fixed you have to buy another so only time will tell 👍🏾 Buy it from Walmart ❤️",1
229,12/7/2023,Delivery driver stole my TV. They did not get a signature from me so now I’m left with waiting on a refund for the amount of the TV that I bought when they quickly chose not to deliver and chose to steal the TV. So I have not been able to enjoy anything.,1
230,12/11/2023,"Was happy with purchase, but had to return it due to the fact that  have another Vizio tv in the same room. Each remote from both tvs were controlling each other.

That is The only reason why I had to return the tv. There is no way to reprogram the remotes to work o oh with one tv unfortunately.",1
231,12/11/2023,"We got this tv to replace our older one that kept losing internet connection. But the picture on this one is amazing, it's like we are in a movie theater watching our favorite tv shows.  Crystal clear picture and installation of apps is also very easy.",1
232,11/30/2023,I ordered online however I did pick unit up via curbside young man was very pleasant quick and also had a partner with him. Brand new out the box no problems have everything I need can't wait to play with my new baby big Vizio customer I brag on them so much lol like I own it. Thanks and great job Vizio and Walmart!! Satisfied happy customer…PS just got approved for a Walmart card w/ great limit yayye. Happy holidays everyone be kind spread love and be safe!,1
233,11/26/2023,"Did not want to spend too much, do not need the latest.  3rd TV of this brand.  Easy setup, sharp picture, no dead pixels, good enough sound. Have Airplay %26 Smartcast; important features for us. Tolerable wait time when changing channels.  Walmart pickup was easy.  Good price.  Very happy with purchase.",1
234,12/13/2023,"As with our previous Visio tvs, this one appears to be great in programming, picture clarity, remote control ease of use, and generally a wonderful television!
I would definitely recommend this produst and I would buy it again!  Can't get much better than that!",1
235,12/9/2023,"I bought this tv to replace a 50"" Magnavox that stopped working.  The picture on this Vizio is beautiful and clear. Setup was very easy and having all streaming apps built in is great. Great TV! If youre looking for a great tv with a beautiful picture, tgen i highly recommend this tv.",1
236,11/21/2023,"This tv is working very well for us. When the Roku is buffering, the Smartcast is quicker. Even though our living room is small, the size is great. Hooked up easily, and mounted on the wall. Definitely need the soundbar. I've always liked our Vizio TVs, hoping this lasts.",1
237,12/2/2023,"Shipping was so fast. I ordered this tv at 6 pm and it was in my doorstep at 7:45 am the next morning. Set up was easy, picture is good and it's not too heavy considering its size. I think m it weighs about the same as my older 43 inch that I replaced it with. I can't really speak for the streaming service or smart tv part of it. We use Apple TV for everything",1
238,12/18/2023,I love the picture quality on this. I had a 32 inch that was a different brand and this picture and sound are much better than I expected on this. I don’t have to worry about not finding what I want. It has tons of apps and I’m glad it’s all right there on the Home Screen. The remote is easy to use not too big like some tv remotes. I love everything about this! It was so easy to set up too but then again I’m pretty tech savvy.,1
239,12/17/2023,"The picture, the sound and most importantly the PRICE. It was easy to set up, and you can pair it with your smartphone! I’m not a tech person but I was able to put all my apps on it that I wanted, it also had apps like Netflix and YouTube and Hulu already programmed, I just had to log into my account! I am super happy with this purchase!",1
240,11/23/2023,"Huge, clear, great price for what u get. It has everything you want or need built to watch or stream anything and u really don't even need your cable service anymore as it has live local channels as well. 
The only drawback is that the new remote is small and few buttons but any older Vizio remote works great so I was set.",1
241,10/27/2023,"Purchased for mom who was having a difficult time seeing her 47"" screen. This solved the problem. Setup was easy. Picture and sound are excellent for a tv at this price point. We had it shipped and was delayed over and over. FedEx kept saying it was ""out for delivery"" but then it wouldn't come. Pretty frustrating as there was no one to contact (according to Walmart and FedEx). But it finally showed and has been a great buy.",1
242,11/22/2023,"Everything was a great process. Fast shipping, I love this TV. It’s a smart TV %26 I can access cable. It shows very clear. Highly recommended. The only thing that I struggled with was screwing the legs on but it’s all set up. Thank you Walmart. 
Happy holidays everyone.",1
243,12/7/2023,"Using in my workout gym in my basement. 
This tv is Bluetooth so I use my earbuds when on the treadmill or working out. 
I use the tv speakers when folding laundry. Have had absolutely no issues with the delivering.  The tv has great picture. I watch Netflix. Prime. Or built in channels. 
Love it !! 50” is a good size for anywhere.",1
244,12/22/2023,"Offers a nice Mid-range experience  for a low range price.  the picture is clear, the menus are simple, the remote is self explanatory,  and the T.V. has tons of apps and free channels to choose from. 

people mention the tv being super quiet.  It was for me out of the box, but then I tinkered with the sound settings and had it auto-balance the sound, and it was fine after that.  (I am hard of hearing as well...).

If i had one thing I wish i could change, it would be the home screen, because I really dont like all the extra ""view this or try this"" stuff on the menus, and would like to have all my preferred menus first...but the fact I can arrange the menus I do use so that my most common apps are in an order i prefer them is enough to make...",1
245,11/4/2023,"I have had the television for a little over a month.  My initial thoughts are the value you get at this price point is difficult to beat.  I was able to purchase this TV on sale for $375.  Being able to purchase a 65"" television from a well known manufacturer with a strong history in making quality electronics for a long time, is unheard of.  If you set proper expectations with what the television is going to offer then you will be very happy with this purchase.  This TV is not going to have the dynamic crystal clear pictures, it will not have a lot of custimation settings, and backlighting issues can be noticeable at times.  You will get a very big screen that is very sleek with very good picture quality (not amazing but ok).  The interact...",1
246,11/20/2023,"Loving this tv. The picture and price are great. I got my tv this past Friday. Had it delivered from a store. Came the same day I purchased it online. Was easy to set up. I tinkered around some with the settings a bit, and now have the picture settings I like. Highly recommend this set to anyone considering a purchase 👍",1
247,12/9/2023,"I was introduced 2 Vizio several years back %26 it's always been a reliable brand. Now, we family has 4 of them, including this that I just purchased. What I liked most about is the customer service. I had an issue w/this TV's remote %26 all I had 2 do was instant message them %26 within a week or so, they sent me a new remote. What i didn't know is that Vizio remotes are suppose 2 be interchangeable, in that, 1 remote is suppose 2 operate another TV if ever there's an issue which X-plains why they sent me the same remote 4 another TV of theirs that I have but pre-programmed 4 this TV. 

At any rate, I like the picture %26 sound qualit. The  setup is rather easy, including the setup of the use of their app 4 matters like warranty registrati...",1
248,11/26/2023,"Works great, great picture, decent sound. I probably will add a sound bar to this. It has an HDMI port specified and ready for a sound bar. Beware this TV does not have a ""tuner"" in it. You will not have channel 3, 4, 5.2, 7.3 etc. It is not something I need, but just know if you plan to tune to stations with an antenna, this model will not do it. I chose it because it has a MULTITUDE of viewing apps. This is it biggest feature,",1
249,11/26/2023,This tv works as expected. The measurements are true to size which was important for me because I was trying to ensure it fit on the current tv console table I have. The tv is clear and the sound is clear. I have no complaints from this purchase. Easy pickup from Walmart as well.,1
250,12/11/2023,Great price and super fast shipping!    The tv was even more than I expected.  Not only did it hook up to my satellite but the built in WiFi connect to my network.  I was able to watch Amazon prime with ease.  Also Vizio seems to have their own streaming service which if you didn’t have another source at least you could watch tv.,1
251,9/15/2023,Everything about this tv is surprising in a good way. Sound and pic are way better than lg or samsung at the same level. Feel ripped off that I went with the big brands when this tv gives you exactly what u want without breaking your wallet.,1
252,5/6/2023,well I just hooked us up today as I purchased it. very light. easy to mount to the wall. picture is beautiful but as I said I just purchased this today. so far I am very happy with this TV. but I will really let you know if I have to add to this if there is a problem.,1
253,2/14/2023,Very lightweight. Crisp picture and affordable.,1
254,7/21/2021,Great picture and everything,1
255,7/11/2022,I love it. Wander over Yonder is brand new again. The picture is amazing.,1
256,7/7/2022,I love everything about this TV,1
257,8/24/2021,My first smart TV. Still learning all it can do. Enjoying very much,1
258,9/28/2022,Truly a great purchase awesome smart tv,1
259,1/2/2022,Works great and is very clear from various angles.,1
260,1/17/2024,ordered tv on Saturday and was picking it up that afternoon.  it was easy to set up picture quality is great. this is m y first Vizio will buy another soon,1
261,1/8/2024,Make sure that you check the width of the TV stand!  We had to use two small bookshelves to set it up in the bedroom...temporary set-up during recovery. Works great! I like the Vizio brand.,1
262,1/19/2024,TV is great. Color is awesome. Sound could be better. Package was a bit damaged with shipping. Nothing was broke but next time will do in store pick up.,1
263,1/4/2024,"We've bought Vizio TVs for years and for good reason.  This is a ""smart"" TV with great features and easily accessible streaming features and a clear, beautiful picture on every channel.",1
264,1/1/2024,"I love everything about VIZIO! I had one many years ago and when that went out, I bought a Walmart brand TV. That went out and I bought another Vizio. It is an amazing TV.",1
265,1/10/2024,"TV has a great picture and sound quality is great.  Set up and smart features make it a snap to start watching right away.
Remote functions are very easy to use.",1
266,1/10/2024,"Great color and sound.  Easy to setup, but took a little longer than expected, with all the updating it had to do.  Paired with my Fire stick remote so it was integrated to the Vizio remote.  Pleasantly surprised about that.",1
267,1/2/2024,I would recommend this tv. Color is amazing and sound quality is great. Not to mention the free channels and movies that is provided with out singing up for a subscription.,1
268,1/7/2024,you can Bluetooth in your own headphones.  I seen this in the description and it was an answer to a problem we have i. our household.  loud TV gone!!!! Thank you Vizio!!!,1
269,1/19/2024,I bought this TV for my daughter. It was a birthday present for her and her boyfriend for both of their birthdays and they just love it. I love it great price big TV screen just what they needed Thank you Walmart once again.,1
270,1/13/2024,Vizio is such a good name brand.  have used them for over 15 plus years.  glad you sell them as have the last three from my Tarpon Springs walmart.very dependable.,1
271,1/4/2024,I love the Vizio brand. Smart tv is great the size is great. It's in my living room ! I also love the fact you can talk to the remote and it does what you tell it to,1
272,7/25/2023,Very good quality television.  Easy set up.  Only caveat is it wants to go to smart tv choices rather than straight to cable that I want.  Picture quality is very good and price was excellent.,1
273,1/12/2024,Has everything you want it to have. Speakers are decent would recommend a sound bar system for sure but for the price it's a 5 star for me holds up well.,1
274,1/10/2024,This television is a great investment for me and my Family! It's exactly what I wanted and needed! I'm very happy with it! It's Beautiful ! We love it!,1
275,12/29/2023,"Pro's:  Great color management, timely software update, quality of product!
 I maybe biased, since i inherited a very good Vizio lcd 40"" ,just died!

Cons : None yet!",1
276,1/3/2024,"Television is excellent...especially for the price.  But the delivery was horrible.  No damage, but they placed my big screen TV outside of the gates in the bright day.  Only by the Grace of God it did not get stolen",1
277,1/4/2024,Tv is great!  Clear viewing and the perks on the tv are great as well. Perfect size for me. Price is reasonable as well. I have had Vizio Tvs for awhile and I like them. Vizio Tvs are great.,1
278,1/19/2024,"At first, I had trouble setting up the TV, but now that I got it working, I am so in love with my TV.  It is so clear as if I'm at the movies. I'm so happy with my choice.",1
279,12/24/2023,Mine was busted when I plugged it in took back no hassle at all. I don't take things back normally because of the hassle s and make me feel like a criminal very well done,1
280,8/26/2023,"The tv is working great but being age 70, I am struggling with the operation. The boice remote does have numbers for charging the channels.  I have to live with that issue.",1
281,12/25/2023,Read a ton of reviews on other brands. We have had this brand for years and has been great. Went from a 32inch to 50inch and will never go back to a smaller TV.,1
282,12/23/2023,I bought this on sale and it is fantastic! The picture and sound are amazing! It's also nice not to have the Netflix set up showing by my TV. I have always bought Visio TV's and this one did not disappoint!,1
283,1/13/2024,Great TV for the price. Bought it for my mother to upgrade her 20 yr old set.  Easy to operate. She's in her 80 s and figured it out very quickly. Great picture.,1
284,1/6/2024,"This TV right out of the box set up, connected to cable and was ready to go. Beautiful picture, clear and the size was perfect. Would recommend for the price anytime!",1
285,1/13/2024,"This is a great TV it if the box! For a value TV the speakers are wonderful and not tin sounding. You do not need a sound bar if you don't want it. 
The picture is brilliant and works perfect for gaming.",1
286,12/23/2023,"I’ve had it since August 2023 now since I moved to my new house and it’s December, about to be janruary 2024 and the tv has Been great so far. No complaints at all highly recommend",1
287,7/3/2023,"Great TV for the price! 
The only drawback is the remote not having channel numbers, or stop, pause, rewind, and forward. What it does have is voice control, so if you can master that, you're set!",1
288,5/12/2021,"Wow! We love this big Vizio TV! This tv replaced a 32"" old model that was impossible to play and enjoy video games on. This TV has a beautiful clear picture and great sound. It's perfect for gaming. Vizio makes great product lines and this M Class tv is the perfect choice of value and quality. We would heartily recommend this model!",1
289,8/20/2023,"The 70"" Vizio V705-J03 is an excellent tv so far.  The delivery was smooth - no issues with cracked screens or missing remotes.  The initial hook-up was easy and connecting everything was simple.  Initializing the app with my credentials and passwords is time-consuming but par for the course.  The functionality and overall picture is absolutely gorgeous.  60 frames per second is ample for streaming Netflix, HBO and YouTube TV.  I did purchase a 36"" Vizio soundbar to compliment the theater-like experience.  My only gripe has been an odd smell from the TV that has been there since the intial plug-in.  3 weeks later and the smell has diffused; and a myriad of people have experienced this anomalous smell.  Apparently, it is just part of the ele...",1
290,8/4/2023,"LOVE this TV.  I was a little worried with the negative reviews, but I'm so glad that I purchased this TV.  It's huge (I upgraded from a 60 inch) and the colors are crisp and the detail jumps off the screen.  I'm seeing movies in a different way with the 4K UHD.  Great value and the delivery went pretty smoothly.  Would 100% buy another one, if needed.  I've loved Vizio products for a while and am happy with this product.",1
291,8/21/2023,"Great TV!! Purchased this for my mother after being the test dummy for the 60 inch version! She loves it a lot and has since gotten rid of some monthly subscriptions. The TV had shows on demand, like Maury, news channels, cheaters, even children’s shows!",1
292,10/8/2023,"Vizio 55"" TV. Great television for the money and brand name. Set up super easy. My Cox Contour remote is automatically set up with it. You can use just one remote, which I love, The cox contour remote. Picture is great, I don't like vivid, but you can choose between 4 pictures of color. the rest was just easy, downloading on it's own.  I love it. 
The remote it comes with is very much like an amazon stick. But I don't use them. One remote is important to me.",1
293,10/7/2023,"I like having it connected to both DIRECT TV  and also the internet ...I really  like all buttons on remote for NETFLIX..CRACKLEE..PLUTO..WATVH FREE...SPEAKER BUTTON TO ASK QUESTIONS..
IT'S GREAT TO USE THE CHROMECAST TO PUT STUFF ON TV SCREEN FROM MY PHONE ETC
.I'M REALLY ENJOYING THIS TV,!!",1
294,10/14/2023,"awesome tv. when compared to my same year, make LG tv of similiar spec, but twice the price, it is really in its own class. it pairs amazingly with the vizio sound bar and sub. sound is crystal clear and the bass is better than i got out of the LG. Remote is perfect size and the features are great.",1
295,10/11/2023,"I say typical because, even thou I read negative reviews, this TV, like every Vizio I have purchased in the last 20 years, have been packed well, arrived in excellent shape, has assembled easily, and put into my “ system” in minutes!!!
This review could get more detailed but I have TV to watch!!
Enjoy this one as much as I!

This TV's pic is amazing! The color is exactly why I wanted to upgrade to 4x!!",1
296,7/11/2023,"It's amazing how fast the electronics world changes.  I've owned several Vizio products over the last 10 years, along with Samsung and others.  Every time a purchase a new TV, I can't believe how sharp the picture is compared to a TV I purchased 2 years ago.  It's kind of like cars, what is cutting edge and only on highline models, will be on every car within 10 years.  The electronic industry is doing it in 2 or 3 years.",1
297,8/16/2023,"Is as described. The only thing I didn't like was the delivery was weird. I was expected to figure out how to get the tv from the curb at the front of my apartment to my apartment door on my own and actually told that's my problem. When I got there to meet the guy he ended up dollying it because it was just me and my 2 small kids, but the fact that I was told it was my problem and expected to drag a 70in tv all the way from the front of my apartments to my door is ridiculous. He should have dollied it to my door in the first place. It was almost a return if he hadn't.",1
298,9/29/2023,I'm greatly appreciative about the selection. I choose this particular flat screen for the clarity and visual settings. Super simple setup with programming my particular entertainment selection. Very satisfied with the retail pricing of this particular model. So once again I'm super satisfied with the brand of electronics.,1
299,7/31/2023,"I wanted Zizio because of their participation with Dolby for HDR. I am by no means ""tech savvy"", but this feature, to me, was important, and I was vastly rewarded! This TV was purchased to replace a 15-yo TV, for my bedroom, which I knew would be used mostly for noise to sleep to. I have since moved it to my livingroom, because it's by far the best TV I've ever owned. Vizio is one to watch! They know what their consumers want!",1
300,7/17/2023,"perfect simple tv. you are able to customize the apps where you want them. there are short cuts for certain apps on the remote itself which is nice. those cannot be changed. it doesn't take forever to turn on. some smart TVs do. for the price, you cant beat it.",1
301,7/31/2023,"This  TV is a great value. The picture is clear and sharp. I found the remote to be very easy to use. Other reviewers commented negatively about using the remote. It was not an issue.  

Many apps are already loaded and ready for you to sign in. Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime video, YouTube, etc. There are also many other viewing selections.",1
302,10/22/2023,This TV arrived the next day after ordering! Fantastic customer service by Walmart. Set it up yesterday and it looks great. Had a little trouble creating the Vizio account but finally completed that and the setup was easy. So far very happy with this purchase.,1
303,6/26/2023,"this is the second Vizio TV I've purchased in the past 6 months, a 70"" for my living room and just recently a 50"" for my bedroom. Very pleased so far. picture and sound are very good, I've got a Vizio sound bar for both that makes it even better. simple to set up and use, only thing I wish it had was voice command like my old Roku TV had.",1
304,8/3/2023,"Easy set up. Crystal clear. I've owned Sonys, Samsungs, and LGs. After many moves from state to state and overseas, tv's breaking here and there, there was no point in spending thousands again and again. Vizio is by far the easiest to set up with a clarity and price point. Only down fall is the tv sound. A matching sound lane is an absolute must!",1
305,10/18/2023,This is my 2nd Vizio. My first one I had for around 12-15 years it still worked but the screen was losing its color. So I decided to replace it with this one. The price fit my budget.  The new technology and lighter weight is fantastic. The visuals are so crisp and vivid. The colors are bright and clear. I hope to have this tv for many years.,1
306,7/14/2023,"This is a pretty good TV with great sound!  I'm not incredibly picky with my A/V.  All I can tell you is that it has a great picture, user friendly, easy to set up, pretty light for its size, and has much better sound than our 55"" Roku TV. We've only had this TV for a week now, so I'll update this review if things go south.  For $400, I can't complain, so far.",1
307,9/24/2023,"I am totally in love with this purchase..it is absolutely beautiful on my bedroom wall and Vizo doesn’t disappoint! I had a 32 inch for years and it was still going strong but I wanted to treat myself to something new for my birthday and this checked all the boxes! Set up was easy, and customer support was great!",1
308,8/19/2023,I Love that I can find my streaming Apps right there on the home page.  I like that it has an awesome picture for gaming and Movies and TV Shows. I dislike that it leans forward after you attack the legs. It makes nervous that it might tip over if the fan blows on it.,1
309,7/8/2023,I love this TV.  My only complaint is that you can't remove apps from it. I was having a problem with an app and needed to uninstall and reinstall only to find out that isn't an option without doing a factory reset. That being said I would still purchase this TV.,1
310,7/22/2023,"This is a great TV at an awesome price- a 50 inch high quality brand for just 259 bucks, awesome.  A nice young man delivered the TV within an hour of me making the purchase. We chose to do the setup ourselves and it was very easy. I was very happy to see that it offered Bluetooth for my headphones as well as the older 3.5mm standard plug, so I can also use my older high end wired headphones, NICE.  You can download the 52 page users manual and view it online or print it, and it has multiple languages, with English being the front one,",1
311,10/17/2023,"I have been using this TV for a few months now and am 100% satisified.  I am not a movie buff or audiophile but this TV definitely satisifies my needs.  I have had no problem, fairly user friendly and the picture and sound are as good as I would hope.",1
312,9/23/2023,"Absolutely wonderful product, Good sound, Excellent graphics, Nice comfortable viewing size, Remote could use a redesign, Lite weight, I feel this was a very good buy for the price. I wish they would add a browser feature for direct internet access; That would work very well with the remote voice feature.",1
313,10/17/2023,"I've only had the tv for a couple of weeks, but so far i really like it. really clear and vibrant picture,  the sound is good and very easy set up process. great  price too. Love the whole layout of the apps...very easy and convient. would recommend.",1
314,8/25/2023,"Our previous Vizio lasted for 14 years of non-stop use and was a floor model in the store so when we were needing to replace it we definitely went looking for another Vizio! And we are not disappointed! Quick delivery (came 2 days early), arrived perfectly, much lighter than our old set and was super easy to hang on our previous tv's wall mount with only buying longer screws. The set up was simple along with pairing it to our dish service and we are very pleased with the crisp color, great sound and going from a 55"" to a 65"" how much bigger %26 brighter the picture is! We are extremely happy with the Vizio brand!",1
315,7/14/2023,"I think as hesitent to buy Vizio brand bc working for the cable company know this brand doesnt last long. there weren't a lot of options in this screen size so I want with it. At this price point I'll be surprised if it last 2 years, but it's going to guest bedroom   and won't be used much. It has a beautiful picture and setup was easy.",1
316,9/25/2023,"Got the 55” V-Series on sale at $298 and I have to say that this beats my $400 LG TV in every way except maybe the TV speakers. Even then, the speakers still sound great. The picture and sound quality are both great for movies and gaming. I wouldn't use the TV speakers to play music because the speakers aren't going to give you the performance you'd want for that but regardless, music still does sound decent.

Install was easy and setup was a breeze. The new software update makes the Home Screen look great. Good job Vizio!",1
317,10/5/2023,"Don't understand all of the negative comments. So far it's been a good purchase. If anything changes I will update you. Good price, nice picture, good sound, looks great on the wall. The Dallas Cowboys look great on it. I will update you if anything changes.",1
318,8/7/2023,"When you first turn it on the tv is in demo mode. After completing set up process the picture improves. Smart features are an asset. I can log into my youtube account! 👌
Combined with my ROKU and Directv I have endless channel options. 
I'm glad I opted for the 43"" (bedroom). Not too big yet large enough to enjoy. Picture and sound are very good… granted I use a soundbar and subwoofer.",1
319,7/12/2023,"So far, so AWESOME!!! I love that it's a Smart TV. It has more apps, then most, the price was right, and; it comes with Redbox App, which it definitely a huge benefit, via; most Smart TVs don't come with that app and free live TV (WITH MORE TV PROGRAM OPTIONS)....",1
320,10/5/2023,My sister just bought a house and I'm not one to get her basic gifts. I got her a blender and she was already so ecstatic about that. This can the day after and she was at a loss for words. She hasn't even opened the box and already she's soooooooo happy with it! :),1
321,8/21/2023,"Likes: Great picture clarity. Wide variety of choices without having to have cable. This smart tv let’s you watch channels without having to pay for expensive cable. You just need internet connection. Very simple to set up. 

Dislikes; that o didn’t get one sooner.",1
322,10/5/2023,I bought this tv in a 75 in for myself last year. I went to my parents house and their tv was so small I couldn't see over the wood burning stove so I bought them this tv in a 65in. Now they have a big tv in their living room everyone can see when they come to visit,1
323,7/8/2023,I am sooo happy with this tv!!!! Came on time %26 in perfectly great condition packed very safe. This was so easy to set up ! I am so not into technology at all so I was afraid to get a smart tv.  My son started up it took less than 8 minutes for all the scanning or searches and it automatically recognized our WiFi. I don't see great I wear glasses and being able to say Netflix or prime or Hulu is great. Didn't need to do anything for the voice remote to work. Only improvement would be for the remote to light up but that's not a big deal. The tv is so so nice for 317.00 with tax this 55 inch looks bigger than it is idk if it's bcuz it's in my room but everyone of my kids and grandson thought it was big and my grandsons room has a 70 inch ! ...,1
324,7/14/2023,"I like this TV. We had a bumpy start but not sure if it was new internet service or new TV but since all is good now, I give that a pass. The set up was easy enough after I realized my internet was tweaky. The HD picture is vibrant and sound is great too!! I hope it lasts for only $300",1
325,10/4/2023,"This is a two part review as the product itself was a great quality and we've been really happy upgrading to all Vizios in our home. I do want to say though that the Walmart employees who delivered it, they didn't just knock on the door and drop it. They walked it in the house and placed it in the living room and I send them out with a thank you tip and waters. Could not say how much I appreciated it being a mom at home by myself and having to consider getting that tv up the front steps. Big appreciate for going above and beyond.",1
326,9/15/2023,"The 65"" Smart TV from Vizio is a great item. The picture, speed of actions, price, and being lightweight (wall-mounted) are definitely a plus. My only concern is the smaller size of the remote. Yes, It is a bit slight and because of that it is actually a cumbersome remote to operate. 
The sound is good for a flat-screen TV, however, I ordered the Vizio surround sound system and the sound has intensified the listening enjoyment. I would recommend this product.",1
327,8/18/2023,"I know there are numerous tv brands to choose from that are equally good as the Vizio. However, I've bought and trust the Vizio brand for over 20 years. I have never encountered any issues. The features are fantastic. This tv purchase is actually replacing my older model 65"" Vizio that I've had for over 13 years. No issues with the older model. I'm actually paying it forward and giving it to a friend. She's overjoyed to receive it.",1
328,7/12/2023,"my tv died on the 4th of July weekend.. I ordered this tv the same night, and it was delivered the next morning for me. Excellent packaging, easy to unpack and assemble. No need for a second person. I did all by myself easy peasy. The picture is excellent, easy to set up, and easy to use remote....price is a steal. I highly recommended it.",1
329,3/29/2023,Love the interface of this TV! The only thing I was missing was how to add additional apps. Couldn't figure it out if it is an option. I ended up buying a Roku stick to add for my other network apps that aren't included. This is so much more user friendly than Samsung in my opinion.  Great color and clarity.,1
330,10/7/2023,"Love this TV. It loads up fast, has a bunch of apps already installed, including Chromecast, and you can customize it by adding other apps. The picture is great, and I really love the voice-activated remote control. I got this TV on sale for $398 and couldn't be happier with it.",1
331,9/15/2023,"Very vivid ..lightweight-easy to unbox and setup.
   ps5 games with hdr10 enabled look amazing. 
auto recognized and labels console and firetv. 
Bluetooth to 5.1 system audio has good timing NO delay or lag voice sync. didn't test builtin speakers too much.Seemed a bit flat 
Os kind of laggy vs firetv max.
Overall pleased. showing friend a 4k scene on you tube looked great",1
332,9/18/2023,Was wanting an inexpensive larger screen television. Looked at the Hisense and the Vizio.  Can't address the longevity since I just got it but the quality build and ease of setup put Vizio Head and Shoulders above the hisense. The Hisense legs were plastic that just attached on the outside of the back. The Vizio legs are metal and actually slide up inside the frame of the TV and attach.  To start the Vizio all I had to do was plug in the Amazon Fire stick it automatically connected with our Wi-Fi and within 60 seconds I was ready to watch. The Hisense Roku wanted me to set up a Roku account and jump to a lot of hoops before I could watch TV.  The picture on the Vizio is fantastic and for the extra $20 it was well worth getting the Vizio.,1
333,8/6/2023,"It’s a fine TV. Would be fantastic if it had 120Hz refresh rate, but can’t expect that on a TV at this price point. If you’re a casual TV watcher or like to do basic console gaming, this TV is a great choice. Price seems very reasonable. Picture clarity out of the box is great and the sound from the speakers seems fine. I’d recommend a matching sound bar for better quality audio if this will be your primary TV.",1
334,4/18/2023,Great picture and sound. You can talk to the remote. Love the size.,1
335,4/6/2023,Lightweight and easy set up. Quality for the price.,1

337,11/18/2023,"a very nice tv. a bit blurry with fast motion movie scenes, video game play, but no worse than any other 60 hertz",1
338,1/25/2024,I purchased this item at what appeared to be a sale. I am glad that I did. It fits the space perfectly. The picture quality is very good as well.,1

358,10/30/2023,"I love my new 64 inch tv.
It looks great on the wall and color quality is beautiful.
Make sure you have enough wall space if mounting, you don't want to over power the Tv on a wall to large or too small.
I am very well pleased.",1
359,11/22/2023,"The picture, sound, and quality are top notch! I love the new Vizio Home Screen and set up was a breeze. Zero regrets on this purchase and would do it again….if I needed another wall-sized TV. ;)",1

363,12/7/2023,Pictures are clear and also great for my surround sounds.  All my favorite apps are located on the home screen along with free movies to watch accommodation from Vizio.,1
364,10/26/2023,Graphics are good for a family room. No lag on xbox video features. easy to move and view. Vizio has reliability over the long term. Definitely would like to get the sound bar for increased volume.,1

372,12/11/2023,Love Samsung. Had to update as it's not the newest model but works great and a great price. Picture quality is the best and Samsung free tv is a huge plus!,1

471,8/9/2023,"This 75 inch looks so vivid and being a smart tv helps get rid of the fire stick, so anytime you don't have to keep up with one less remote is a plus for me. I had a 55 inch so this is definitely a upgrade and the price was fantastic.",1

489,10/15/2023,"I bought this tv because i like the brand and it was on sale; my tv of 5  years randomly went out on me. It has so many capabilities that i dont use, the tv is smarter than me most days. It has never disappointed me.",1
490,7/17/2023,"good picture. volume is very fine-tunable, meaning one click of the volume button doesn't make it go from quiet to loud. I've owned it for a couple of months now and no issues.",1
491,8/27/2023,Native interface is slow as some have mentioned at times. I considered this before purchase and figured it didnt matter since I would plug in a 4K Firestick anyway. Works like a champ that way and has a very good picture.,1
492,8/11/2023,"I like this tv and I have another one just exactly like it but the screen is broken. They wouldn't replace it even though I purchased the extra warranty, (which was the only reason I purchased the warranty). Vizio wouldn't replace it either.",1

495,7/11/2023,This tv is excellent and I’m so glad I purchased it! It was the easiest setup ever. The picture quality is gorgeous and there’s so many features such as free channels and lots of them. It’s an amazing tv!,1
496,10/1/2023,This tv is awesome. I still haven’t tried out all of the different features as of yet but it’s definitely worth the price. The only problem was that it didn’t come with a remote control in the box and I had to contact Vizio to get one.,1
497,10/23/2023,"TV works great, though it is a bit weird to have a remote control with NO number buttons on it. Might eventually replace the remote with a different one.",1
498,8/12/2023,my other tv which was a 50 inch was about 5 yrs old the picture went white had volume but no picture so i bought this 55 inch which is a lot taller but its taking sometime to adjust. so far it us ok picture is more vivid.,1
499,9/26/2023,"The picture is AWESOME  !! The sound sucks  "" it's not really the volume it's the bass  , it's lousy  !!!   
I hooked up a sound bar and it's a whole different animal  ""  it went from a guinea  pig to a LION  !!!!",1
500,10/2/2023,"This replaced an earlier version 43"" model of the same maker, that the screen pixeled out after a misshap. A little long getting the updates installed. But it was a good choice as a replacement.",1

506,9/11/2023,The TV is great size. The sound isn't best quality but we ordered a sound system so we will see how that goes. It came quick and it was packaged well.,1
507,8/13/2023,"The set up was so simple. Great picture, I should get a sound bar for it.

this brand.  He's an engineer so I did.  This is the best way to go. The picture, sound and pixels are very good. It's a great 
value for the price!",1
512,9/20/2023,very easy app too navigate im loving the tv itself and props to the delivery guy for getting it on my porch in great shape and going the extra mile for tucking it behind my patio furniture,1
513,7/14/2023,Picture quality is great! We love it. We prefer the old school tv's because the new tvs have to be “set up” before you can turn it on to watch. Great price and is worth it overall.,1
514,9/5/2023,"Shipping was perfect, easy to set up,  we really like Vizio tv's.  Our last one was about12 yrs old and still in great condition. No issues.  We just wanted a bigger one.",1
515,10/8/2023,Amazing picture quality for the price. It was easy to attach to the mount and easy to set up. The tv runs smoothly over Wi-Fi. Picture quality is far better than my 4k ONN tv.,1
516,7/4/2023,Vizio is a great brand.  I have not used this tv yet as I am waiting for someone to set it up.  The delivery was fast and efficient.  She was also very kind and friendly.,1
517,7/21/2023,Love it! The picture quality is great and so are the features. I love that you can easily keep track of what devices are plugged in back to the HDMI ports and that they are all named-it's not a guessing game.,1
518,8/28/2023,"Menu system is very fast, the remote is pretty intuitive. The colors are very vivid, 4K looks excellent and for a 50-in TV it weighs nothing. Speakers could be better but that is the way it is with most TVs you have to buy a sound bar.",1
519,7/25/2023,"This tv was a perfect fit for over the fireplace in our den, we have another larger one over our mantle in the living room. Both Vizios have beautiful picture definition, sound and love all the apps it came with. Id definitely recommend to everyone.",1

521,8/4/2023,I love the quality the picture is awesome. The interface is cool as well. I would say what I don't like about the TV would be it kicks off the voice command sometimes.,1
522,7/16/2023,"we love this tv,  it was easy to set up, and use.  Ilike there is a an app you can use in the event you misplace the remote.It has a very clear high definition picture.",1
523,10/22/2023,"We bought two of these. One 6 months ago for family room. Now a 2nd one for living room. It was recommended by Kurt the Cyber guy and cannot be beat for the price,",1
524,7/9/2023,Great TV for the price. We use it in the bedroom. The picture is great and the volume is good too. It’s very light so be careful if it’s at kids height. They can easily knock it down.,1
525,7/6/2023,"Amazing tv great picture %26 sound plus it was delivered same day I bought and they were very gentle with it
It was more than I wanted to spend but totally worth it",1
526,8/26/2023,"The sound is not loud enough you got to turn it up high on some movies, but the TV is great so far.  I've always had VIZIO TV, and I never had problems with them.",1
527,10/8/2023,Don’t need cable with this tv alls you need is internet and you can watch live tv and on demand. No subscription needed unless you want to subscribe to anything that’s not included.,1
528,7/16/2023,"I saw this Vizio listed on sale on the app and bought it. I replaced a 65 inch Philips. I am very happy with everything. The picture quality, and the app menu screen.",1

530,7/1/2023,"I liked the quick and prompt service and delverly I recieved. The delivery person also helped me locate my 55"" TV as it was too much for.me.to handle with my bad wrist. He was very courtesy in giving me.a hand.",1
531,10/3/2023,"Purchase this tv for my living room. At first, I thought it was too big to fix on the entertainment. But, my daughter and I were able to add the legs and it fits perfectly.",1
532,7/5/2023,I gave this TV 5 stars. The picture is so clear %26 the apps are easy to access. A big thanks to Walmart %26 Vizio for such good service %26 pricing. I highly recommend this TV.,1
533,7/28/2023,I love the sharp colors and clear picture. It was also easy to set up which is a plus. So glad I chose this TV.  Fast delivery is also great. I didn't have to worry about getting it in my car,1
534,7/18/2023,"I had a quick delivery with no damage to the box. This Vizio 50” LED smart TV is so much better than my last TV. 
In the “1950”s all tv’s had a round picture and were black and white pictures.",1
535,7/5/2023,"This was the first time I utilize the online service and I was quite impressed. Young lady that bought the television said she was very very nice and very very respectful. If I could, I put a recommendation in her folder. Thank you.",1
536,9/15/2023,The best and sharpest picture in a television that I have purchased.. the price of this television was incredible.. I've always wanted a Visio tv and very happy with the purchase.. would highly recommend,1

539,10/5/2023,"You can access all your favorite apps, has bluetooth for wireless headphones, easy to navigate. Works great with my directv. Plus, it has a tons of free programs!",1
540,7/5/2023,I did need help setting up the TV for an antenna.   Unfamiliar with the newer technology  and figuring out the remote was the biggest hold up.  Couldn't pass up the price.  It really is a very nice TV.,1
541,10/18/2023,This is a wonderful tv at such a good price.  We can see every thing and read what's going across the bottom of screen.  Great for senior's.  Glad we have it.,1
542,7/7/2023,"This was an amazing price on a real good tv. It replaced the Vizio we had, and the tv went kaput after a storm recently. But I know it was a great tv because it lasted 12 years. I trust Vizio.",1
543,5/18/2023,"The price was a plus. This Tv has a beautiful picture. Easy to set up, Had to use a table top TV mount. The TV is a 55 inch big screen. This company has been around for some time. I have also seen good reviews. I would recommend if you are in the market.",1
544,5/19/2023,Got this tv home and it was packaged very well. The feet were easy to put on and fit my tv stand beautifully. The setup was easy to understand and did a good job walking me through the basic settings. The picture has been wonderful so far with no issues! Only complaint is the smart tv menu design by Vizio could be more intuitive but it gets the job done. I use my phone as a remote and all my apps I use are favorited so I have real easy access to them. Overall this a great TV!,1
545,5/16/2023,So far so good with this TV (unlike my other Visio which likes to reboot randomly- sometimes multiple times in a row).  This TV is not one of the main TVs in the house- just something for workout videos in the basement gym. It's performing as expected for now (3 months in).,1
546,9/22/2021,Great Tv for the $$$,1
547,6/17/2023,"The Tv is completely fine, it's a big tv, I love it, I don't know why so many people have negative reviews about it, it was not damage, I like the screen, the volume is normal, everything about the tv is perfect, basically if you're not careful with it, of course it will crack, but mine came perfectly fine. I now own 2 visio tv, a 43 inches and a 65 inches. Don't hesitate to buy it, a 65 inches for $398, is more than enough.",1
548,7/17/2022,Excellent TV,1
549,11/14/2022,luv my tv,1
550,6/19/2023,Very satisfied with the service I received from Walmart on my recent purchase of a Vizio TV. It was delivered as promised as quickly as anyone could expect. Packaging was a good condition. It's now up on the wall working fine thank you Walmart good job.,1
551,5/24/2023,"I wanted a smart TV as we had oura for 12 years and I was tired of using a gaming system for streaming. This TV has all the apps you could imagine. I wish the quick buttons had better platforms, but the setup is great so I was able to organize them according to our preferences. 5/5",1
552,5/10/2023,So far so great. I was hopeful that delivery would be fine. it was. Im delighted with this purchase. I live the press and speak option on the remote saves you from scrolling for channels. just say find peacock and it brings up the channel. I no longer am squinting another plus. I did what another's review said and went into system and turned up the volume and now  I don't have to use a higher volume each time I watch something. It was less than a new x box my grandson just got. Crazy.,1
