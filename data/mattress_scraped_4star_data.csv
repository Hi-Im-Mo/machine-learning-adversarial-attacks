7/14/2014,"I purchased this mattress in August of 2011 and paid $209 for the queen size plus $70 shipping as free shipping was not available on the item at the time (hence my 4/5 rating on value, seeing as it would be around $100 cheaper now then when I originally purchased the item).

The mattress is one of the most comfortable mattresses I have had and I received major compliments on the cloud like feel. I was a bit apprehensive to order a mattress-in-a-box and was definitely hard to explain it to friends and family that the bed literally inflated upon arrival.

In or around December of 2013 I too began to experience the sinking in the mattress. After months of uncomfortable rest I was tempted to buy a new mattress. I was going to buy the same exact...",4 out of 5 stars review
4/17/2020,"The mattress is excellent for the price. It was easy to setup and the quality looks good. Note that the mattress is extra firm, so if you lay flat all night, you will ""feel"" it in the morning, but nothing too bad, especially considering the price. Mattress prices are ridiculous so if you're looking for something of good quality and inexpensive, you won't be disappointed.

I've had to deduct the 1 star because Walmart's packaging was disastrous. I was surprised to see the mattress wasn't damaged. The packaging was torn in multiple places as if rats as eaten through it.",4 out of 5 stars review
3/23/2021,I bought this because one it was affordable. And 2 its just a temp for now. My son loves it. And im hoping my twins do as well. It cane in a box and soon as i unwrapped it. It open real quick. With plastic on to protect it. Very happy for my purchase. Why i gave it 4 stars? Only slight issue is it had a tiny space between the mattees and the bed. Which isnt a big deal but I would rather it fit perfectly,4 out of 5 stars review
6/20/2021,"I give This mattress four ‚≠ê because I will buy it again for a child. The side holds up well to adult weight.

1/19/2014,"This mattress is easy to carry if you need to pick it up at the store. It comes in a box that although it does not fit into the trunk of the average car, it will fit nicely into a minivan without even removing the seats. Once you get it, gather the family around the bedroom, and let them watch the show as it comes out of the box rolled up like a tamale and becomes a full fledge mattress. A good mattress. I recommend it.",4 out of 5 stars review

11/18/2022,"I think for the price you cannot beat the bed at all! I am not very hard to please though, and again the price was really good.
My discrepancy is more with the shipment company because they seem to have probably mishandled it before it got here and so it had a little indention on one side when expanding out but with time it kind of worked itself out for the most part.
So if you need a mattress for a guest room or you just need a new mattress for yourself and you're not wanting to pay much right now then pretty good deal for $120 a full size.",4 out of 5 stars review

5/24/2011,"My children needed a full mattress for a bunk bed that we also purchased from Wal-Mart. We all were a little skeptical because it came in a box, but it worked out really nicely. Be sure to put it where you would like it before unwrapping it because it's easier to move in the box. It takes about 20 min to fill out and be comfortable. It is a little soft, but is a great buy in comparison to other mattresses this thick. Give it a try, you'll enjoy the rest!!",4 out of 5 stars review

When I got to the store I saw how big the box was and was like OMG how am I gonna get that in my car! I purchased the Queen size mattress in the box plus the metal frames so I had two huge boxes. I did manage to get both of them in my car thanks to the Walmart employee who was very nice. My husband and I managed to get it up to our third floor Townhome as it was a little heavy.

I will agree with one of the previous reviews that it is a little bit too firm. Luckily, I had a gel soft foam eggshell type deal that I put on top, flat side up. It's the perfect mix of having a firm foundation with the perfect amount of softness to it. My boyfriend says it's the most comfortable Matress he has slept on even more than his own bed.

Positives

Price: I paid $99 + $6 tax for a total of $105. I replaced a popular name-brand mattress whose current (9/1/2017) advertised price is $652.

Free shipping.

Shopping convenience: No having to shop in retail stores.

Delivery convenience: No hassling with transporting the mattress, paying for delivery, or even having to be home when it is delivered. The box was left standing beside my front door.

No strong odor. I am sensitive to strong odors and was pleased that the mattress didn't stink.

It arrived via site-to-store very quickly. It was rolled up and vacuum-packed in a box (roughly 60lbs; the box was able to fit into my sedan). It was easy to open and get set up on my bed frame by myself. It didn't really have any noticeable odor unless you put your face right up against it.

10/9/2016,"The mattress arrived on time and was easily maneuvered  upstairs and atop the bunk bed.  My grandson was anxious to sleep on it that night so 4 hours to ""reboot"" was all the time we gave the mattress.  Plenty of time for the air to ""fill"" the mattress back up.  No fumes, everything was fine.  The 12 year old twin boys take turns sleeping on it, and are comfortable.  I climbed up there and found the mattress to be quite comfortable.   Pleasantly surprised in the comfort  as I really was just filling a void.  I had just purchased the bunk ( from Walmart) and needed the twin mattress.

I like the fact that it comes in a box so I can choose to collect from store without worrying if it will fit in the car or not. The only downside is that you can not turn the mattress over every couple of months as you are supposed to because only one side has cushioning enough to sleep on. You could just rotate it so it doesn't wear in one place though, that would work.",4 out of 5 stars review
8/22/2023,"Very comfy, perfect balanced between firm and soft. 8"" really is enough unless you want that ultra soft sinking feeling. The only thing is that there's no edge support so you don't want to sleep too close to the edges, but it's good for the $125 price. (Also please buy a queen size bed if you are over 5'11"", my feet are always hanging outside of the bottom edge, I really regret saving that $50 and it's too frustrating to return a mattress so I'll just have to sleep diagonally...)",4 out of 5 stars review
3/15/2017,"I purchased a king size mattress-in-a-box and give it high marks. It was exactly as advertised and an excellent alternative to much higher priced mattresses. I wanted an economical mattress as I planned to cover it with 4"" memory foam. The combination is better, imo, than a mattress costing 10x as much. Don't be afraid of buying one of these coil spring mattresses from Walmart, they are an excellent option. The delivery took longer than 2 days, as advertised, and they apologized and issued to me a 5$ voucher. And shipping was free! I would recommend this mattress to friends and would purchase one again!",4 out of 5 stars review
1/27/2012,"Very pleased with this mattress. just as comfy as one of those high end brands.

I, however, was mislead to believe that with this mattress, a boxspring was not needed. I have a small metal bed frame that I brought to college with me and picked up the mattress after I moved into my new apartment. After putting the frame together, I put the mattress on the frame and the mattress fell right through the frame. The whole reason for me buying the mattress was so that I didn't have to buy a boxspring.

Overall, the mattress sleeps great, even just with it on the floor.",4 out of 5 stars review
11/17/2016,"I read almost half of all the reviews on this mattress before I purchased it. I liked that most people thought it was a great value for the price and offered ""solid"" body support. I agree, however it should be noted that as a previous reviewer said, ""the edges of the mattress have more give"" than a standard mattress. That means if you do a lot of sitting on the edges of this mattress you will sink down quite a bit. If that's not a big deal to you than this mattress is one of the best deals around!!

Upon opening the box we were amazed at how well vacuum-packed it was.  Essentially it was folded in half and then rolled up.  After marveling at it for a bit we opened it up and watched as it began to inflate.  In the whole opening ceremony my kids lost the paperwork/instructions so I took the advice of the friend who had recommended it to us and let it expand for 3 full days. We just set it up last night and last night was its first sleep.

The mattress itself is comfortable for me. It is  very firm, so if you need more give  I would suggest getting a  thick mattress topper.  I didn't notice  any odor when it was unrolled.  I let it reinflate for 24 hrs.,  but it only got to 6 inches  instead of the 8 inches.  Not a big deal for me.  It sleeps comfortable,  and finally my feet don't hang off the end of the bed!

This latest version doesn't have the satin finish like the original one I had. The material is more of a full cotton, almost plush tissue-like material. Still equally as soft but not expected.

When I got home and cut open the box, you can see that the bed basically looks like it has been vacuum sealed into a really larger plastic bag. Once you break the plastic, you immediately here the bed start to suck in air, lol. It started to inflate into a full size twin bed instantly. Within 5 mins of removing its packaging, we had it on the floor and my boyfriend who is 6' and 240lbs, laid on it and complemented on how comfortable it was.

When I opened the box the first thing I thought was: this is a mistake. How are you going to fold this thing back up and lug it to the store? Even though it expanded as promised, I was still skeptical.

I let it breathe for the recommended time. When I did sleep on it, I was amazed. I kept waiting for it to collapse but no, I slept like a baby. I don't know who this mattress would not work for, but it works great for me. I'd buy another without thinking twice.",4 out of 5 stars review

mattress expanded relatively quickly to 8.5 inches.  It is a nice looking mattress

The other thing that I noted is in spite of the claims for having firm edge support, in reality the edges have very little support.  I definitely prefer having firmer edges on a mattress.  Overall, I find the mattress to be fairly comfortable but will know more after a few months of sleeping on it.",4 out of 5 stars review
3/30/2013,"Too good to be true? It's not! I was skeptical that a mattress-in-a-box would be a poor choice, but I was surprised when I slept on it. It's firm, but not too hard. It also is much more comfortable than I would have imagined it to be.

It arrives in a box that can be carried/handled by one person. It is a bit heavy and awkward when you unwrap it, but it positions easily. Once the sheets were on it, it was ready to go. It took about two days to fully ""puff up"", but it was comfortable right out of the box. The edges are a bit soft, so don't sleep on the edge.

I'm pleasantly surprised how comfortable this mattress is (I spent most of the day in bed simply relaxing).",4 out of 5 stars review
5/5/2014,"Overall, a very good value. If using/buying for permanent/primary mattress, I prob wouldn't recommend if you were heavier set, say maybe 250lbs or more. The springs are not as heavy gauge so it could affect the comfort levels, and you can also feel them on the edges. I'm 6' 2"" and it feels really good to me. Def not a high end mattress, but a great value for spare/guest bedroom(for non-heavy guests imo lols) which is what we bought this for. Easy ordering and delivery. Weighs about 60lbs or so. Easy unpacking, but let it ""air out"" for a day or so for it to fully expand before sleeping on it.",4 out of 5 stars review

It expanded in moments and I laid on it to nap - without blankets or sheets it was superb. Later when time to go to bed for the night with sheets and blankets - I slept like a baby - or so they say that is what it was like.

the mattress is much thinner than what you get elsewhere.

I was thinking perhaps they messed up order and sent a mattress topper and not the mattress. Well, I was wrong. Twin size mattress bundled up tight and air sucked out.

10/29/2012,"I literally looked at this mattress online for a week before purchasing. The price was right, but I just COULD NOT imagine a comfortable and quality mattress fitting in a box. I had the mattress shipped to my local store. I picked up the box (make sure you have help lifting it's small but heavy). I got the box home --- opened the packaging --- cut the tape wrapped around the mattress and literally almost like magic the mattress was sitting perfectly on top of the frame. The mattress is COMFORTABLE and of good quality. I've had a few friends stop by who were curious about ""bed in a box"" -- now I've got a few of my friends sold.

good price.
good mattress! I am satisfied.",4 out of 5 stars review
2/24/2013,"The box is pretty heavy so you might want some help. In seconds it had taken its shape. The single mattress is great. If you are looking for a queen I would suggest to get it a few inches higher. The single looks great and is Very comfortable. The queen is less comfortable, cause of support I think. If buying for a child, daughter said it was a little to firm for her liking. Now she is okay with it though. Overall great product.",4 out of 5 stars review

5/17/2013,"We purchased 2 of these mattresses for a twin room in our shrt term rental property. They look the part and seem comfy enough but I only laid on them breifly. It's hard to buy something like this when you haven't had the chance to feel it or see it, not like buying a TV on line, but they seem nice enough. They arrived within the time frame and the box that they came in was small enough to get in the rental car so no worries about delivery. When we got them home they popped open very easily as soon as we removed the packaging, I recommend you remove the packaging with the mattress in the place where you want it to be.

3/29/2013,"The slumber 1 mattress in a box is a good product, its very soft & cozy. The reason I say good and not excellent is that all though it's vacum sealed and made to bounce back the coils in the middle where the fold is has not bounced back to its full capasity. I brought the mattress to replace my old one which sink also, I WAITED A FULL 48 HOURS before sleeping on it and the coils did not return to normal from the fold so it is firm all over with a light sink in the middle which will eventualy cause the mattress to be replaced. I wasnt going to use a box spring but I did any way it holds it better . Over all the comfort of the mattress is great I would recommend it to a friend, but for the company that main fold does affect the coils.",4 out of 5 stars review

2/16/2014,Great mattress for the price. Comfortable and you can't tell when your mate or spouse gets out of bed which is priceless. Only problem I had was when it was shipped. I paid standard shipping which say it would come the same day as if you paid for fast shipping. So I thought great I don't have to wait as long as if I just did the free shipping. The date they say it was going to arrive it did not. I received one part of my order on Saturday and the other part which was the mattress Monday night. So I could not get off the couch until Monday night. Don't say it would arrive one date and it doesn't is hard.,4 out of 5 stars review
2/10/2014,Excellent purchase. The only reason for 4 stars is that it is not very firm but what can you expect from a mattress in a box. By no means is it intended for an adult to sleep on every night but it works perfect for our daybed. I will be purchasing another for the trundle. This would also be great for a child's bed.,4 out of 5 stars review

5/11/2014,"Bought this for a replacement in the guest room. Given the price, not sure this would be great for everyday use but really only time will tell. Packed in a box in a very compressed manner but quickly expanded to full size. We have this one an extremely firm foundation, really made of all wood. So far holding up well with a firm feel. Might be questionable for use with very heavy people, but for <200 pounds a winner for occasional use for sure.",4 out of 5 stars review
7/3/2013,"It fits my needs. This is the mattress where I sleep every day (full size) and is very comfortable. I am about 132 pounds, and my wife is a few pounds lighter.

9/10/2013,"This mattress was bought to upgrade from a queen to a king, as well as to fit into our tight budget. The product shipped in a timely manner and were minimal box damages. However, Walmart does not require a signature from delivery which the item(s) ordered are just left at your door. (Don't care for that much). It was packaged well and somewhat easy to undo, but having a king sized may require a back up person...just in case. This was purchased along with the Spa Sensations Steel Smart Base Bed Frame Black, King, which arrived first. The frame says there is no need to get box, but extra support underneath does not hurt.

I used it for about 3 years and definitely could have gotten a few more years of use, but we were moving and had to get rid of some bigger items.

I am not disappointed with my purchase. Don't know how long it will hold up until I have used it for a while. It may be some time before I know, as I bought it to use in our guest bedroom, so it will not be used every night. But once it comes to it's natural size you cannot tell it from a regular mattress.

The mattress is quite comfortable, though it's not as firm as advertised, which is why it didn't get a five-star rating.

We got it home and removed it from the box and WATCH OUT it was like the water sponges....it just kept growing. Sure enough, it was a twin 8"" mattress w/coils. It was truly amazing. Now, for the comfort review.....my husband and I both lay down on it and it does appear to be quite comfortable for the price. It goes in our granddaughter's room for her bunkbed.

We were a bit unsure how a quality mattress could come in a box 1/2 the size, but it has been great. I would recommend this bed for any child or as a guest bed.

So, I was looking for something that was affordable yet comfortable. This mattress came relatively quick (about 4 days after ordering it). Once the queen sized mattress came, it was a little difficult to get up the stairs of my house alone. I recommend having a friend or roommate help you. Once I took the mattress out of the box and plastic, it rose almost immediately. I was able to sleep on it that same night (after letting it sit out for about 4 hours). I've had the mattress for about two weeks now and I haven't had any problems at all. Great buy. Great value.",4 out of 5 stars review

One person can carry this mattress in it's box, easy to open, fluffs up quickly, most important..comfy! Going to buy another one for our older son.",4 out of 5 stars review

I offered to buy a firmer mattress and she said no. The mattress has a feather bed on top that made her standard dorm plastic covered mattress very comfortable. She has a plush top firmer mattress at home. I think fir the price it was a great buy.",4 out of 5 stars review
7/14/2016,"We already had another mattress like this that lasted for 5 years and was still solid. The only reason we did replace it was after my youngest kept getting hand me downs from big brother so often, we thought they both deserved 2 brand new mattresses to go along with our new house. Just like the old one, they instantly popped into shape when unloaded from the box and we were able to use them that same night. The 5 and 6 year old boys are comfortable and sleep all through the night in their new beds. I certainly would recommend it to a friend because one of my girlfriends asked about them after seeing new ones in my boys rooms and plans on purchasing one for her 8 year old.",4 out of 5 stars review

8/18/2016,This is the 2nd one that I have purchased this year. Both are full sized. Mattress is firm but not hard as a rock. The only downside is that it can not be flipped.

2/2/2017,"I needed a new not-too-expensive mattress. I had a super firm very expensive mattress that was like sleeping on a rock.  I gave it to charity and bought a 13"" air mattress which also didn't work.

As other people have commented, it is heavy, but I was able to push to the bedroom.  I opened when delivered at 8pm, and slept on it at midnight.  No offensive odor.   I have it on regular bed frame and box springs.

3/11/2017,"Had hoped for a ""big"" improvement in sleeping over my many-years-old mattress.  I do seem to sleep a little bit better, but not sure the mattress gets the credit.  The whole concept of a mattress rolled tightly into a cylinder that then expands into a pretty normal innerspring mattress is truly mind-boggling.  I gave it even more than the 24 hours called for to fully ""inflate,"" but I think I could have used it in a few hours at most.  I can't be sure it actually ""grew"" more with the extra time.
The mattress is firmer than I had hoped and has a pretty thin pillow-top.  I added my old eggcrate again, and it's not bad.
One thing is certain.  I've never seen anything else that comes close to the price, for which it could have been a disaster.  ...",4 out of 5 stars review

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because no one has slept on  the mattress yet.,4 out of 5 stars review

For under $200 I am ecstatic that I was able to complete the set up for another bedroom.",4 out of 5 stars review

My daughter absolutely loves this mattress and sleeps so much better.  While I've only laid on it a few times, she says its like sleeping on a cloud.

It is not the absolute best (I did add a pillow top for extra comfort for mine) but it is comfortable. My daughter finds it very comfortable with no extras.

She was in a toddler bed, which meant the floor for us :( We purchased a full-size mattress to put on the floor until she's big enough for a frame and box spring. I also purchased a foam topper and quilted mattress cover to go on this since it was only 8"" tall, and I was worried about the comfort level coming from a box.

It is very comfortable for all of us to sleep on. Hubby and I are both fairly large people, so I don't know how well it would hold up to repeated use by us, but for our 30lb toddler, it's perfect. She started sleeping on it the very first night - no transition period. I was surprised.

A second box spring under it would make it taller and stable if you have the ""slat style"" bed frame (like I did), so, not having a box spring, I had to support each slat with additional pieces of lumber in random places.

I can say that many of the negative reviews are flat out wrong. I've only had this mattress a week now so time will really tell how well it performs. I really liked the way it came compressed and it popped up like it should. It is actually very firm when laying on it which I personally prefer but can see how it can be too firm for some.

There is one tip for new purchases: you will need at least two people to set up this mattress. It comes shrink-wrapped inside another bag inside of a box. There is nothing on the box or either bag to tell you how to orient the mattress on the bed. Once you remove the outer bag, it will start inflating, even with the inner bag still on. If you've guessed wrong and need to turn the mattress, it quickly become cumbersome if you're doing it by yourself. Make sure the mattress is correctly positioned before removing the final wrapping.",4 out of 5 stars review

But once I got the packaging off and air was let into the bag it was covered with, it expanded into a normal king sized mattress. And after laying on it, I was definitely satisfied. I didn't rate it a full 5/5 because of the little heart attack I had when I saw the box.",4 out of 5 stars review

7/6/2014,"I really needed a new mattress and thought about this a lot. I finally ordered it as for me it was easy to have it shipped rather than go to another dealer and also pay a delivery charge. I received it on time. Although, it was heavy, I managed to work with it, with the weight, you may want to have someone help you. Once I completed setting it up, it was like a miracle when I laid on it. It was so comfortable. I was very happy I had made the right choice. I love the warranty. I would recommend this to anyone with no hesitation.",4 out of 5 stars review
9/13/2014,The first night sleeping on mattress felt like coils were poking me in my back. My wife had no issues with her side of mattress. She was tossing and turning throughout the night on old 13yr old mattress. I remembered we did not wait the whole 48 hours maybe 24 hours that they say for mattress to unfold fully. The days after that it felt much better too me. I also had my wife purchase mattress topper 2 inch from Walmart and it feels even better with it on top. I would recommend this but make sure you do what the instructions tell you to do as far as the amount of hours before use.,4 out of 5 stars review
9/2/2022,"The box was a little torn up, but nothing was wrong with the mattress. I purchased a Queen mattress but it's smaller than my queen-sized frame, so I don't think the measurements on the description are right. It's still bigger than a full though.  I've had this mattress for about a week now and it's comfortable but, a little stiff for me though.",4 out of 5 stars review
11/30/2013,"The bed is good for the price. The only real complaint I have is that it is hard to put a sheet on it if you have the bed against the wall. When you pick up on the mattress it fold in half from where it had been previously boxed. It wont hold its shape when you lift up on it, making it difficult to put sheets on. It holds its shape good when lying down though and is very comfortable. Overall a minor complaint for the price and I have no regrets over the purchase.",4 out of 5 stars review
2/22/2013,"The price was great and I got free shipping, even better. The fact that I could put it on bed and let it open up was really cool. So far I am sleeping very well on it and It is comfy, maybe a little too soft for my back but will give it more time to get use to it. I dont think that you can sleep on a mattress for a few nights and rule that it is perfect for you or not. So far I really like it, hope this helps.",4 out of 5 stars review
7/6/2014,"Great Price!!!!-bought 2 based on reviews here for my children12&14 85&115 pounds respectively. Setup is with wooden slats and bunkie board.

SuperFast Delivery- beat expectations on delivery-Ordered Wednesday arrived next day with regular delivery!! (1box torn up but no damage to bed)

Amazing ease of use- carried box up flight of stairs since in box easy to maneuver.

Bed soft and cuddly with some firmness-Children love it!!

Some things that concern me--it's states firm but to me bed is Not Firm( I sleep in a firm mattress). I think like other reviews if you are 250 lb or more this bed will start sinking. I am 190 lbs and I feel that after time it will sink. I would think twice as an adult >200lb buying this for everyday use.

Overall: f...",4 out of 5 stars review
9/7/2014,I have only slept on the mattress 1 day so far and it is very comfortable. It is firm but has some give. It is the perfect size twin for my small room.

7/7/2014,"We bought this mattress for our guest bedroom. Our 20 yr niece is spending the summer with us and has slept on it for a month. She says it's very comfortable although she is using a memory foam topper and only weighs 120 lbs. I laid on it when we received it and it was very comfy. I wouldn't use it as my main mattress but, I think it's good for a guest room or kids room. It was really neat the way it just pops out of packaging and becomes a mattress!",4 out of 5 stars review
3/26/2021,"It's an okay mattress for an online purchase.  It is pretty comfortable, but very flimsy. Unless you plan on using an actual platform bed, you will need a box spring with the mattress, especially if your bed frame has wooden slats to hold the mattress up.",4 out of 5 stars review

6/20/2013,"So i recently moved to a new town and needed a mattress on the cheap that I could use for a couple years and then toss... even the cheapest coil-spring mattresses at the stores are a bit pricier (and I despise the whole haggling back and forth with the salesman - worse than buying a used car). After reading the scores of great reviews I decided to try this thing out. It did arrive timely and in a box! The box was pretty heavy...maybe 70 lbs or so. It fit in the back seat of my camry...thats a plus because then i didnt need to borrow a truck.

11/30/2013,"I was a little worried this 2 in 1 type mattress would not be comfortable for sleeping but I read the other reviews and most were satisfied with it.
I am a small, light weight person (118 lb) so I am not sure how it would sleep for a larger size person but for me it is ideal. I also wanted something to have as a guest bed for family when they visit, and this has worked out well.

6/28/2021,"I was looking for guest bed mattresses used mainly by grandkids but sometimes adults and I didn't want foam that, in my experience, leaves an imprint after a while. The 8"" spring mattresses arrived within 24 hours, unwrapped easily, and popped into size  correctly. The fabric is soft and appears to be decent quality and the mattresses are well made. They are  quite firm except for along the edges and I would anticipate they might break down after a while if there was frequent sitting on the side of the beds. I already had 1"" foam toppers I used on the previous mattresses and they help soften these new mattresses so I think my guests will be comfy. I am pleased with the purchase, the price, the quality, and the ease of online ordering.",4 out of 5 stars review
3/31/2013,"I read through many reviews before buying this mattress. Most reviews were good, though there are a smaller percentage of bad reviews.
My main concern was getting the mattress and hating it. Would I be able to throw the mattress in a truck, bring to Walmart, and get a refund? After being reassured this was the case I went ahead and bought it.
My old mattress was killing my back. I have slept on this mattress for three weeks and have slept comfortably and my back feels much better. It was set up easily.
My only concern going forward is how long it lasts. If it lasts 5 years I will be happy. If it starts to sink in after a year I will be disappointed. Only time will tell.

1/15/2014,"Indeed. The box really doesn't ruin it. It really does ""inflate"" and regain it's normal shape and isn't all wonky. Of course it's still a mattress for under $200 and it's not some plush pillow top, but it's just fine quality, and especially when coupled with a mattress topper (memory foam for me) it's more than comfortable. Time will tell of course how well the mattress stands up over the long-term, but again- not expecting a lifetime of sleeping on this anyway. Very happy with my purchase.",4 out of 5 stars review
12/19/2013,"We bought these mattresses to move our toddlers into big-kid beds, and it was perfect for a first mattress. We were amazed at how they come packaged - rolled up and compressed in a box and were dubious that they would actually be a substantial mattress, but were pleasantly surprised!

My only complaint to date - the description of the mattress indicates that it works with a platform bed. This means a solid platform base, not bed slats like many other platform beds. We initially bought bed slats and realized very quickly that they wouldn't work as we were setting up the beds. I ended up having to run out and buy twin box springs at the last minute",4 out of 5 stars review
9/1/2014,"This bed would be ok if you were on a tight budget. I would not say that it was firm, but not soft either. Somewhere in the middle. This bed will serve its purpose, but if you want the best mattress around, you should go to a mattress store, and pay much more of course. Recommended for its price and comfortable feeling. Don't think it will hold up for 10 years however.",4 out of 5 stars review

He only let us lay on it for a few minutes but I am definitely going to buy the king size for my bed.  It is firm, which is what I want because our bed is too plush.

The box easily fit in my trunk, and after unpacking my mattress, it immediately sprung into shape, and was ready to go within a day.  It is just as comfortable as a furniture store mattress.  I bought the king size frame with the mattress using Walmart's bundle deal and ended up with a king size bed for less than $300 total!  I bought a memory foam cover to make it even more comfortable, and am really enjoying my new bed!",4 out of 5 stars review

The box was small but heavyweight I was skeptical of how can a mattress be compressed in a box expand into a full size bed be comfortable?  Once open we could here it literally expand into a full size mattress! Also a few minor tear in material on the bottom side of the matress. We can't wait to start using the bed. Instructions are to let it air out and take grow into its full potential for 24 to 48 hrs. Hopefully it's as soft as it feels. If not we already have a gel foam matress pad. So far so good. Overall satified with the purchase.",4 out of 5 stars review

We have pets, so I was particularly excited, because of it being infused with green tea, seed oil and charcoal. Hoping it would help keep the mattress fresh. Our daybed does see a lot. It sees a lot of heavy use, so time will tell. We have it in our living room and often use to watch t.v. Many times there is at least one adult, along with a large dog or two (over 100lbs).

I was highly suspicious when the mattress was delivered and hesitated to open it for a few days. They compressed it and rolled it for better shipping. Pretty cool if I may say so myself

In the main product description, not videos or extra links or anything beyond what is printed right there in the specifications and such, there is no mention that it is recommended to allow the mattress a day or two to fully fill out. Unfortunately I was going to have to sleep on it that night as my other bed had been removed. It had a few hours to do its thing before I made the bed and over 12 before I slept.

I compared the measurements listed here to the frame measurements, and that of the mattress protectors I was intending to use prior to ordering the mattress.

Only setback is both mattress and foam top have very strong chemical smell and hard to sleep on for a week because of it. If you dont need to sleep on it right away let it air out uncovered for a week .
