11/16/2023,"This is honestly the hardest mattress I can ever remember sleeping on. Ever! I ordered it because the plush-medium mattress in a box I also ordered from Walmart a couple of years ago (which I loved) was out of stock and I needed something ASAP-and it was all I could afford at that moment. At first it seemed alright, like something I could tolerate for a few months, but as the *month* wore on, so did the tightness of this mattress! It literally feels like we're sleeping on a board! I wake up with a sore back and side almost every day! If you are looking for a mattress that has very little give and is extremely tight, then this is for you! But, if  not...keep looking!",2 out of 5 stars review
1/31/2013,"it was a strange, otherworldly experience opening this box with a mattress in it. it was more than vacume packed, was easy to open, seemed packaged well and was entertained watching it grow like one of those toy sea monkeys in a container. inner springs seems comfortable enough, though do not feel as sturdy as a standard twin mattress, works fine for my very light weight 8 year old, so for now and then next 3-5 years or so, i think it will suffice.",2 out of 5 stars review
9/15/2023,"The mattress is pretty firm and it's easy to tell will only last a year due to cheap materials. The mattress comes vacuum sealed, tightly wrapped in plastic, in a box, in another box.

10/21/2023,"Love the bed in a box concept, loved the sale price of $70… however it's not a good mattress. You get what you pay for. Will be using in a guest room as soon as I get a better one for myself. If I paid any more money for it I'd go through the hassle of returning it. 
Super soft, I can feel the hybrid coils, dang near sink to the bottom and I'm average sized. Way too soft and squishy in my opinion. Provides zero support.",2 out of 5 stars review
3/11/2017,The mattress came vacuum sealed. Very little to no effort to unwrap it and deflate it! It sleeps nice. True queen sized.  The only con I see is that it is a little too firm for me. I've had it about 2 weeks now and some mornings it doesn't feel like I've slept on a mattress. It feels more like I slept on the floor. I would recommend this mattress to anyone who likes a firm mattress. Since its still fairly new I will wait a while to see if it softens up then I will rate higher. Its the average bang for your buck though.,2 out of 5 stars review
1/20/2017,"I'm sure I put the mattress under some stress at times, but I've never owned a mattress that would sag in the middle this badly after less than 2 years.  I tend to sit on the bed while I'm doing other things and I tend to sit in the same spot... well after a year  to a year and a half,  that resulted in a sagging spot where I would sit which then would cause my back to ache.  

I tried flipping the mattress over in case that would help but it felt worse on the other side and didn't do anything about the sagging problem.  It's a decent enough mattress for the first year but starts to wear down after that.",2 out of 5 stars review
1/6/2014,"Opening the mattress was a lot of fun -- it does explode and then suck in the air like some strange life form. It's decently comfortable, though not as firm as I would've liked (especially around the edges). But it has one fatal flaw: it's too small. I bought a queen, which is supposed to be 60 inches wide, but the mattress is only 58 inches wide. This might not seem like a big deal, but it means that fitted sheets sag, and the bed frame sticks out a shin-destroying inch on either side. It's really a shame because otherwise it's a pretty decent mattress, and enticingly cheap too.",2 out of 5 stars review
1/7/2014,"I bought a queen for my mom, but only a few days later she started having body aches after waking up. You can even feel the springs inside the mattress. Finally, she decided to go back to the traditional pillow top mattress.

2/4/2014,"The Slumber bed appearance was great, packaging & shipping was easy, the mattress fully opened up in about 20 mins. However I would not recommend the mattress for every day use, because I can feel the mattress springs and its uncomfortable.

7/5/2016,"I bought it based on the good reviews
The mattress is not so firm as it is supposed to hold your back
I am  180lbs, and it does not have much support.
If I sit on it, I sink, it smashes down, The springs are too weak.
Mattress is too soft on the sides, no edge support .
If you're looking for firmness, this product is not for you.
Invest in something better quality",2 out of 5 stars review
4/14/2020,I absolutely love the Fast delivery. Mattress is true to size very big . Fit for a queen size headboard.  But the only issue is that it sinks soon as I laid down on the mattress it started to sink in .  I'm awaiting a box spring maybe that'll stop it from sinking in . But It doesn't support your back . Wouldn't recommend to someone with back problems. Other then the sinking I love it .,2 out of 5 stars review
3/22/2014,"I try to read reviews myself before I purchase an item. After reading the reviews on this product it seemed like a great value. It looks awesome just like a real mattress. The only thing is that it is like an air mattress. When one person is on it and another sits on it, it fold in on itself, and when you get on or off it or sit on it it ""sinks"" where you are sitting. It's only comfy when your lying down and when you move it moves with you. I really wish I had spent the extra $60 and gotten the beauty rest mattress that Walmart has for $199. My daughter seems to like it but all her sheets and blankets fall off it daily and has become a hassle to make it again everyday. My advise is spend the extra $ and get a real mattress.

6/29/2016,"I purchased this mattress based on good reviews by other purchasers. I bought 2 twin mattress & they have little to no support. I weigh 141 lbs, so it shouldn't sag in the middle with my body weight. This might be ok for small children, but I would advise against it for teens or adults. Once it is opened, there is no way to get the mattress back in the box. If I could have returned it, I would have. I just can't figure out why it got good reviews & people described it as somewhat firm. It is exactly the opposite. Everyone who has tried it, has had the same opinion.",2 out of 5 stars review
9/25/2014,"I saw all the reviews and even watched youtube videos reviewing this bed...
I was excited about it, it was packaged nicely and I opened it a day after it arrived.
It honestly sucks. The mattress is poor quality, it looks really nice and clean and soft
but when you lay on it the springs on the bed are kinda flimsy and you can hear them
uncoil during the night! I don't know how that happens but it does.. But what do you
expect for the price, I mean its a mattress in a box. Honestly just save your money
and invest in a better quality mattress it'll save you the back pain and disappointment.
Trust me.",2 out of 5 stars review
8/19/2013,"i prefer a bit harder matress to keep my posture, like futon style. I avoided memory foam matress because I dislike sleeping on a spongy type of matress. So I chose this product, hoping to get a harder, firm matress. When I received this matress at home through online, I was disappointed to see the matress and its packaging. The matress was holded in half and wrapped. Holding half means this matress is made with soft materials! I had never seen any other good matresses being hooded in half. Ever since I started to sleep on this matress I even wake up middle of nights because it is too soft and uncomfortable to roll my body and change positions. It is like air matresses. I am disappointed with this purchase and this is not how I expected.",2 out of 5 stars review

3/26/2019,I bought this mattress based on the reviews because I was looking for something affordable and comfy but the first night we slept on it was not something I expected when I got up and stood on the other side of my room I could see our body prints that later turned into deep pockets that never went away I thought the material would rise back up with time and it would go away but it never did! its uncomfortable I stopped sleeping on it.

There exists many uncertain things about this mattress. If you are lucky, you can get a good one.",2 out of 5 stars review
4/1/2013,I purchased this product because the reviews was good and the price was great but when i received it and placed it on top my box spring i realized that it was way smaller than my last mattress and had me feeling like my mattress was missing. After laying on the mattress for a day i knew it was way to uncomfortable for me to keep but my husband convinced me to purchase a 3inch mattress pad for 150 dollars but it just made it worse. So i finally decided to return both and go purchase a real mattress. The product is great for the price if u are not accustomed to a thicker higher bed. Otherwise just buy a regular mattress it will save you moneyon buying a mattress pad.,2 out of 5 stars review

6/2/2014,"I am sorry to say, I am disappointed in this mattress. I purchased it after reading rave reviews on your website about it, I have to wonder if any of these people actually slept on this bed. I guess maybe for a spare room, or extra bed in case of company it might do in a pinch, BUT for every night use, no not so much. I waited a month after I purchased and used it, to review the bed, to make sure of how it slept. Just wish I had looked elsewhere before purchasing. A disappointment for the money I spent. Uncomfortable, and gets a indention of where I sleep after several hours. I am not a big person, a small frame woman, so was shocked when this started happening.

But as soon as I sat on it, I knew it was one of those mistakes you are NOT able to make correction easily. Obviously it'd be another mistake to return, go figure! The mattress has absolutely no support whatsoever. I felt like sinking to the bottom, and I am 5'8, weigh around 140 Ibs. There is NO density, NO reinforce, NO endurance and NO firmness... If you need support, stay away from it. Its inexpensive, but a waste of money when it wont live up to your expectations.",2 out of 5 stars review

The shipping was quick. The bed expanded to over 8"" which I had read happening in the reviews so I was happy about that. There wasn't any odor to the bed at all, but maybe that was because we opened it right away and let it expand and air out for 2 full days. I really wanted to like this bed but it wasn't very comfortable for any of us to lay on.

12/24/2011,"I bought this mattress based on all the good reviews I read. The site to store option was very convenient which is the main reason I bought it. However, the mattress itself is thinner than 8"" and is too firm. I have it situated on a platform bed I also bought at walmart and the two together make sleeping a crummy experience. My back is a mess now. I'm going to try to buy a feather top for it to see if that'll help, but this bed is not worth the money in any way. And it didn't save me money either since I now have to buy a feather mattress topper.

1/13/2012,I bought this mattress solely based on the good reviews. I was totally wrong. Now I had doubts about the reviews being genuine or paid reviews. It came in a box which was handy. It inflated into the shape easily after opening the package. The quality of the mattress was sub-par. There was no edge support at all. The springs are way too weak. I believe they are made of thinnest possible gauge wire. When I sat on it I could feel the springs had not necessary support. Also strong chemical smell lingered many days. It may have been from manufacturing process. Overall I would not recommend this product anyone.,2 out of 5 stars review

Now it's taking me weeks to get my refund and also having to take tie off work to coordinate with the freight company sent to pick up my item which takes them days to pick up.

5/3/2016,"I decided to give this brand a shot because it was a lower price than another ""mattress in a box"" that I previously had (and very comfortable). I figured thousands of 5-star reviews would give me a good idea and help my decision in getting this one.

Once I received the mattress and set it up, I thought it was just ""ok"". Not as comfy as my previous one, but seemed like it'd do the job. I just was never comfortable in it. It wasn't as supportive as I expected. And the edges started getting crushed downward probably after about 6 months. I'm only 170 lbs. Once in a while I'll feel a spring go ""clunk"". Not sure what that really is, though.

I'll go an try another brand after I get rid of this one. Sorry, but I don't recommend this to anyone.",2 out of 5 stars review

You can return to any Wal-Mart and no need to ship back and I highly recommend this option as this is what I just did. Never again will I purchase a mattress online with out seeing it in person.

All that to say, I now have chronic back issues due to this mattress. It is not comfortable enough for daily use. If you were to use this in a guest room or for your dog to sleep on, it would be great. But for regular people, go with something else.

My spouse which is a back sleeper also says it is extremely firm but does not feel the coils.

It was very comfortable and had just the right amount of firmness. At this point though, I can feel where almost every spring is. Whatever the padding is that surrounds the springs seems to have slowly separated into clumpy bits - which I believe is why I can feel the springs. It's really been hurting my back and has lost a good amount of its firmness. I've only kept with it for the past few months because I needed to save up money to get a better bed.

6/24/2020,Was supposed to be extra firm but not even medium in fitness. Can't use it. Can't return it as the instructions required 48hrs to allow complete reinflation and the box was tossed out before that 48hrs was over.  Now I have this soft bed taking up space,2 out of 5 stars review
12/31/2017,"This mattress had great reviews that sucked me in, especially for the price. I was so excited to get it and the 2 Days we waited for it to reach full size were filled with great anticipation. My husband was skeptical and I had full faith hat it would meet my expectations. Well, sad to say my husband was right and it's super uncomfortable. It's hard and my back hurts all night sleeping on this mattress. I wake up multiple times per night and am so disappointed. My 3 year old won't sleep on it because she says it's
Too hard, my sister and brother in law both slept on it one night and then decided to sleep on an air mattress in the playroom instead. I guess I should have listened to my husband...Perhaps a memory foam mattress topper with salva...",2 out of 5 stars review

9/19/2017,It feels like a blow mattress that you have to pump air in.  You will need extra cushion for this type of mattress in a box.  A really nice mattress pad would help it out greatly.,2 out of 5 stars review

4/21/2022,This one definitely missed the mark. Waaaay too soft; the kind of soft where you sink straight through the mattress as though there's no support at all. Would not buy again; would've returned if I'd kept the box.,2 out of 5 stars review

8/12/2015,After reading the reviews I really though I was getting a bargain....this mattress literally folds in half while you're holding it & is super flimsy. There is no way this could be used without a box spring. I'm not quite sure it's even a real king size because it doesn't fit completely in the bed frame. Really disappointed with this purchase :-(,2 out of 5 stars review
12/29/2016,"The price of this mattress was a great deal for us. I bought this mattress for my son last year, he has a bad habit of jumping and flopping on his bed which caused the middle of the mattress to sink in drastically. The springs in the mattress were not strong enough to hold up to a 46 lbs child after 5 months. I would assume an adult who is a sound sleeper would have no problems with this mattress and could possibly even last them years. Bouncy children though would be out of the question.",2 out of 5 stars review
2/26/2015,"To be fair, i never opened the medium sized box that held the mattress. I returned it to the store. I knew i needed something more substantial. I was expecting a traditional coiled spring mattress. This may be perfect for a guest room but not for your main sleeping mattress.",2 out of 5 stars review
9/7/2015,"Some of the holes that were pre-drilled were placed wrong. By the time we realized it, it was too late too late to start over. We had to get our own 2x4's to reinforce it. Also, I thought I was buying a normal twin size mattress to fit the bed. The mattress is a lil small and now you can see some of the unfinished wood. It's very unpleasant to look at.",2 out of 5 stars review
3/9/2012,"Much smaller than a full size mattress. Too much of a hassle to return so we built a platform to keep the mattress from falling through the bed frame (only because we had left over building supplies from a remodel) and we have to use flat sheets instead of fitted so the sheet will stay because the fitted is WAY too big. Daughter likes it so it will do for now. I have to say it is a comfortable mattress, just wish it was the right size. If you want a full maybe order a queen instead?",2 out of 5 stars review
7/12/2015,"this was my quick and very recent purchase for my mother (who is about 4'10"" and 180#'s) but in my opinion mattress is too soft , maybe okay for a kid or more likely for an overnight guest, definitely not for an adult to use every day (which was my intention). So, my prediction is that it will be short lived (hopefully a year) and if that will turn out wrong - I will write about it.... In conclusion, the very best way to sleep to avoid any spine problems such as scoliosis for example, is on the floor....but obviously many will disagree (including me) for various reasons :)",2 out of 5 stars review
7/17/2015,The picture is deceptive . It appears to be a box spring mattress combo it is not . It comes rolled up in a box not what I expected after viewing the details it appears to be a box spring and coil spring mattress top all in one. I bought two of these for the platform beds I bought for my sons won't work without another stabilizer.,2 out of 5 stars review
