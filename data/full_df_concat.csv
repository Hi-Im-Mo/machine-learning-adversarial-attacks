2/7/2024,"Unfortunately the tv fell on me after purchasing it and having it professionally mounted by Walmart and they basically said that they couldn't refund me or help me with bodily injury

They also said I booked the mounting service with third party provider and take it up with them basically was the response i got",1
11/1/2023,"I love Vizio that’s always my go to brand I have always loved their products, after buying this Television I will be looking into other brands. The Tv won’t hook up to the internet and just won’t turn on some days, I have to unplug them plug back in to get the tv to turn on. Picture quality it great, I might have just gotten a dud",1
11/22/2023,"I ordered a Vizio 50"" Class V-Series 4L UHD LED TV on the Walmart Website on Nov 14th.  On Nov 16th I received a confirmation that the TV was delivered.  IT WAS NOT.  I have been battling with Walmart ever since.  It is false advertisement and BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE by Walmart when they do not stand by their products that they sell on their website.  Even if it is shipped by the third-party seller.  Walmart should HONOR the sell and ship a replacement item to the customer.  Walmart STILL has the item on thier website and will not ship me a replacement.  Walmart has partnered with the third party sell and should stand by Walmart's commitment to service the customer.  I specifically told several people that I did NOT want a refund and that I wa...",1
12/5/2023,"It didn't work right out of the box. Nothing but vertical and a few horizontal lines. Vizio said it was bad and needed to be replaced by Walmart said I can only return for refund even though they do have a replacement at the store close to me. They delivered it and I had friends set it up since I just had surgery so for me to take apart, rebox and take this 70 inch TV back to the store in my Prius is asking too much. Plus I'll have to deal with the installation of the replacement . Now I've seen people complain about how long it takes Walmart to process refunds and that also isn't fair. According to the promised warranty paperwork that came with the TV Vizio said for TV's over 50 inches they send service people out to fix it, but when I cal...",1
12/24/2023,"I ordered  75” Vizio TV and just put it up, but there is damage to the inside of the TV. It was never dropped, and this (see attachment) is what I found when I took off the cardboard protection. I never received an invoice for this product. The only invoice I have is from PayPal, nothing from Walmart. I did purchase a four-year warranty, item %23 18760A2076554307ACB56ACA99741A2F
Please advise.
Thank you.",1
12/2/2023,"Bought the 65inch Vizio online and it arrived from FedEx with one plastic strap and coming through the bottom of the box and low and behold once i pulled the tv out it was damaged. On top of that trying to call my local walmart in Woodhaven,MI to see what i can do about it and im being transferred to their online order and pickup department  just to be hung up on after waiting for them to pickup 6 times in a row.... So disappointed only one star because its required it would be none if i could.",1
9/7/2023,"From the moment the TV arrived, albeit quickly, within 24hrs, I had a feeling it wasn't our best purchase.  Driver shows up and says “ I dont see how they expect one guy to deliver this thing - come get it “.  To then notice the TV was hauled laid flat in a truck bed- big no no, says right on box in images to haul vertically ONLY. 
The resolution of the TV seems subpar to expectations.  Our old TCL TV we replaced with this one was about five years old and had a  much better picture. 
Games played through xbox are super bright or blurred by poor res.
If this hadnt been our third, yes third! new TV in as many weeks, first one cracked screen, second had a line in picture(both from another store and different brand so thought, lets try somewher...",1
8/4/2023,Ordered a 75 inch television as soon as the driver dropped it off took it straight in the house took pictures of the box because it was damaged really bad and then took the TV out and the whole screen has been cracked and lines all down the screen.  looks like it was throw out the back of the truck. I see why shipping Was so fast now.,1
8/11/2023,"Came broken, still waiting on refund. Took forever for them to come back to pick it up for the return. Didn't come the first pick up date we scheduled. Then didn't come second time. Ended up getting a text from the guy to schedule a different pickup day and time in which they finally came. Pick up Guy was nice. Just frustrated  with this experience. Delivered via Pilot and picked back up via pilot.",1
10/22/2023,"If you buy a TV Get it from the store and don't choose the delivery option. 
First, the date was sent with a tracking number and they delivered on a different day.  Second, they left the unit on my driveway in the middle of the day and I did not receive a message until the end of the day for the delivery. Third, the box has a big hole on the front part of the box looks like a forklift or pallet jack shape hit the box. Fourth, I opened the box to examine the unit and surprise!!! The screen was cracked where the hole in the box was, still waiting for my refund after a week of the return.",1
10/14/2023,The tv was broke the delivery person wasn't able to handle it I have the delivery on ring and the pick up along with picks of the broken tv  and Walmart have yet to refund my money or replace the tv it will be 4 weeks next week. I keep getting messages to review the product but no resolve,1
9/13/2023,"I'm a bit disappointed that I have to wait 48 hrs before I can report that my purchase was not delivered even after being alerted that it was delivered. I have never had to report on a missing delivery so navagating this process isn't easy. 
I would also suggest that delivery notifications come with a picture of package delivered as other delivery services do. 
In this instance it appears that my package went back to be inspected for some reason but it doesn't say that it went out to be delivered again yet it does say it was left at my door.",1
10/11/2023,"I've always been a huge fan of Vizio TVs for years, so recently needed a new one and purchased this one bc I'm committed to brand loyalty. First one I received was used (power cord was still plugged in the TV) and the screen was shattered. Went through the trouble of returning it to Walmart, then decided to get the same brand/series. Now, the second one has network connectivity issues even though my router is only 10 feet from the TV.  This happens about every 20-30 minutes, in the middle of whatever I'm watching, and won't reconnect for 5-10 minutes. No other device in my home has this issue, so I know it is not my wifi. Such a pain! Will be returning this TV and switching brands!",1
9/26/2023,"This is my second time within the last month and a half that I have a screen problem. Right out of the box I had dead spots on the top left corner of my screen. They are visible when there is a white or light background. I been through TCL and Vizio with the same problem. I have no idea if it is from handling the product, or a manufacturer defect. I even gave the benefit of the doubt that the screen would fix itself. This process has been frustrating to say the least. I just want a quality product and enjoy a tv.",1
12/30/2023,"Aside from the home not being available in my country. Using the buttons from the remote to open up Netflix is useless. I can click the button 100 times and it would not open up Netflix until it wants to. I usually have to turn the tv off and on for it to work. Also, sometimes the screen completely blanks out on me for no reason at all. I’m unable to do anything with it. Even using the microphone button on the remote does not work for me. Not happy with this at all!",1
12/17/2023,Order left outside in the rain propped up sideways. Hopefully it will still function properly when it is set up simple knock on the door would've had it unloaded for you and brought inside out of the elements,1
11/11/2023,I received a used tv. Really disappointed. Screen cracked and spotty. A person's Netflix was signed in and all! On the box stated reduced rate. I payed full price for this TV. I returned it have to keep shopping around.,1
12/18/2023,I bought this on Black Friday and it came with foot prints all over it and the whole screen was busted.  I spoke to a customer service rep and they said they'd refund it but I haven't received anything for it.,1
11/25/2023,Unpackaged tv as per the Instructions. And once I turned it on the screen said Vizio then turned white with a black bar on the left side of the screen,1
12/13/2023,"I have never had any other brand TVs besides Vizio. The left side has stripes from top to bottom, the right top hand corner is blotchy, not to mention the volume is WAY too loud but then you can't hear it so you keep having to adjust the volume. I bought this 7 months ago. Disappointed would be an understatement",1
7/23/2023,When it come to appliance Walmart is not good to order . I ordered a 65 inch came shattered sent it back they sent me the same tv same box shattered not good Walmart,1
10/7/2023,How do I return a broken tv? I bought extended warranty and was setting up for cable man to hook up tomorrow and screen is busted! Box is gone. Now what?,1
5/12/2023,"Dislike totally, the TVs comes from third party , the box Comes open and with tape around the box inside looks tv used I send email to third party because for my information when I try to return in the store they told me that need to be with the third party retail, I bought online in walmart
App and I not know  that's was third party when I send email they just said returns me $50 for
My satisfaction and that's and I said

5/23/2023,"Disapointing purchase
I have owned 2 other Vizio tv's that gave us 10 years of service ..... but this one is a disaster
It started giving a flashing bar at the bottom .... followed by lines across the center of the screen 
Started at about 7 months of use and now it is about to go out ......
Not sure what to do with this thing",1
4/30/2023,I had this tv for two months then lines started showing up and after having it for only 5 months I got to turn it on and the tv was grey with multiple lines thankfully Vizio did have a warranty so we'll be able to get a new one but it's that's not something you want to do then do NOT waste time buying this tv,1
9/19/2023,"I was left in the front of the house….upside down and a damp concrete!
Customer service said they would send another one AND THEN TAKE THIS ONE BACK.
The appointment was right on time by himself, poor guy.
He was only the delivery service.
He apologized that he was only told it was a PICK UP.",1
12/31/2023,"Was excited to get this tv after reading the reviews / spending years without one. 

Unfortunately, the tv (which was dropped on the porch without a signature or even a knock) arrived damaged. The photo attached is from the first 30 minutes of use and the entire right side of the screen has degraded in the weeks since. What a waste of money. 

Walmart doesn’t have the option to speak with a representative to resolve, only a chatbot that talks you in circles without any customer support. Please offer a refund for damaged goods - or easy option for replacement of faulty merchandise!",1
7/15/2023,Will not connect to the Wi-Fi. I have to reconfigure the piece of crap EVERY time I turn the TV on. Waste of time and waste of money,1
2/14/2024,"I bought this TV and when it got delivered the screen was shattered.  There was no remote, power cord or legs.  I immediately let them know and was told to take it back to any Wal Mart store with bar code sent as receipt for refund by March 3.  I took it back and was told they would not except it because I did not buy it from that store.  The guy I was dealing with Ryan was the most rude unhelpful excuse of a manager and should be demoted to stock boy.  Then I get in touch with someone from the on line side of things and nothing works and he really cannot help and it would be 48 hours before problems would be fixed and 72 hours later and nothing.  He did tell me I would most likely have to take it to a fed ex to return but he was not real s...",1
11/27/2023,Two weeks and a line appeared across the screen now I have to watch it like that it's crap,1

9/10/2023,"Box came with a hole in it. I did not worry about it, because the screen was not cracked but as soon as I plugged it in, it was definitely broken.",1
8/10/2023,This is how my TV arrived. I got a refund but have to first box it up and set up a pickup what an inconvenience for me. Very disappointing.,1
12/30/2022,"TV worked great when i got it in march, then around September the display had random lines on it, it started to glitch out on me and started to flicker on and off. This is 6 months after getting the tv, now its essentially a 50 inch tv shaped paperweight that works sometimes. The worst part of all is that the tv I got was a gift and since i dont have the receipt for it vizo won't honor the warranty meaning i cant even get it replaced. I highly recommend that if you get this tv then please be wary, and keep the receipt for it if you can.",1
12/14/2021,"tv arrived quickly ,,(only one man truck)delivered it.   let tv sit in house 24 hours before unpacking and pluging it in.... the tv setup and worked for about 12 hours then started scan lines over the 2/3 of the picture ...Not all channels in watch free  did not work about 50 to 60% have lines over the picture...",1
2/24/2023,"I’ve had 2 of the same TV’s in the last year. The first tv stopped working after a few months, the display was not operable. Returned for a tv of the same brand size and series, it’s lasted about 6-8 month and have already developed lines across the tv so it’ll die any day now.",1
11/1/2022,"our tv did not come with a remote, we spent 2 hours on the phone to be hung up on then started a chat with someone that said someone else would come on and that never happened either! ill never purchase from Walmart online again! now we have a tv that we cant watch! great $800 not well spent!!",1
11/11/2022,"Worst TV ever. Every time I want to stream YouTube or videos from my phone it won’t work. Complete waste of money! I can’t even use my TV! I highly recommend looking into another item as this TV has caused problems since I got it. In multiple occasions when I use apps like HBO, Netflix, or the freeTV service it provides, the only thing that will show is a black screen! I have never written a review before on Walmart but I would like to save anyone else the trouble than to purchase this item.",1
10/14/2022,"If I could give this 0 stars I would. My previous tv was a Vizio and it has work beautifully for 10 years. This is why when I decided to get a new tv with a larger screen I got another Vizio. But this is a piece of junk. It work perfect for about  9 months. Now when it does turn on it has a 6” strip down the middle that is all messed up and white dotted light that run across the screen. I have never left a review on an item before but this is ridiculous, a $400 tv should work for more than 9 months. I used to trust Vizio's products but not any more. So mad and disappointed.",1
3/29/2023,Over.    Would not help.  Don’t buy anything unless you use right away.,1

2/10/2024,"Shipped and arrived on time however tv was destroyed. Shipped in only original retail box, no extra packing or protection.   Lesson learned.",1
12/17/2023,I bought the 50” Vizio tv on November 9th. It stopped working on December the 12th and Walmart refused to even give me store credit. This does not make me a happy camper. Just avoid them so you don’t get stuck with a piece of junk,1
1/20/2024,Carton was damaged. TV was damaged upon power up.,1
5/15/2023,TV arrived broken after i specifically wrote in the delivery description to handle items CAREFULLY. The screen is cracked.,1

12/27/2021,I bought this tv for my daughter for Christmas…when she opened the box the tv was dirty..the remote had a slimy substance on it and the legs that came with it were the wrong ones….I was so impressed……….I  could tell it had been rewrapped..,1
2/5/2023,I bought this TV in June 2022 and already has streaks and lines running through it with  a purple tint. It’s crazy to pay this much for something and not even last 1 year. My advice “buyer beware “!,1
9/23/2022,Flashed green since day 1 and finally today it was unresolvable. I would highly recommend NOT getting this TV and avoiding it at all costs. Waste of $300,1
7/14/2022,Unfortunately the TV is awesome but the delivery of it broke the screen on the right side. So I returned it. And went with Target purchase in stock for a 65in unfortunately,1
2/3/2023,"Do not buy. It worked fine after a couple of months, and that was it. The screen goes dark, and it glitches. So the worst TV ever. We go to two same Visio, And they are both acting up. I wish I could give it a zero star.",1

7/16/2023,"What a waste of time, now I have to go to the store to retuned. My one star is not because of the actual tv. I have a Vizio and I really like it. 

This is not a 50” tv like this says, once you take it out and measure it is about 45”. I have one the size but I didn’t remember what size it was cause I got it a long time ago. So if you want something that is a actually 50” get the 55”, if you want a 60” get the 65”. They all are probably gonna be 5” less in size. Now I’m returning this one and getting a bigger one.",1
6/28/2023,"Do not recommend. I had this TV for an about a year when these random horizontal lines appeared one day after a software update. Present day (1 year and 3 months since purchase), the lines have taken over the entire screen (photo attached). Luckily, I purchased the warranty so I’m getting a refund (only for the TV, taxes not included) but I am highly disappointed.

VIZIO has removed this option through rolling automatic updates and replaced it with their Watchfree interface. Unlike any other TV you have ever owned, you can not simply view local channels over the air via antenna input. You are forced to use their sluggish, laggy, and inefficient guide - alternative you can scroll channels up/down if you want to wait several seconds between channels and with no channel number/info displayed, and frequent spinning wheels.

Based on how long this product lasted and based on Vizio's response, I do not recommend you purchase Visio products. There's another company that makes quality products and their stand behind their products.

I will contact Walmart to see if there is anything they can do and I will update this review accordingly.",1
12/29/2023,Please don’t waste your money. I have been a long time customer of Vizio but unfortunately every 2-3 years the TVs stop connecting to the internet and streaming is impossible. I have 2 Vizios that stopped working recently. One from 2015 the other from 2021 😠. I cant believe I continue to waste my money on Vizio. The warranty is only 1 year and after that your on your own. Horrible TV. Buying a different brand. Do not waste your money.,1
8/26/2023,"If I could give a negative star, I would!!! This tv has awful quality! It keeps lagging, doesn't have a lot of apps to download like other tvs do. Even when I try to connect soemthing on my hdmi it won't let me click on the input or it won't even work. I've had this tv for less than a month and I've had to turn it off and unplug it sooo many times!!! So disappointed and I would never buy this brand again!!!",1
9/13/2023,"i will stay away from vizio products now.  netflix app makes the tv crash, unable to even load netflix, all other apps work but no netflix.  ""Watchfree"" app keeps taking over local channels and it takes forever to load... i beleive vizio updated their prodcuts and it only ended up being worse. i tried factory resetting tv, still get a black screen when netflix tries to load... i might of just gotten a bad batch... who knows",1

1/27/2024,I bought this TV in 2021. It has sat in the same place since I bought it about 6 months ago the first line showed up on the screen and now they're everywhere. How does that even happen? Dont buy it.,1

Wanted  a refund at this time . They refused going to send out another reconditioned one. I'm 65 years old I'm having to box up and take both tv back to ups alone.

Now the hassle of maneuvering to fit into my small car %26 back to the store, which is why I wanted it delivered in the first place as to not have this headache. There is an option to have it picked up but I'm not too sure if the TV  could survive the delivery trip back to the store looking at what it looked like upon arrival...",1

2/16/2024,I purchased a 65” Vizio flatscreen.. The tv came and the box was beat up. I opened the box and the tv was used.. had no cord or remote… The tv had scratches on the bottom. I returned it to Walmart in store. They initially did not want to take it back but they ended up doing so. I have still yet to reach anyone about getting a refund on my protection plan..,1
2/13/2024,ordered tv was supposed to be delivered next day. the other items we ordered were delivered but not the tv. store says it was delivered so only conclusion I can come to is that the driver kept the tv. we called the 1-800 number and they told us we had a package being delivered by fedex but when we received it it was only granola bars. called walmart and they said we received it with the rest of the groceries that were delivered the day after we placed the order but could not show us a picture of it being delivered. finally was able to get a ONE TIME refund. only will use in home delivery from now on where an actual employee delivers products.,1
6/25/2023,It was broken,1
2/17/2024,"Shipment supposedly arrived while I was sitting on porch.  FedEx has access to a Great invisibility cloak, so good they avoided my Ring doorbell.  Walmart says I must wait two days, it might show up.  FedEx says my address wasn't on shipping label.  Seller (scammer) conveniently does not answer phone and has no message on answering service.  I'm happy Walmart protects their consumers that trust our purchases are from them and only them.",1
2/4/2024,"The TV keeps shutting off by itself.  You will be watching a show and it will kick you right back out to the home screen. sometimes it takes hours before it works again, I would never buy this model again.

No one would answer phone in the Delivery dept and Driver closed out ticket knowing order was not the complete order. Spoke to 7 different Customer Service reps and not one took accountability. All offered to process refund. This was a surprise gift for my Sis in law and I am the one surprised as she now has a wall mount only and the surprise is foiled. How can Walmart tell me to request refund and REORDER…Why would i trust them on another order when they got this one messed up. Driver should not have closed out ticket because he took pic of the one item he delivered. Go elsewhere if you want Customer Ser...,1
2/12/2024,"I ordered this for next day pick up. All reviews of delivery (of most tvs on Walmart.com) show damage at receipt with little to no resolution from support. I opted to pick up. I ordered it and it showed availability at several locations. I picked one and the next day it informed me that it now wasn't available UNLESS I wanted shipping. I called customer service to where the person argued with me that my card wasn't charged and they immediately cancelled the order. I went on the website, it's still showing pick up today and in stock at the store. Now I have a ten day hold on $300 when I could have just gone to the store myself
To purchase and saved the headache. Do yourself a favor and get this from Target or ANYWHERE else",1
2/5/2024,"This is a review for the third party seller (Itronics). I purchased a 65"" Tv  from Walmart's third party seller Itronics. on the day I was supposed to receive it They e-mailed me and told me my order was canceled do to a delay in shipping.  I would have waited but they gave me no choice. I got a great price on this and I believe this is why they canceled this order. Very poor way to business. Wal-mart should step up and take care of this issue.",1
2/8/2024,"Disliked. Never received TV on delivery day. Called corporate today. The first person said it was still being delivered but delayed. She wanted to know if i wanted a refund.  I explained to her i ordered the TV for 199.99 and now the price was 399.00 but they would refund what i paid and the difference in the price. she explained that i could reorder the T.V. and it would be here tomorrow. 
She put me on hold and then a man picked up. He was rude and told me they wouldn't refund the price for the TV now. They will refund what i paid in 10 days and i would have to pay the difference even though none of this is my fault. Lost money from work to sit and what on it duy to the app said ot was out for delivery.  This morning it changed saying it ...",1
1/24/2024,the tv arrived and the packaging was fine. got it connected and it had large lines down the side. that is a problem with vizio. now i started the return the next day and its been 12 days and still no refund and cannot buy another tv until this one is refunded. i called several times and got absolutly no help. now they gave me a refund date that is more than 2 weeks past the date of delivery. i will never purchase a big ticket item from Walmart again. just waiting for my refund to go to best buy. again Walmart has the worst customer service ever!!!  I wish I couldve picked 0 stars but it forces you to pick at least 1.,1
11/22/2023,The driver was very very rude and cursing at my mother and everything. Also he was complaining about bring the tv up to my apartment like that's what I pay for. Also he said that my tv might be messed up because he didn't have help with the tv. I'm very disappointed and the driver needs to be checked because that wasn't right of him to be using foul language at my mother.,1
11/28/2023,never order anything from walmart.com again bought a TV package online and they sent everything but the tv called and they said they left the TV out and now it was out of stock had to go to another 15 miles away and get the tv then wouldn't sell it to me for the sales price and was told that they would end up paying  more than i orginaly  would have,1
1/19/2024,"We purchased our Vizio 65 inch tv at our Walmart store.  The tv only worked for a little over 2 weeks before the picture went out.  We turned it off and back on but still had no picture, only a lot of verticle colored lines.",1
12/29/2023,The TV was great until a couple of days ago. The audio completely stopped working no matter what we did to try and fix it. It is not worth the trouble of loosing audio after only having it for about a year.,1
6/23/2023,Walmart hired a third party delivery company Spark and they stole my television forged a signature and never delivered. The worst part about is is Walmart never refunded my money or tried to deliver another television. They didn’t even try to contact the driver,1
10/6/2023,This tv stopped working after 3 years. There was no damage to it. The item is simply defective. These VZIO televisions tend to have issues with their back lights shorting out. It's more expensive to fix than to replace. Now all I see when I turn on the tv are multicolored lines!,1
7/4/2023,Got my 50 inch Vizio TV as a present middle of last year and today got like a white screen at the top called customer service but they couldn’t help and out of warranty and this was a present for me now it’s worthless. Do not buy this whatever you do.,1
8/9/2023,My family and I loved this TV when we first got it. The UI was pretty good and the definition held its own against my other tvs.  I had it about a year and a half and all of sudden after updating the screen started malfunctioning. Green lines appeared and would slow down. I updated the software and after doing so the tv became unusable.  I contacted Vizio to troubleshoot  find out my options and they told me there was nothing they could do because the warranty is for a year.  I asked to purchase parts and they told me they wont do that.  I have only bought Vizio tvs and after this I'll have to try a different brand. Maybe this model is a lemon but the experience with the support has pushed me to look elsewhere. If you believe in your produc...,1

9/2/2023,"The 50"" Visio tv was working fine until the one year warranty ran out! It's like it was calendar programed. It started with lines appearing across the screen. Now, the lower half the screen has disappeared!! The extra warranty available is not for newly purchased TVs!! What a waste!",1
8/5/2023,I've bought this tv a little over a year ago first 1 line appeared and I thought it be easier to keep them try to return now it has 5 lines vertical. I don't recommend spending almost $700 on a tv that doesn't even last a year. I've reach out to Visio to see there policy.,1
8/20/2023,"About a year after buying this tv, we started to get random black lines. They were thin and seemed to fade so we dealt with it. Today, in the middle of watching tv, the entire screen went black. It's on, but nothing works. I've turned it off and on several times and nothing. There's been absolutely no damage, it's been sitting in the same spot for the year and a half I've owned it. This is my 2nd Vizio, which replaced an older model that stopped supporting Hulu and various other apps after 3 years. I'll never buy another Vizio again.",1
3/12/2023,Picked this up for my mom in law. She has had another vizio tv for 9 years that works great still. she just wanted a bigger tv. This thing is terrible.  Developed lines all over the screens. The menu screens are messed up as well. Did a factory reset and nothing helped.,1
6/23/2023,"I've had this TV for 22 MONTHS and it's already history. It's had weird problems off and on but now is totally unusable.  It worked fine last night and this is what happened when I turned it on this morning. It actually got worse, but I've unplugged it and will be trashing it, as I did the other. I'm extremely disappointed.

This is the second Vizio I've owned and the first one did the same thing.",1
11/6/2022,the tv is great but the size is not accurate. I supposely bought a 50' . Once I got it my son installed it but when I saw it it lookt to small for me I used a measuring tape and is 44' not even the box it came in was 50' not cool. I did call customer service I dont have a Tv so I kept it they only gave $50 back for the incovineance.. smh,1

8/10/2021,This tv is the cheapest TV Ive ever seen. Is made in old school technology like the little legs that keeps it standing are sooo thin it barely holds the TV steady. Not only did the TV arrived cracked and broken into pieces when deliver which is a shame. I had a VIZIO for over 6 years was looking for an upgrade and is sad to see how low there standards have gone down.,1

You click the button on remote, the on light on the tv blinks a lot (haven't timed it) but the tv doesn't turn on. You wait and nothing. Then it stops blinking and then we click the on button again and then tv turns on. Weird. A tv should just turn on. Also, the button on the back of tv doesn't work to turn on tv either if tv has been off for a while.  Something seems wrong. This thing might be going back. Disappointed and frustrated Vizio!",1
12/26/2023,limited to what they want you to get. it has some cool features that would make it awesome if you didnt have to give up so many options to get those features . no internet browser options. have to use home app to cast to the tv which means if you want to let someone else cast to the tv then you have to add them to your google home account which basically will allow them access to all your media and files. if i wouldnt have gotten distracted by thier gimmicks of on demand tv built in then i could have had a Samsung and all you have to do with it is cast. simple . easy. google home is aweful and you are forced to use either google home or whatever the apple equivalent is. and i cant get my apps from my prime account even when logged into prim...,1

12/29/2023,The screen keeps changing colors from black white green blue red. I called Vizio they're supposed to bring me another TV out and install it. I've been waiting over three weeks now I'm at the point where I might just go back to Walmart and take it back there.,1
1/23/2024,"Ordered this for 65” tv for pickup. I was informed to watch the bottom as it was falling out. Once I got it home noticed it was strange no straps or tape holding the box together.. Slid the top portion of the box off, and was shocked at the amount of dust covering this “brand new” tv. Picked it up and noticed the power cable just balled up at the bottom. No neat folded wires and typical bread wrap like tie holding everything together. Then to top it off no remote or instructions. At this point I'm realizing this must've been a demo or returned TV.  Immediately I called my Walmart up and told them the situation. First thing told to me was if the serial numbers on the box and tv don't match the couldn't refund my purchase. I said well ok….I'm...",1
12/31/2023,2 things - first you can't add apps (they say every app is already on it but that's not true). second you can't mirror to it from an android device.

Same issue has persisted. I purchased the 5 year warranty but that doesn't kick in until the manufacturer warranty is over. I have another 6 months of this nonsense before I can hopefully get an entirely different brand. In the meantime I'll have to try %26 get something done through Vizio again. DO NIT PURCHASE THIS TV!

They lied to me. I would never buy from you guys.",1

Wal mart is insisting I need to return to a physical store which I cannot do as I do not drive, I am disabled and because we don't have a wal mart in my town. The whole reason I had it shipped. I am at a loss for words as this is the worst experience i've had from a multi billion dollar company who just robbed me. Incredible. Highly do not recommend buying a TV from here.",1

Vizio called me back today and it’s not covered under their limited warranty and we are 15 days out of the 90 warranty. There is no way around it. We have been a loyal VIZIO customer for 8/10 years.

I had a funeral to attend at 2:00pm  and was not sure what time it would arrive. It had been raining all morning and I did not want it to get rained on. Not only was the TV on my front pouch it was sticking out and anyone could have picked it up. It had started to rain by the time I returned home but luckily I was able to get it inside before it got wet.

I will never use this service again. Good job Walnart 👏",1
12/5/2023,"This tv arrived as a combo purchase to include a wall mount and sound bar. After installing the wall mount and installing the tv, when programmed the tv had 2 vertical lines from top to bottom on the left side of the screen. Started a return thinking I could get a replacement tv. I could only do a return assuming because it was part of a combo purchase. No explanation was actually given. Had to purchase the same replacement tv for four $70 more. What a ripoff and sad customer service. The inconvenience during this whole situation is unacceptable and nonsense.",1
11/26/2023,"The WORST picture I've ever seen on a television!! The picture was so bad, my husband and I immediately re-boxed for return. Upon thinking about how horrible the picture was, we unboxed the television again thinking there must have been a protective plastic shield over the screen because there was NO WAY this Vizio could have picture quality this bad! There was no protective cover over the screen.  And once again, we re-boxed for return.  I am so very disappointed.",1
12/8/2023,I brought a 65 in Vizio they said they delivered it got to the house it was not delivered Walmart should have a plan on the TV an I'm battling to get the TV or my money back it's said that the customer half to go through this type of sh%23%23 an it's sad an they don't even got Walmart delivery they go through door dash an try to have that company pay u back after u brought it though Walmart I'm so disappointed it makes no since,1
12/20/2023,This TV sucks. It loses connection all the time. You can fix it sure with a google search but then it happens again. Call Vizio support and they won't return it. They do the same thing you've been doing and tell you it's fixed when it will happen again. I will never buy another Vizio product or a TV from Walmart.,1
11/16/2023,"I purchased this tv  on 11/13/23 online for pick up at Walmart Portage WI..  I received an email at 4:09 P.M. the same day that it was ready for pick up and pick up hours were 7:00 A.M. to 10:00 P.M..  daily.  We went to pick it up mid morning the next day and were told we couldn't pick it up until after 5:00 P.M..  When we asked why we were told if we didn't like it we could cancel the order online.  We had driven over 50 miles round trip to get it.  When I got home I called and was again told I couldn't pick it up until after 5:00 P.M.. and if I didn't like it I could cancel the order online.

11/11/2023,This is a piece of junk. I received this piece of junk on Sept 30 and it stop working exactly 31 days later. There's nothing I can do about it and I think that's what Walmart was counting on someone elderly to buy this with no idea what they were getting. Thanks Walmart,1
12/13/2023,Never received item and Walmart is siding with Fedx because they took a picture supposedly in front of my door. The problem is I them to send it to one of there location order to pickup and got a text first thing in the morning saying it was being rerouted they will let me know when I can pickup instead the driver left it in the front door. Supposedly. Walmart doesn’t want to help me I have proof I asked to be sent to a pickup location yet they did what they wanted. Very unsatisfied customer,1
11/10/2023,"My TV was delivered with STICKERS on it saying ""deliver as is"". The side was crushed and there were water marks on all sides of the box. It wasn't raining here, I also got the TV as fed ex was leaving. It was a horrible experience. I returned it to the store with in an hour. I was very disappointed.",1
10/31/2023,The claim is that the item was delivered but I never got it. The delivery person allegedly left a brand new tv carelessly outside my door. Now it’s disappeared. Walmart have commenced investigations but I’m so traumatized by this experience. There’s a leasing office so why’d any right thinking person just claim to leave something so valuable and fragile so carelessly?,1
11/12/2023,"The TV was delivered LATE. There was no update with the tracking from 7AM until it was delivered late at nite around 9ish. So the TV had been on the truck that whooole time and was delivered BROKEN. It also was not in a concealed brown cardboard box it was just in the regular orange VIZIO box that you would see it in in the store. There should have been extra packaging.  It was left downstairs on the bottom floor and I am on the top floor, anyone cld have stolen the orange VIZIO 65 inch TV box that was left in plain site. Walmart is the worst.",1
11/9/2023,I can’t download many of the apps I use regularly so this really limits my use of this tv. The volume is horrible. There isn’t much difference between 48 and 88. When I do watch tv I have to keep the remote in my hand and I’m forever adjusting the volume.,1
11/21/2023,Item not received.  Item arrived at my local post office at 6:29 am on November 20th and the post office did not deliver.  Not surprised.  Had I known it was being shipped using the USPS I would never have ordered it.  I would have got it from AMAZON or BEST BUY.,1
12/4/2023,The television was broken when it arrived. I went to the local Wal-Mart store 0424 and was told that Wal-Mart couldn't give me another television because Wal-Mart do no longer do exchanges on anything but groceries without a receipt. After going online I discovered that Wal-Mart return policy had not changed.  Wal-Mart store 0424 need new front managers because they are rude and do not know what they are doing. I am very disappointed.,1
12/13/2023,"Totally unusable product, ready to throw in trash! I cannot access any of the premium channels that I'm already paying for through xfinity comcast, cannot link with my wi-fi connection to use the internet. Tomorrow I'll go back to my 10 year old t.v. at least I can watch the channels I'm already paying for.",1
11/26/2023,Had to wait in pick-up kiosk to get this TV.   The box was damaged and I was hoping that wouldn't be an issue but IT WAS.   After hauling it home and going thru all the trouble of unpacking it sooooo carefully I found it already had a crack in it!    Walmart corporate or an employee possibly was obviously not careful enough with it and didn't care and dumped it on an unsuspecting customer.  NOT COOL.,1
11/10/2023,"tv had defective tuner so I cannot utilize the functions. service worked extensively for about 2 hours and said they will replace the tuner immediately. 
Next day they are requesting that I send back the tuner with full explanation but I still can't use the TV. Very, very dissatisfied with with Visio service.",1
12/7/2023,I would write a nice review but I did not receive the TV would you please look into it it was $269. If it all possible I would like it credited back to my credit card because I did not receive the package. I’m sorry I can’t afford to buy another one. Thank you in advance.,1
12/13/2023,"Do not allow delivery by Fed Ex.  The driver that delivered our package ignored delivery instructions actually causing him more work (carrying extra large clumbsy package up a flight of stairs) forcing us to now get help putting the package at the correct door, so we can actually get the package INTO the house!  No clue what our product is like, as we don't yet have it at a door where we can get it checked out and fully functional, by actually bringing it into the house.  Sorry Fed Ex but today's driver is so pressed for time, he didn't even check his delivery instructions.  And that is not on your over worked delivery personnel that should be receiving extra support at this time of year.  It is on the company that is supposed to be a suppo...",1
12/4/2023,"I’ve had this tv for over a month, been having problems since. The tv will turn off by itself %26 in the middle of watching a movie it goes to home menu. Air play a movie, it kicks me out %26 constantly starts the movie over. Now me %26 my family can’t watch tv period. I’ve tried unplugging the tv %26 waiting a few minutes to restarting it, resetting the WiFi %26 etc. The tv completely stopped working.",1
11/10/2023,"This was a sham.  I paid for it but never got it. The shipper was addressed to another address with a weight listed of 2.65 pound's signed for by someone with a different name and Walmart admitted that their partner had done this to others, and they no longer deal with them.",1
11/29/2023,I specifically asked for this to be delivered but it wasn't . Instead I had to have it refund but what upsets me even more is that I have to wait 10 days to receive my money back but it didn't take 10 minutes to take my money from my account. I tried to purchase online an ONN tv on the 25th. An hour after submitting my order and payment I received notification that it was SOLD OUT… it's the 29th and I'm still waiting on my refund of that money as well . Walmart has almost $700 of my money and I have no TV yet I'm still waiting for my money that didn't take 5 minutes to remove from my account. It sucks,1
11/21/2023,"So I ordered this tv through the Walmart  app and they shipped it to the wrong address!! Even though my receipt clearly has the right address and the postal office didn’t mess up either. Postal office said the seller put the wrong address, not me not the postal office but Walmart or who ever they have contracts with. Besides the fact that they sent the tv somewhere else, I couldn’t get the same deal to by the tv again because Walmart said since it was a third party company they can’t do anything but refund me. Yet a week later that tv went up $100 so had to get it for a more expensive price because Walmart doesn’t know how to do business or fulfill orders. Be careful when ordering online, they have companies from other places selling on the...",1
11/29/2023,"According to the tracking it arrived at 2:47 pm.  Unfortunately they did not call, ring the doorbell or knock to let me know it was here.  I found it at 8:45 pm when I looked out the window wondering if they were coming.  It could have been out all night or worse, stolen.",1
12/20/2023,"Hello, I did reach out when my item was delivered as upon ordering I put instructions to have the TV delivered to a different address as it was ordered for a Christmas gift and I had nowhere to keep it out of view at my home. Well the TV was delivered to my home instead of the address I requested. Needless to say, it was seen so what was supposed to be a surprise, is not. I heard from nobody and am very disappointed in the customer service. I give one star not for the TV but for the lack of a response.",1
11/11/2023,We are so disappointed. We bought this tv in August 2023 and now in November 2023 it doesn't work. It freezes every single day. We have to unplug it and restart it multiple times a week. Of course there is only a 30 day return window so now we're stuck with a $500 tv that works when it wants to. We typically love our VIZIO tvs but this one is a lemon for sure.,1
11/27/2023,"first t.v. we had shipped,didnt come on ,so we had to send it back, no exchange was available. talked to walmart.com 3 times about pick up. finally had to call fedex myself. ordered new t.v. delivery was unavailable, so i sceduled curbside pick up. but when we got there they couldnt find my order.then said they had to cancel it because the t.v. was out of stock now. what a joke. our residnets at the nursing home have been waiting over 2 weeks now for a t.v.",1
11/27/2023,"I will never order another item from this walmart for pickup. I scheduled a pickup for 4-5pm because that worked with our schedules. I ordered the item and added my husband as an alternative pick up person and when he was there in a spot I checked him in. He waited in his car for a while before an employee came to his car and said he wasn't checked I and she said shechecked him in. He continued to wait for 2 hours for our single item. I tried to call the pickup phone multiple times and it rang and rang with no answer. He had our small daughter with him and we were eventually advised that we could leave and come back, but we are not able to do this the next few days due to our work schedules. It is completely unacceptable to make customers w...",1
12/24/2023,I ordered from here and said everything was available and I was charged my card. Come to find you it wasn’t available and I can’t even cancel my order to get my refund and I have to wait to get my money. I ordered and paid when it said the TV was available and an hour before I’m supposed to pick up I got a text saying my tv was no longer available but offered free shipping after Christmas. I tried to cancel my order asap and it won’t let me. I want my refund asap. I want confirmation that my order was cancelled and I can get my refund.,1
1/19/2024,I have purchased two tv and both of the tv screens have gone out! I've only owned the for a little over a year.,1
9/20/2023,Will last you less than a year. Constantly had issues with vertical lines on tv. They gave me a replacement but had the same issue come up months later. Never buying their products again.,1
8/23/2023,We just got it have to box it back up can't even get it to set up remote control won't let you do anything me and my won't be replacing it with this brand after reading these reviews we have only had it one day,1
10/3/2022,Bought Tv and my son (age 3.) threw a plastic egg at it and it shattered the screen.......  light small egg.... major damage.. really wonder if defective or not....,1
9/24/2022,The screen was cracked all the way up the front I went to Wal mart they said they couldn't do anything because it was over 30 days but the technician just came out today to hook it up and we pulled it out of the box together,1
8/20/2023,"Dont buy this tv,it dead after using it for a year,waste of money,the screen turned dark and red lines appears nothing else,broke than les than a year",1
7/1/2023,Just over 2 years old and the picture has lines everywhere; to the point that it’s aggravating to watch. I would recommend spending a little more money and getting a better quality and better warranty.,1
5/12/2023,"I never write reviews, this thing is a pile of junk! Less than a year and had green and yellow lines appearing through the middle of the screen. A few months later and now it flickers and flashes green, purple and yellow across the entire screen and is completely unwatchable! That's if you can even get the thing to even turn on from a completely blacked out screen! I wish I would have read all these 1 star reviews before purchase because it seems it's a common issue. What a waste of $300, hopefully this saves at least a few people from this garbage TV!",1
1/3/2024,"This tv turns it self off to much, but only on you tube and an antenna.     I will being returning it. I have had it 5 days.     Remote is hard to use.",1
1/6/2024,TV not 65” inch more like 57 “ (only box it came in is 65”.    Sound quality is poor and very cloudy picture.  Horrible smart tv had to return.  Buyer beware!,1
1/6/2024,"If you're watching a movie/TV show and there's a scene with no dialogue or background music, the sound will just cut out completely. It really takes you out of the movie and makes it hard to enjoy watching it. Apparently there's no way to fix it",1
1/1/2024,The TV malfunctions after ever show blinking in and out. It also mutes itself. Plus this TV is difficult to tune in. You have to make a lot of choices just to view regular channels. We are very dissatisfied with this brand .,1
1/20/2024,tv screen had a damage spot in corner of television screen. Didn't see it until everything was programed and connected.  It's a inconvenient to repackage and start over. So I paid full price for a damaged tv. I will not order electronic again.,1
1/20/2024,"way to mention this TV cannot be mounted. get it home, out of the box, only to see theres nothing on the back to use. at all. freaking stupid. returning and never buying Vizio again.",1
1/12/2024,"1st i ask them not to leave a 50"" tv on porch, i live in a apt. bldg. they left it on porch. 2nd i lose my netflix because Vizio wants to hijack my apps! i barely even use it...not happy.",1
7/5/2023,"much too complicated for us old people. there is no menu button on the (clicker). i probably send it back. i also did not get an instruction guide with it.sad, situation .",1
12/25/2023,Horrible shipping was supposed to be here next day then they changed to day after then they changed to a week later very very unhappy cannot change shipping date every day,1
6/29/2023,Smart cast sucks. The TV is super slow I don't recommend at all. Just get a Roku or Samsung. I don't see how it has so many good reviews. Can hardly watch tv without it going out and smart ast not working.. literally every time.,1
7/17/2023,I returned this television the next day after receiving it because it was the wrong model and I am having a terrible time getting my refund. Dealing with FedEx was a very unpleasant experience and now I’m having the runaround about the pending refund. I doubt very much if I will ever use walmart.com again and I certainly won’t use FedEx.,1
7/22/2023,"Doesn't detect Wi-Fi networks. Will manually connect, but when you turn the TV off and back on, it won't re-connect.

Doesn't support 4K UHD Xbox despite using a known good HDMI cable, trying multiple HDMI ports, updating firmware, restarting all devices, etc.",1
7/29/2022,To had this tv for only 31 days and I turned it on and there are all vertical lines on50 % of the screen!  DO NOT BUY a Vizio!  It happened to my son as well!  I had Vizio for years and loved the brand but now 300 in the waste basket!  So truly disappointed!,1
7/27/2023,"First, the TV took two hours to set up.  It downloaded software or firmware five times.  Thence message appeared that the SmartCast was unavailable.  There is no home screen showing available apps.  The color was washed out, and none of the available settings would correct the issue.  The time was wrong, and there was no way to correct it.  Overall, this Vizio TV was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.  I have two older models that have much better pictures and features than this one.  I guess you really do get what you pay for.  I didn't pay very much, and I certainly didn't get very much.",1
8/5/2023,The tv didnt load any apps since I opened it up. spent 3 hours on the phone with hulu alone only to find out it was the tv. I always swore by the Vizio brand by not anymore. Went with a Tcl Roku 55 inch and I love it the color is better the ease of use is better and it was even cheaper.,1
6/7/2021,"We were very optimistic about our purchase given the quality of all of our other VIZIO TVs we own.  Boy were we wrong.  As soon as we plugged in the tv and turned it on, we were going through the initial setup and it would not connect to our wifi.  We did all of the trouble shooting, as the tv showed it was connected to our wifi with strong signal strength but it showed a failure message.  After rebooting our router a few times, trying to start over with the set up, we were able to somehow get it to connect.  The tv then searched for updates, tv shut off, when it rebooted it gave us an error message it was not able to complete update.  If we then hit cancel, we could bypass and actually start to watch tv.  Once you turned it off and back on...",1
10/23/2023,"Had to get another tv due to my 1st HD Tv pic going out, and had the BEST picture quality (for a older tv-720p). This 4k is the worst out of the 5 tvs I have. I have to constantly change the picture setting day/ night-time. No need for backlight. Too much of a glare, no matter the settings!",1
9/10/2023,"Woke up this morning to a dead tv in my living room so I thought this would fit the bill… nope. Everything was fine… picture quality, fine. Audio quality, fine. The inability to delete the pre installed  apps or organize your Home Screen… nope. I’m returning this for a monitor, I don’t need to pay a company to try and feed me ads let alone give them space in my living room. We set the tv up and spent 1hr with it and we’re packing it back up and returning it, worst purchase this year.",1
7/7/2023,"My tv did not come with the power cord, legs or remote. I'm being told 5-7 business days before I will receive the items that should have been in the box. The manufacturer is putting it on Walmart and Walmart is putting it on the manufacturer. They are shifting the blame and will not expedite items within 24 hours. When I called Walmart's customer service I was told that I had to buy the missing items!!! Totally unacceptable and as a long time customer with  Walmart I'm very disappointed and will not be shopping at Walmart ever again!!!!",1
12/10/2022,TV arrived damaged.,1
9/16/2023,Dave is no longer here he passed away a few days ago I was promised this delivery would be made tomorrow now this has been changed this is not acceptable to be put off three more days someone needs to contact me and I need to change something because this is no longer acceptable,1
8/11/2023,"I ordered online and paid for delivery - went to install and found that we received a 43"" rather than the 55"" ordered and paid for:(  Refund was fine, however, I have to return it to the store even though it is the stores mistake and I paid for delivery.  Not very happy.",1
3/17/2023,"Got this installed and from day one I've had nothing but trouble with it, constantly having to factory reset as well as unplugging it. finally had to get factory technician in here and I replaced the main board, and it's been working okay since then. but now it's got lines in the picture, and getting hold of support is almost impossible. I will never buy another Vizio again after this experience.",1
6/28/2023,even when plugged directly into a router with consistent 300mbps this tv only gets 8mbps. content either constantly buffers or has severe quality drops. this is with it plugged directly into the ethernet port. the tv does not give you control over any of the options or anything standard in a 4k tv.,1
8/23/2023,I ordered online and picked up at the store. I set everything and as soon as I turned it on. It was cracked from one end to the middle of the screen. I returned back to the store within 30 minutes. I was told since I bought it online that I couldn't do an exchange. The TV had to be refunded. This was a big inconvenience!!,1
8/2/2021,"None of the apps work! Please see picture. Okay picture quality, but horrible tv. I usually buy Samsung, but decided to give this one a try. Big mistake! This tv was functional for 2 days at best and then all the apps crashed. We tried everything to get it to work and nothing. So disappointing! I'm returning this.",1
8/3/2023,I don't like to fact that your can't download certain apps. You can only have the apps that's installed on the tv or use your phone to connect. Readjusting the volume and setting the tv colors shows okay but the volume is horrible. I have to turn my television up to at least 50/60 to hear in the area.,1
9/7/2023,"I specifically bought this tv for the HDMI 2.1 ability to replace my previous 55"" tv that did not. Which in the description %26 specs on this page it states numerous times that this tv has a HDMI 2.1 input. Well, that is false. There is no HDMI 2.1 port on the tv. So, essentially I bought this tv for no reason. Waste of money and false advertising.",1
10/5/2023,"Right out of the box, the tv did not work. I called tech support and after an hour of trying all different things. Plug it in and ply it out. Restart. Reboot. Unplug the internet and plug it back in. Move the router. Finally they tech said that I needed a repair person to come out and fix the brand new tv. So, I'm waiting for a call. 
Not off to a great start. 
Tech was very good though and so was the young man who helped me to maneuver the tv into my car. Great service from both.",1
10/17/2023,Absolutely horrendous! Item arrived with a shattered screen. Made contact with someone who was completely unable to figure out how to offer me an exchange. The label that was apparently created for me to ship item back is not available on the like. Simply states “sorry”. I merely want to exchange my damaged product for one that isn't. How can this be such an issue?,1
9/10/2023,this is the bigest pice of crap you turn it on and you have to go to antena and wate for it to finaly find a chanel and it takes forever to work i put this junk in the garage where it might get used once a year maby this will be the last vizio ill ever but what a disapointment,1
5/21/2021,So I bought this TV Monday night 5-17-21 I started to use it the next day and it froze on me 4 times on the first day of use the only way to get it to work was to unplug it has done the same thing every day with a blank screen then it started going to a fuzzy screen on 2 day so I'm taking it back and getting my money back crazy cause I have another vizio tv that I've had since 2013 never had not 1 issue with it but this thing is garbage.,1
9/4/2023,"Did not work.  I suspect it was a store demo, and they were passing it off as new because it was beautifully repackaged and looked totally unopened—except there was no protective film over the screen. When they repackaged it after the demo, they put it back into the WRONG carton—so the serial numbers didn’t match and they didn’t want to give me my refund.  Caveat emptor:  MAKE THEM OPEN THE BOX there before you leave the store and compare serial numbers or you may have wasted hundreds of dollars because wal mart won’t properly train their people!!   The store manager was instructing everyone as I got my refund that if the numbers don’t match going forward THERE WILL BE NO REFUNDS ISSUED.  Well,  too bad for us honest citizens—we get done ov...",1
8/24/2023,Do not buy.  Had for less than 3 months it's been a problem from the start.  Tv does not connect to Wi-Fi.   I'm continuously having to restart the tv 3-4 times to finally get it connected sometimes it doesn't connect.  I have even factory reset the tv.  At first I though it was a issue with my homes wifi but all other devices work.,1
9/12/2023,I ordered a tv to be delivered to my home. Delivery stated that it was delivered. We didn't get the tv. This was on the 09-05-2023. I have been contacting Walmart everyday since and have only been put to another person and repeatedly been put on hold for over 90 minutes each time. No answer from them yet. So beware if you order doesn't come. Try to get a refund. ☹️,1
10/15/2023,Its been leas than 4 months that i made this purchase and now Tv screen freezes. I called customer service and they said i only had 30 dys for warranty. I spend a large amount of money only  to not be able to use my TV. Customer service was of no help to assist in this issue. I am dissatisfied and disappointed in the lack of assistance to help in my matter.,1
8/17/2023,I know it's probably not your fault but I just ordered this and Ned today it comes broken I was so mad I immediately boxed it up quicker than I could even think of taking a picture to show you guys. I would say if your going to have this delivered don't because they use FedEx and from experience and working there it's not a safe bet to have it delivered.,1
9/6/2023,arrived with bottom of box missing. If i hadnt been outside with delivery driver the TV would have fell out of box. no straping either. it was saved but question if it was a floor model or returned at some point. will update once tv is installed to check it out,1
8/12/2021,"Don't buy it!!! Purchased on 8-8-21, TV freezes up, sound stops working, everything on remote stops working, you have to unplug TV to get it reset.

I called Vizio to try and troubleshoot, but no solutions were possible, and a new TV was recommended. This was my second Vizio TV, which the first one, part of the screen burned out. Therefore, because of the constant issues I'm no longer buying Vizio TVs. They only last a few years and then the screen goes. I would recommend a different brand.",1

We contacted Vizio for warranty information 3 weeks ago and they promised to send us a replacement tv in 7-10 days.  Three weeks later we have bought a new, bigger TV at half the price with a different brand name.  We still have not received the replacement and they have thus far refused to refund our purchase price instead of the replacement.  We will never buy another Vizio anything!!!",1

6/10/2023,"I would give this minus 10 stars if i could. I ordered 2 of these 55"" tvs and opened one up and set it up. Had a terrible time trying to get it configured. After spending nearly a whole day troubleshooting it as well as talking with Vizio customer support we agreed the tv couldnt be fixed. According to the Vizio CSR the firmware was outdated and the tv was not connecting to the Vizio servers to update the tv and all the apps. The WatchFree LIVE tv was 3hrs behind the real time on the tv and could NOT be fixed. Also, when i tried to watch anything on Amazon, Hulu, Pluto tv or any other similar app the tv showed error messages that it couldn't be played. Its very disappointing and i was initially very excited to get more Vizio TV's since the ...",1
7/21/2021,"We chose Visio because our old one was so good. But this one had too many flaws. Background screen was gray, not black. Off TV reflected lights in the room. Contrast not crisp. Picture was good when viewed from the right side but was washed out if you viewed from the left side. At best the return of this item to Walmart was professionally handled without a hassle.",1
6/19/2021,"I had this tv for less than 1 week and the input channels were constantly running across the screen, the volume was turning up and down on it's own and the tv would randomly turn on by itself.

11/24/2023,Dislike the fact you take money for something that is out of stock. Followed by the fact it could take up to ten days to be credited back. You need a system that will not charge for items you don't have in stock.,1

12/12/2023,This TV has a very blurry picture. I've played around with the settings and it hasn't gotten much better. Making a more expensive purchase is 100% worth it.,1

Around  April 20, 2023 Vizio did a software update that made it almost impossible to watch my over-the-air channels with my slow and unreliable internet connection. I had to turn the wi-fi off to get them back. Even so, it's very slow to get a picture when I turn on the TV, and there's an annoying menu now too.

After hours and multiple calls to troubleshoot the TV, router, and ISP, the TV was replaced via the warranty process.  The new TV that was delivered had the exact same problem. Clearly, this is a manufacturer's issue.",1
5/21/2023,"TV refused to connect to the app, didn't log into streaming services, was a nightmare - Spent 2 hours with Vizio customer service and then they disconnected me and sent me to a new rep. That was after telling my me to change settings on my phone and download other apps. ridiculous. Not very smart, imo. I'd rather have a tube tv in black %26 white. Exchanged it for a hisense Roku tv and set up took maybe 2 minutes, everything logged in immediately, app works, and I can stream from phone and other devices.

I have taken it back to factory settings several times but it doesn’t help, I believe this TV is a lemon.

We searched/tried both VIZIO's site and the internet for instructions on how to make this TV work. We couldn't get any content to play from normal apps like Prime, Hulu or Apple after we signed in to those accounts on the TV.  We couldn't even get past the Netflix screen to sign in to it. We also could not get the chromecast that is supposedly already on the TV to work.

I have spent over 5 hours trying to return and receive what I purchased.  Beware when you purchase something on line.  Walmart confirmed it is mismarked but nothing they can do about it, just have to wait for a return label from the person that sent it",1
5/5/2023,"This is not a technical review of this television, more of a complaint. I'm hoping it will eventually turn out to be a good TV. But there is a major caveat that any potential buyer should be aware of.

The VOC odor of this TV is the strongest of any piece of electronics I've even encountered. As soon as I unpacked it, every one of my family members commented on the awful smell. Within a few minutes, two family members complained of headaches.

I moved it out to my garage. I kept the garage door open during the day to help with the ventilation. The last two days, I've brought it out to my patio in hopes that the sun plus the outdoor breeze would help accelerate the off-gassing. It has not helped. The several times I brought it back in to see...",1
3/26/2023,"This is a great value and has wonderful picture, but do not purchase this TV if you want to use any features such as screen mirroring, built in Apple Airplay or in general want a TV with updated firmware.  Purchased and right out of the box the Apple Airplay %26 screen mirror wouldn't work.  Spent about an hour trouble shooting on our own and over 1 1/2 hours on phone with Vizio support.  The firmware was not updated, so all the features do not work, and the TV would not manually update the firmware by factory reset, manual update or via a process that was a pain using a thumb drive.  Essentially this meant these features are not available and TV would always be out of date.  Vizio advised me that they would not send a replacement since som...",1
6/21/2023,"Not the happiest with this purchase. The feet were incredibly difficult to install due to the holes being misaligned. Sound just SUCKS!! Had to purchase a sound bar for added volume.

Picked this one out because vizio had better reviews along with it was more expensive so gave it a try. Regret my decision and wish i stuck with the other cheaper TCL roku models or something else. Its missing crunchy roll as well which is weird it has funimation that was bought out by crunchy roll. Also doesnt have forward rewind button on remote and back button doesnt work on Netflix had this tv two days and is 10x worse than its cheaper competitors. Save your money look for a roku alot mor...",1
5/11/2023,Going to see how good or poor the Vizio customer service is.  The return window is 30 days.  I have had the TV 34 days.  All of a sudden I now have a vertical and horizontal line running across the screen.  No storms.  No power surges.  And even if that was the case I have it on a very good surge protector.  I'm so disappointed.  But we shall see what the process is with service or replacement.,1

Had a technician from VIZIO to come to look at it because it was straight out of the box and they are unable to replace due to warranty.

12/16/2023,Sound is terrible. literally have it on 100 and still not the best.,1
11/22/2023,Dislike I never received my order I was scammed out of my money,1
11/24/2023,Like to get up date on when it's being delivered,1
11/18/2023,Tv doesn’t connect to WiFi well and constantly gets stuck on channels,1
11/24/2023,Lines through tv right out of the box.  Returned,1
10/24/2021,"sound never worked tried everything, then after turning off to restart grey screen, it never paired with phone, smartcast never worked, a disaster!  returned 16 hours later, its a beautiful tv and pity it never worked",1
7/8/2021,"Plugged it in and watched for about 30 minutes and boom, I get this huge nasty line on the right-center on the screen.. I suggest buying a better tv..",1
10/6/2021,"Sorry but on this occasion I can’t give any stars. After my TV arrived great care was taken to make sure it remained safe. Once my TV mount installer that I also ordered from Walmart set it up and left I plugged it up and noticed the screen was shattered. I was very disappointed. Now I have to send this one back before I receive the new one putting me a  week or maybe more behind to enjoy great TV in my living room area. When the new one arrives I don’t expect to have to pay another set up fee for installation. I only gave a star because the link prompted me to, otherwise no star.",1
11/16/2021,The tv randomly cuts off . Audio will stop working or the picture cuts out also. You have to unplug it and then reconnect to get it to get back working  or just change hdmi ports every week. If you remember. Terrible tv. Hesitant to buy another or recommend. I hate it so much I came here just to hate on it,1
4/8/2022,"If you really want to waist your hard earned money then this is the TV for you. You'll be very pleased to know that in just two short years the LEDs burn out. If you're dumb like me You'll try to fix it yourself.  You'll purchase an led kit ""not cheap"" by the way,  only to find that they've sealed the screen so that it cracks before you can remove it.
I will never purchase another Visio product. Not even accidentally. 
I'm telling you that I never complain about anything but after paying the better part of a thousand dollars for this thing I expected it to last longer than two years.
Thanks for nothing Visio.
May the boogers of a thousand noses land on your foreheads.",1
12/8/2021,"I generally do not submit reviews but I felt compelled to do so now.  I have come to realize that I should have read all of the negative reviews.  Although I understand that some comments you have to take some with a grain of salt.  The TV looked amazing at the time of set up with vibrant colors.  Once it was set up the colors no so! The TV is dark, no matter how I changed the settings with and without Vizio's assistance. Some colors are fine but all faces have a tint of orange or looks like a really bad self tanning lotion mishap. Another big issue is IT STINKS! It smells like burning plastic. I thought it was the packaging/plastic it was sent in but it is in fact the TV. You can smell it (TV on or off) as soon as you walk into my house.  ...",1
4/9/2022,"I read the reviews and had high expectations with this TV but the picture is not like you're in a movie theater and definitely not the sound. The sound is awful, you have to turn it up so high just to hear it. You'll definitely need a sound bar. I bought this TV to replace my 50” Emerson that I've had for years but the Emerson is better than the Vizio. To top it off just 2 days after I began using the Vizio , it has lines coming down from the top of the screen! What is this!! I definitely want my money back!",1
6/2/2022,"We did all the research, and finally decided on this tv. It was fabulous for 2 months when suddenly the middle went dark. It turns out there is a strip of LEDs that's out, and to fix it requires a lot of work and a hefty fee. We are kind of heartbroken at paying this much money for just 2 months of satisfaction.",1
8/25/2022,Screen died just minutes ago after less than a hundred hours of use. Purchased it just 6 months ago. I have lots of very expensive VIZIO TVs. This was a cheap $300.00 version. Get what you pay for. We have a second one still in unopened box. Guess that one will die as well within a 100 hours of use?,1
11/24/2021,"I was very excited for this TV to arrive Nov. 19th as it originally stated, but instead I got it Nov. 24 because the shipping company doesn't work weekends. It arrived with a big dent in the middle. It's completely unusable and Walmart won't start sending me a new one until this one gets picked up in possibly 3-5 days. My new TV arrival date is Dec. 24th. I wanted to love this TV but I'm very displeased with this outcome and will just get a refund instead of waiting another month or two",1
5/5/2022,"I hate this tv! I was hacked by this tv … when I was signing up for Amazon prime. It had a box …to call or scan the box with the code thing .. so I called and they had me on the phone for 3 hours. Fraud from bank .. western union, money gram, Walmart, and credit cards. Now This tv will not even turn on!!! I need a number to contact to resolve this television problem … the manual to this tv is on the tv .. no hard copy .. horrible!!!",1
6/21/2023,I don’t recommend this brand. Tv screens was defective within 9 months,1

5/27/2023,"I've always been a avid fan of the Vizio TV's and my wife tried convincing me to go another route with our new television purchase. I of course went against her thoughts and thanks to Vizio have gotten plenty of ""Told ya So” or 
""Wife's know Best"". Got the tv home and on the stand for my wife to do the initial start up (not my thing) for her to tell me it wasn't allowing any of the apps like Netflix, Amazon and all the others to watch any programs. I called the tech support and the gent walked me through the reset process which entailed going to YouTube and watching a clip which I did successfully. So therefore I figured tv was good to go and thanked him. Feeling back on top again I handed the remote and said your all set my dear. It wasn't...",1
12/29/2022,"we recieved a defective tv , called in asked for replacement , took all info, a replacement was to be replaced , with in  week at least , as you see our order was placed and tv bought and paid for with a 4 year protection plan, and  the $99 install.. besides our tech (JOSH) who was the worst installer, Ive ever done business with, the tv was defective , would go black for 2 days or more, freeze up , no change channels, would not shut off ,or come on,  some days, so I was told replacement would be within a week , never heard anything, tried to be patient,, this is awful, no word from walmart, no word from anyone, NO TV REPLACEMENT!! this is 12/29

11/15/2022,"Save your money, this 65” “smart” TV worked less than 2 months. The sound doesn't work half the time.  The smart TV feature just stopped working, won't connect to our network, Wi-Fi or any other device. Turns off by itself randomly. Can't use our Roku, Netflix, or HDMI hookup's. Complete garbage! Worked just long enough that you can't return to Walmart… so frustrating!",1
9/4/2022,Have had this television for about 5 months.  In that time I have come to despise vizio products.  The on screen menu system is slow to react - yes I've done the 'factory reset' and it doesn't fix anything.  The worst part is the television is now essentially bricked after a firmware update.  The bitterness of low quality remains long after the sweetness of low price has faded.,1
8/30/2021,"This is my first Vizio and went with it because it was a great price. Purchase this tv on 8/4/21 and straight out of the box after setup it was trouble. The biggest issue I had was the horrible lag with this tv at first I wasn't sure why and maybe thought it was my internet but I quickly realized that it wasn't. I have super fast high speed internet and several smart TVs along with other devices that are connected to it and none of my other devices were lagging. Next the tv would freeze and we had to complete reset it to get it to start backing working but not without the lag of course. I was so disappointed and dissatisfied because I thought I found a great tv for a great price, but you get what you pay for. I have since returned this Tv a...",1
6/15/2022,"The TV is a piece of garbage.  The sound is poor quality, so I figured I'd shop around and buy the accessories and equipment to play the audio through a sound bar.  Only to find out the audio output doesn't work, so I'm stuck with a TV not fit for purpose.  There was only a 30 Day return window so I'm stuck with a hunk of junk that I can't return. Visio used to be good stuff, but not any longer.  I bought a replacement that was bad for other reasons... $600 and two pieces of garbage.  Fortunately I was able to return the second TV but I'm still stuck with one $298 anchor.  Walmart return policy used to be good and Visio products used to be good, but not any longer.",1

5/30/2023,Worst TV ever. This TV is totally messed up and Vizio cannot fix it. They keep giving me the runaround. I'll never buy a Vizio again,1

5/28/2022,TV freezing up and the controller want work anymore. I had to unplug the TV and replugg TV back to get it to work again before it would respond. It happened several times. I returned it for a refund.,1
11/30/2022,I bought this TV August 2021 and today Nov 2022 the screen went black and white with no reason at all. Yesterday it was working good and today the screen stopped working just few months after 1 year warranty.,1
6/15/2022,It was ok.. just past a year we turned it on to have a jumping screen and it looked like a purple bar code. Customer service said it's cheaper to just buy a new one versus repairs. Won't purchase this brand again,1
8/10/2022,horrible havent had this tv 30 mins and glare on the bottom middle screen if i could give no stars i would. my eye keep catching it so i have to return it,1
2/6/2022,Was purchased in October 2020 one year and 3 months ago. Use for entertainment room. No video game playing. Warranty is necessary for this garbage TV.,1
1/21/2023,I had my old tv for the last 7 years until it started going out and decided get a new Vizio tv and after 6months the tv remote stop working  and I even got the warranty on the new Vizio tv and it a nightmare to get a tech out to fix the problem,1
2/23/2023,"Not even 2 years old and the screen has color lines in it. Freezes at least 3 times a month. Completely unsatisfied.
Had my previous Vizio for 12 years. This one is junk.",1
10/29/2022,Great TV for about 1year with minimal use   Started with 1 white spot on bottom left and now lines running up 1/2 the screen.  Definitely buy the warranty worth the $60 for 3 years.  Waiting on reimbursement now,1
2/20/2023,Bought this less than two months ago and it already starting having issues. The screen goes out and comes back. Of course outside of the return window. Would not recommend.,1
8/13/2021,I bought this for my parents who insisted on a Vizio! I had zero expectations but was absolutely embarrassed by the quality. The volume is incredibly quiet even at the highest level.,1
11/28/2023,When Vizio first came out they were just an awesome TV and now they're junk I have to unplug mine at least two three times a day to get it to work if I would have known this cuz my daughter's had a Vizio and they had that Vizio for years and years if I would have known how crappy they're making them now I would have never bought it,1
7/7/2022,"This TV is junk.  The picture is good and the sound is ok, but even when directly connected to the internet via ethernet cable, it buffers and lags. There is a lag with the remote also. You press a button,  then wait for a redponse, over and over.  There is no way to remove unwanted apps. Their support site says the V series does not come with that option. 
The only way to fix the issues with slow response of the remote, and the freezing, skipping, and buffering while streaming is to reboot, or unplug the power, then press the power button on the back of the tv and hold it for 30 seconds,  then plug the tv back in and hope for the best.  I have to reboot the tv at least 3 times every day. 
The ONN Roku tv's we have are WAY better.  I'll nev...",1
11/16/2022,"The screen was cracked, missmatched feet were in the package, and no bands were on the package.  Look at the photo that the Walmart delivery associate took and notice that my hand is on the bottom of the package.  The package is upside down because it started to slide out of the package.  I believe that this TV had already been returned.   I would like to have a TV that isn't broken.",1
9/2/2021,"I wish I had known before I purchased this that there would be no way to use my favorite apps, like Kanopy, without casting from a device, which creates horrible lag and power drain.

10/26/2022,I will never buy Vizio brand TV again due to the video part of the TV failing after 7mo. A lot of people out there work hard for their money as I do and saving to buy a nice tv to have it crap out is absolutely ridiculous stay away from this brand unless you just want to throw your hard-working money away.,1

Previous Vizio 50-incher: good wuality aluminum.] The ""voice control"" remote is a pain in the, urm, patootie, and the INSISTENCE that the TV MUST be networked ('s'all right. I can cut it off at the knees at the router) was also irritating, as was the fact that there was NO PRINTED MANUAL (which turned out to be all right, since the manual available online was very nearly useless).

No matter how much I tried to get itvto connect thru my cell with Comcast nothing was working eventhough itvwent thru on my phone. When I called Walmart and they looked into it, they told me it was an issue with the program download with the TV. It seems that the Apps were on the Tav but it was malfunctioning  when it came time to connect as the program itself wasnt installed on the TV. They offered to set-up a pickup date to send it to the manufacturer  but I just returned it and got a different  brand.",1
11/22/2022,"I purchased this TV on 11/29/2021 and the TV will not stay connected to the internet. I contacted VIZIO for a replacement because I had this issue before and was told they only will send a technician to try and fix the problem. The problem was never fixed and told the agent with this TV when there is an issue with the internet connection that it will work for a short time and then stop working again. I was told that was all they could do to try and repair the TV.
 I had to purchase a new TV and would never purchase a VIZIO TV again.",1

11/30/2022,"Not all affordable TVs are built the same. I've had this TV for eight months and I regret my purchase every day. Apps frequently do not work, buttons on the remote stick, and audio cuts out intermittently for no discernable reason, both on the device speakers and my external speakers through a receiver. 

No, unplugging the TV from the outlet once a day is not a viable workaround, Vizio.

Buy something else, this TV is not worth your trouble.",1
2/25/2023,The tv was fine up until about 4 months after i purchased it. Never wants to connect to any input without resetting the tv. I looked online and it is a common issue with no fix other than having someone come out to “repair” the tv. I really didnt like Vizio to begin with and this purchase just soldified me never wanting to purchase another one of their products again.,1

It didn't arrive until Saturday which was too late for their help. Also Walmart advertised $79 for their installation. When I then went to arrange for that I was told they didn't have anyone available ""at this time"" to do that in fact they could not tell me when they would have someone available and if that was a national problem or specific to my area.  Very bummed. The company did give me a discount so I could hire someone else but it did not cover the cost I had to pay for installation.",1
9/15/2021,The TV is defective. The first day the TV was difficult to turn on. After hitting the power button on both the remote and the tv it still wouldn't come on. I have to unplug the tv first then the power button will work. The screen go black but the audio is still working. Not worth the $700.,1
10/11/2021,"The sound system is horrible.  Even tried connecting sound bar but the TV is defective.  Background sound and commercials are loud and clear, but dialogue is silent.  Happens on all stations.  TV must be unplugged to reboot before sound goes back to normal.",1
2/9/2023,"Should have read the reviews! I wanted to replace another Vizio from 6 years ago because this one has all the apps. I haven't seen anyone comment on how difficult the legs are to out on, so I almost wonder if I was given the wrong ones! It's going back simply because of this. The tv tilts because the legs arent right. Once plugged in, the picture isn't that great. You get what you pay for. Save your money and pass on this one.",1
12/31/2021,"I’m a pretty big Vizio fan and unfortunately Vizio has lowered their quality since my last tv a few years ago. We got this tv for a Christmas gift and it kept shutting off every 5-10 minutes. Vizio said they need an update for Vizio tvs to handle a ps5. 
There should have been a warning about Vizio not being able to handle a ps5. I’ve tried all the troubleshooting techniques and then contacted Vizio. It came from their mouth that MOST Vizio tvs need an update to handle a ps5. Fix your quality control Vizio. You used to be better than this.",1
2/17/2024,"I am not happy with this television at all. Since we purchased it it shuts off on us in the middle of a show. We cannot get channels that we used to watch. It is more of a movie theatre than a television show tv. And right now it won't even turn on. I have had other Vizio televisions and was pleased with them. That is why I purchased this one, but it looks as though I will have to purchase another tv and it won't be a Vizio.",1
5/22/2022,"constantly buffers during the times i watch apps like netflix, etc.... i have to turn tv off and let it sit and turn back on. sometimes i have done this up to 6 times during a movie. it is not my connection...the other smart tvs in the home work fine",1
5/29/2022,"Returning it ASAP after 4 days.   The TV keeps going off by itself and I have to wait to restart it.    Watching a 1 hour show, it turns off appx 12 times.   I was on the phone with my cable company and they did all the resets and tech work and it is NOT the cable.  Do yourself a favor and find another TV to buy.",1
9/6/2021,I usually don’t leave reviews but it’s called for here. The tv has a lag between the audio and the video so I have to switch on and off once or twice almost every time to get it to be in sync. The LED remote also stopped working in three days. So definitely returning it.,1
2/17/2024,"i literally had the tv for 5 months and the led tube went out. to order a new 1 and have the hassle of putting it myself i could have just bought a new one.  the led tube should have lasted longer then 5 months. 

even told walmart and they said i should have gotten the warranty.. 

no what yall should have done was give me same tv at hlf price.",1
2/13/2024,This TV was obsolete right out of the box. The smart cast did not work. Every app we opened was unable to play content including Vizios own app. You have to get a fire stick or Apple TV or Roku to use this TV. Returned it and got an LG smart TV that actually  works the way it is intended without additional streaming devices.,1
2/13/2024,Not the tv. The rating is for Walmart.com . Refused to give price reduction when tv price dropped $50 from Saturday to Monday which was the day it arrived . Done with Walmart forever .  Bestbuy would never treat customers this way . Sorry I bought from Walmart. Won't happen again.Don't buy at Walmart . And Service online and phone is a joke,1
8/24/2022,"TV did not come with screws. We looked in every inch of the packaging. They weren’t there. Has to buy some. Was inconvenient. 
Also, the TV doesn’t have a great color picture. After messing with settings and recommended settings, it’s no better. I’d like to return but too much of a hassle.",1
11/3/2022,"I disliked the fact that we sat home all day waiting for our deliver because Walmart didn't give us a time window. I tried calling the Toms River Route 37 store at least three times during the delivery day and no one answered the phone any of those times. I finally got through to the Walmart customer service and when they called the TR store the results were the same. NO ANSWER!! I received an email around 7 pm telling me the delivery would be the next day and then another one about 8:45 pm telling me the order would arrive in ten minutes. It did arrive at 9 pm, not in a delivery truck, but in the back of an Uber car. I have never had an experience like this before and hope to never have another one again. I don't shop at Walmart stores and...",1
1/9/2022,"I have owned a Vizio 60"" tv in the past and it was an excellent tv.  That being said, this model has got to be the worst tv I have ever bought.  I bought two of these 70""tv's.  Bought one, and then another to replace the first.  Second one was no better than the first.  Switching inputs just shows a black screen, even though the device is on, Smartcast not available, won't respond to commands and the software is slower than trying to access AOL through dial-up.  Taking both back and buying a Samsung!!",1
2/14/2022,This is an absolute piece of junk. Every single day I have to give this tv a reboot. At least 3 times a day. And don't get me started with the smartcast that just freezes the system and never works. I own 5 tv's in my house. This is the only Vizio one and is the only one that gives me issues. Another thing is that for some reason the internet drops on the tv but my other 4 work perfect as a matter of fact everything that needs wifi works besides this tv. So that's another reboot. My advice is try to avoid this junk. Never ever again I am buying a Vizio product.,1
12/24/2022,"This is junk, don’t waste your money.  Vizio used to be good until they started this smartcast crap!  It’s always hanging up and buffering.  Plug in a different tv and no problem.  Keep getting “smartcast is searching”.  Must unplug the tv for minutes.  All other internet devices working.  I’ll never buy another vizio!",1
11/14/2021,"Do not buy this TV. The sound isn’t linked up right with the display, it’s delayed and looks like whatever show you’re watching is being dubbed! There’s no Spotify or Apple Music app, your only option is Tidal, vevo, or pandora and who tf uses those? And now, just a month after I bought this tv, so I can no longer return it, all streaming services stopped working!! I know it’s not my connection because for some reason YouTube still works, but Hulu, Netflix, Amazon prime, and HBO Max will not work!!! So now I have to buy a whole new TV. I had a TCL before this for about a year and it was great but I moved states and couldn’t bring it, so I might go back to that, or just splurge on a Samsung OLED and call it a day. Anyways, DO NOT BUY THIS!! ...",1
11/21/2022,The remote does not work after a few weeks. I’ve tried to get in touch with customer service to no avail which is extremely frustrating. I noticed problems with the remote when I bought the tv but didn’t pay much attention because I thought it was bad batteries. I heard Vizio was a good brand but I’m not so sure. Overall the remote is one of the most important parts of the tv and it’s not working!,1
2/1/2024,"Honestly, I wish I can give this zero stars because this is the worst experience I ever been through. Long story short, my TV stopped working the screen went black. I started a return online and bring my TV to my local Walmart in Goldsboro, NC  but they refused my request because on the order it says that my TV version is a J09 but on my TV it says that it's a J04 so they said that they cannot issue my refund or or even replace the TV show of the people bringing the TV to the house to deliver it because it was a delivery from store type transaction email and everything I had but they said it because the back of the TV said J04 that they could not accept it. I am very upset because Walmart is constantly making errors making mistakes with peo...",1

I see that there are others who have the same issue  Contact walmart, have extended warranty,  walmart said contact vizio.  After several attempts to make it connect, vizio asks for my receipt.  Didn't have it so had to go to walmart for receipt.  Sent receipt and now we wait until vizio gets the part then a technician will come fix it. To me this is probably just the beginning of trouble. Not happy Vizio",1
12/9/2022,"i purchased the V755-H4 in January 21 and after almost 2 yrs this TV has lines going all through the tv. Worst purchased i ever made. Had just purchased a house so didn't have money to get extended warranty. I've had a 48"" vizio for like 8 yrs and no problems. i will NEVER buy another vizio tv and will tell everyone i know.  Vizio is making crap Tvs now",1
12/15/2021,So sorry we had to return cause the picture was great but we had trouble from the start. We had it a week and returned. We had to unplug and restart every time we turned it on. This must be a problem cause a lot of reviews said the same thing. The company needs to fix this problem. We bought a Samsung instead. No problem so far. This was a 65” also.,1
2/16/2022,"I think I have been having bad luck with getting things from Walmart. I purchased this television and could not wait to use it. When the box was delivered it was damaged, the TV was okay so I thought. This should have been the first sign that something was wrong, sending a package looking that horrible showed no care for someone that spent their hard-earned money. On day one of setting up the television, it continued to shut off. Day two it continued, on day three it happened again so I returned it. The quality of products I am getting is not the same and Walmart needs to put care into the products as they did in the past.",1
5/26/2022,"We purchased this tv after our other Vizio died. Had it for a weekend and returned it. Took 5 minutes to turn on, another 10 just to get a channel changed or get to a streaming app. Very hard to watch live stream when you have to go and change the resolution just to center the picture.",1

There are numerous complaints on the internet. It is a constant problem and I have been through all the ""Try This"" scenerios I could find on the internet including firmware updates and Factory Resets without any success. I have firesticks on all my other VIZIO TVs that work fine but this TV is BAD.",1
10/27/2021,"I bought this set to replace an older Vizio set. However, I soon learned that I had made a terrible mistake. Cables and mounting screws were missing from the box. Vizio customer service gave me a difficult time when I attempted to have the pieces sent to me. I gave up in disgust with Vizio's customer reps. The TV itself lacked image clarity, and I constantly had to reboot the set. After three weeks, I returned the set. In my opinion Vizio is no longer the company it once was.",1
8/24/2022,"I get it, you get what you spend, but this tv is well below what you should be looking for even in the bargain department.  The V-series by Vizio is not compatible with most apps that play 4k content.  The remote that came with the tv stopped being the normal vizio remote back in 2018.  This is an older model they are trying to sell off.  Don't fall for it.

When i hooked this tv up and signed into some streaming services i could not believe how awful the picture quality was.  Think early 2000's tube tv.  They didn't standardize the settings.  Ok fine, i went online to look for Vizio's recommended and the first thing that caught my attention was that their instructions do not match the settings menu (I want to stress that this tv is outdate...",1
10/26/2022,What was never disclose was that Vizio chose to take away the rights of buyers to add their favorite apps. They made the choice for us and you can't add any apps you like. This is the single most horrible experience with buying this television. If I'd know before I would NOT have bought the TV.,1
10/9/2022,"Garbage. Had it for about two months. First thing to screw up was the TV not recognizing any of the HDMI inputs when turned on.  Only way to ""fix"" it was to unplug the set for a minute or two then plug it back in.  Second and third things to screw up was loss of audio on HDMI 3. Pic but no sound. A few hours later the same thing happened to HDMI 2. Followed all the trouble shooting procedures and even reset the TV back to factory defaults. Still no audio. Only have one working HDMI input. When it fails I will throw this piece of crap in the garbage and buy a decent TV. It WILL NOT be another VISIO.",1
6/12/2022,"There is so much I don't like about this, where do I start? 
If you will be using this as a ""Roku"" TV (connect to the internet), do yourself a favor and buy a real Roku player and attach the internet to that first. This TV has a crap ""D to A"" converter (the electronics that convert IP packets into picture and sound). I had to use the ""Pluto TV"" (they must use a proprietory protocol that buffers more, I guess) app to watch my news programs because if you try to watch using the ""free TV"" function, you will experience skipping, buffering, pauses and unsyncronized picture and sound. It's not a satisfying experience. 
Another really annoying aspect of this TV is it does not save passwords for  WiFi authentication. EVERY time you want to switch W...",1
10/11/2022,nothing but problems with this TV I have only had it for less then 2 months. constantly have to reboot turn off and back on or wl will not work.  not happy wit it and my return window is past . Could not take it back to store when it started acting stupid. I am 75 and do not drive along with being disabled.  So beware of this TV maybe I just got the lemon of the bunch.,1
8/3/2022,Be careful! TV NEVER received!! I received an email alert advising item delivered and photo attached- Except it was never delivered as stated and NO photo. I was told by Walmart they would do an ‘Internal review ‘ Walmart sends me photos when $4 soap is delivered : Really disappointed with this experience and how it was addressed or rather not really addressed.,1
11/24/2022,"Seriously go pick this up in person. This was my first and last time ordering from Walmart online.  The TV looked like Mike Tyson landed a couple of combos on the screen.  I ordered online to beat the lines and ended up having to go be in the lines anyway. 
The second tv I picked up in person and it's very nice for the price. Just go pick it up yourself",1
10/3/2022,"Had previous positive experience with Vizio but this tv is crap. You think all is fine until one day where you've been streaming shows then go to watch something else and it won't work. Looked up the issue and others have the same problem. 

To fix you have to turn the tv off, unplug, hold power button for 5-10 seconds, plug tv back up, turn tv on and you can resume streaming until you can't. May have to repeat the process. It's infuriating and regret purchasing this product. If you have another option go with it and stay away from this tv.",1

11/5/2022,"Terrible tv. Have had six months, there are lines running through the screen.  It won’t let me add some apps. TCL seems to be a much better choice at a comparable price to the Vizio.",1
5/26/2022,"The worst vizio tv ive ever owned. I dont do reviews but this tv shuts off randomly no matter what source its on. I've done everything right, reset the tv manually bought a new hdmi cable and it continues to shut off. Its going back to the store.",1
11/3/2021,The TV won't stay programmed the volume has to be at 95 out of 100 to hear people talk and you have to program the DVD machine and tv every time you put in another disc to get the volume to work.,1
2/27/2023,"It is no longer working after less than 11 months. I bought this for my elderly mother who is disabled, and living on a fixed income and she is so disappointed. Can someone please contact me and help get this resolved?",1
8/12/2022,"lasted less than a year
dropout lines across screen in all 
red yellow orange pixels 
vizio smart tv takes up too much wifi switched off and use a roku.",1
10/14/2021,It sounds terrible….like lots of bass is in it. I’m extremely disappointed because I just got it. I would not recommend. I’m always hesitant about ordering certain things from Walmart and this is why.,1
12/21/2022,"Have had it less than a year, started spazzing out. Only get tech support telling me to unplug it, plug it in. Waste of my time. Now I need to find receipt to show them it’s under warranty to get a tech to help. Wish I did not buy it.",1
2/10/2024,Very disappointed with the app selection. Cannot download my local news app or even that many apps. Pointless to buy cause I still need to use a streaming stick for certain things. Would love to return but they refuse,1
11/17/2022,"Returned immediately. Screen has large bright spots that made the color is the picture uneven. Thought about overlooking it but no, I’m not keeping a bad tv. Before you put the legs on, please plug up the tv first to make sure the screen is good.",1
9/2/2021,"I literally think the tv has been sitting or dropped. Something is wrong with it. I am unhappy. The tv doesnt recognize remotes , streaming issues and input issues.",1
2/18/2022,"SOUND IS AWFUL... unbearable- no matter how hard you try to adjust the sound in settings. Picture is just ok - nothing special. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR- OVERALL, A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!",1
11/27/2022,"Spots on TV after just a few months of minimal use, and Vizio smart feature goes our way too often where you  cannot access any streaming. I liked Vizios in the past but this one is not good. Will use a different brand going forward.",1
11/24/2022,Lips don't match the sound.  Had the tv for 4 days and the lips won't sync with sound.  I've tried everything suggested online. I'll be starting the return process after thanksgiving!,1
11/15/2022,"Bought the Vizio 50 class v series and 2 and a half months ago.  It has already quit working right. It shows a black screen with the Vizio logo on it every 15-20 seconds. I’ve tried unplugging to reboot, but nothing. Very disappointing!!",1
2/12/2023,"The tv was delivered with no power cord or remote. I had to take tv back to store. Could not take another one as a 65” tv, in box, does not fit in a GMC Terrain. Was horrible experience trying to get this issue resolved.",1
7/9/2022,"Picked up 2 of these TV's on April 1, 2022. Both TV's worked great until July 4, 2022. Neither TV works anymore. Haven't even paid them both off yet and we now have 0 TVs.",1
8/13/2022,I have been buying Vizio tvs for many years with no problems. This tv only lasted me a year and two months. All I have is gray bars now. I would suggest getting the warranty,1
12/27/2022,"In less than a week I have green and red vertical lines starting at the top portion, some go all the way to the bottom, some are shorter. Going to have to send back, which is going to be a HUGE hassle! When will I learn to stick to amazon?",1
12/26/2022,TV was a Christmas present when opened it was broken.   It had been in a safe place and no damage to it since receiving it so in had to  be damage before.  Really disappointed made Christmas really sad.,1
6/5/2022,This was our first time buying a Vizio TV and it will be our last. It freezes constantly and I have to keep unplugging it to get it to work. We've only had it for like 2 weeks.,1
1/17/2023,"We own 5 Vizio tvs. This 50"" TV screen is covered in vertical lines. Can only see half of the screen! Have had the tv for 16 months. The manufacture warranty has expired! I can not find my all state plan! Just blew $400!!",1
8/26/2022,This TV is defective. We can not control the sound on the back of TV or with the remote. TV is very loud and at a fixed volume level. The sound system can not be controlled,1
12/5/2022,"Constantly buffering and having to reboot 10  times a day. Factory reset like they asked. if i kept the box id be returning in a heartbeat. I had bought a 50"" and returned that for a Samsung. Wish I never decided to try something else.",1
9/8/2022,This is the worst model Vizio I've ever had who makes a Big 75 inch tv that can't be mounted on the wall.. Replace it ASAP I Still need it to be 75 inch a Vizio that can be mounted thanks and thanks for ruining my day,1
1/27/2024,I would not recommend this tv! Bought this tv summer 2022. It started showing small lines after a year having it and it continually got worse. The screen went completely black last week and sound still worked. Worst tv I've owned!,1
10/27/2021,Dead on arrival.   Took a lot of time to unpackage and mount.  The tv had the black screen and blinking light. No picture or sound.  I got a dud the one in store looked great.,1
3/16/2022,I just purchased this TV to replace another Vizio that was having a power issue. The TV had to be unplugged and plugged back in to turn it on. After 2 months the new TV is doing the same thing. I should have never purchased another Vizio.,1
7/9/2022,Sound stopped working after 60 days. Had to unplug and then plug it back in to make it work. Definitely would not recommend. I don’t know why Walmart is selling defective TVs. I’m not the only buyer with the same exact problem.,1
3/14/2022,This tv is extremely frustrating.  It stops constantly to reboot.  It gets stuck between functions and you have to wait and let it finally figure it out.  Would never buy Visio again!,1
5/20/2022,Haven’t even had this TV for a year and it is already tore up. About 2 months after we got it it had a large black spot in the upper right hand corner that wouldn’t go away. Now you turn the tv on it’s a completely white screen.,1
7/7/2022,"When you turn on the TV, it doesn't go straight to the home screen. It shows you a blank black screen and won't do anything until you hit ""cancel"" on the remote multiple times. 
So annoying!",1
8/14/2021,I bought two of these televisions both of them develop the same problem with sound not matching the picture and then the sound going out all together.  I'll be returning  them both,1
7/15/2022,i cancelled the order online and by phone and they still are shipping it  ......i want my $412.25 back on my discover card immediately.............im so upset about all this,1
10/6/2022,This brand has a freezing problem. It stops streaming and buffers. We have unlimited high speed internet and our speed it great. You have to soft power off the tv to get it to play again. This is a minimum of twice a day. Wish I could return it,1
1/14/2022,"This was a Christmas present for my parents. It worked for a week then the screen went out. Vizio is replacing it, but it will take 16 days to get the replacement.",1
10/18/2021,"Picture is fine but like all newer 2018 and later Vizio sets, you cannot download apps. My main issue is complete loss of sound almost daily. I have to unplug it and plug it back in to recover sound.",1
7/24/2021,"Seriously. This much money for a “smart” tv that won’t give me these three very basic apps. Oh, their support has a “work-around” - get on you mobile device and smart cast to your tv. Sucks. Seriously. Very unhappy.",1
10/6/2021,No sound on main local channels. I like the size and price. I have to reset it to get the sound to work! Works again then tomorrow broken again. Choose a different tv.,1
7/26/2022,"their software is crap. youre stuck with apps they choose. cant get showtime.
they spam you every day with annoying ads. they regularly brick your tv with ""updates"" so you have to reset and put your info back in. buy something else",1
9/6/2022,Tv came a day later than it said when I ordered it and when I unboxed it the screen was shattered. I love vizio but the delay in delivery with the tv being completely broken ruins it for me. Major bummer.,1
10/13/2022,Still waiting on a return label to ship it back.  Worked for less than three days. They said a return slip would arrive in 3 weeks and it's been more then a month. So I guess I'm stuck with a soundless TV?,1
10/19/2022,"It worked great for the first few months, but now it is malfunctioning. It won't turn on/off sometimes. We have to unplug it and plug it back in at least twice a week to get it to work",1
2/16/2023,"Dont bother it's big and dont work. They want you ""drain"" the TV all the time. Meaning you have to unplug it and hold the power button for 10 minutes utes and plug it back it. Also sling dont work on it either.

Waste of money choose something else.",1
1/6/2023,I bought this tv as a gift a little less than a year ago and i don’t know why but there are so many lines you can see in the screen when you play a movie it’s so annoying and it’s getting worse.,1
11/29/2023,Unfortunately I was very disappointed with my recent purchased.  Had I know from the start that this tv would not support the apps that I use the most as on my previous TV I would have never purchased.  Needless to say I am in the process of returning the TV I purchased.,1
12/6/2023,"I purchased this TV 5 days ago and I took it back today. The picture is fuzzy, the colors terrible, ‎the sharpness is blurry. It was foggy at times. The colors were often non-existent. No matter ‎how I tried to adjust it the picture was never good. Believe me, I tried. I have two other Vizio ‎smart TVs and their pictures are wonderful.  I returned this one (model V555-J01) to the store ‎and bought another Vizio TV and picture is fine on it. I am beginning to think that maybe there ‎was something wrong with this TV from the factory. I would stay away from this model.‎",1
12/1/2023,Have had this tv a little over a year and it's already losing the picture. All the sudden the bottom third started to become slightly different in color and would cycle every 10 seconds between the normal picture and the slightly distorted color in the bottom third. Well 2 days later it was unwatchable. Same thing every ten seconds goes from normal picture to starts distorted then goes full screen weird green scramble all over and then ten seconds later back to normal picture for 10 seconds. Not something I would recommend.,1
12/14/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have Starlink.  It is directly wired to Starlink with RF45 cable.  The speed is 200 mps.  But it takes this tv forever to come on and to load channels.  I'm get bored and tired and leave and forget about it.  Probably gonna throw it on the damned lake,1
11/5/2023,"This TV worked great for almost exactly 2 months and then died. Since this occurred over the 30 day limit of Walmart's return policy for electronic items, my only option was to contact the manufacturer. 

They told me they would replace the TV but wanted me to supply them with a credit card number in order to place a hold on the card for the amount of the purchase price, $238,  and I would need to send the broken TV back to them. They would release the hold after they received the TV.   

Although this might be legitimate, it just seemed a little scammy to me. Why not let me just take it back to Walmart?  What do they do with broken TV's?  Reuse the parts?  

I have been a Walmart customer in person and online for over 30 years since they f...",1
11/25/2023,"I have to unplug this TV every time I turn it on otherwise it will not connect to the internet.  not a very smart TV.  I'm guessing that I just got a ""lemon"" 🍋 🫤. the picture and sound is okay but next time I'll stick with a Roku smart TV.  Sadly I would be hesitant to buy a Vizio again based on the performance of this particular television.",1
11/17/2023,"I unfortunately bought multiple Vizio tv's. 3 for my house and 1 for my parents. All have failed just over a year later. Ranging from channels being lost to horizontal lines in the screen. As it had just been 13 months since buying I called Vizio. Their reply was that I needed to buy new TV's and I was out of warranty. 

Do yourself a favor and stay away from this brand!",1
11/12/2023,"Aesthetically, this TV has great picture, sound and functionality. However, buyers beware! My phone was easily hacked by connecting my phone to thee tvs in my house when we had someone possibly sneaking in, and they were able to completely all my personal and work information while in my own home, spying on me. This I'd also say, did have to do with security through wifi, Bluetooth and the cellular device itself. Still, the TV was a piece of the problem. Please help!!",1
11/25/2023,Was a great TV but they've just released a firmware update that throws all that out the window. It's the update where they moved the input and volume display to the upper right and turned it orange. So dumb. Everytime you turn on the TV it forces you to their ads page instead of returning you to the input you had it on. If you use Alexa integration you can no longer tell her to pause. There is no way to disable auto updates so good luck.,1
10/30/2023,Do not waste your money on a Vizio! Suck it up and spend a few extra bucks on a better brand. I bought a 75in Vizio less than 6 months ago. First thing to go left side speakers blew. Volume never up over 20. Now I'm getting the black screen of death constantly and it's basically up to my tv if I can watch it or not. 10/10 would not recommend,1
11/8/2023,The screen broke and I hadn't had it four months. Vizio wanted a credit card to hold untill I received the new tv. i was told that I would receive the tv and then the next day after holding my credit card hostage for weeks. I was told that I wouldn't receive a new tv. Vizio Tv's have not lasted for me ever. I wish I could give a zero.,1
12/10/2023,"If you view orograms with your TV antenna, you can only use their software which is rife with ads. Turning on this TV takes a good minute. Changing channels has a 3 to 5 seconds. Vizio is in the ad and data collection business according to their website and wikipedia. Choose  another brand of TV.",1
11/17/2023,"Tv worked great for a few months then we had a storm that caused the power to go out, when it came back on again he tv wouldn't connect to the internet. After hours on the phone with Vizio it got connected again. Then 7 months of having the tv it stopped connecting again. A few more hours on the phone with Vizio they said they would send someone out to fix it, a week later they decided they would just send us a new tv instead. Get the new tv, it works on Saturday, then Thursday night there's a power outage, we turn the tv on, won't connect to the internet again. After factory resets and unplugging everything vizio can think to tell me to unplug, it connected Thursday night, woke up Friday morning, won't connect again. Vizio set up another p...",1
11/23/2023,"My Vizio 70” TV is only 5 years old.
Now only color displayed are shades of blue?
Vizio support said nothing will fix the this issue.
Visio support basically told me go pound sand, go buy another TV.
I will never buy ANYTHING from Vizio again and I recommend all to look elsewhere!
Complete waste of $$.
I will always tell everyone I meet, family, friends, students and co-workers.
If you need a TV by ANYTHING but a Vizio.  Vizio is complete crap %26 they do not stand by their product.",1
12/7/2023,"Kid gave us an early Christmas present and I was so happy to get this, that's were the good things stop.  Picture is not so good and actually is nice for a minute and bad the next.  Also the screen goes black and now and then. I will be returning this and looking at a different Brand to buy. I have a Vizio surround sound system and I do love that but no for their TV's.",1
11/14/2023,"I bought this tv a little over a year ago. Had to return it because it kept shutting off or the software wouldn't load. Received another tv, same model/ brand and almost a year later I'm having connectivity issues. About 20 minutes into watching tv it says there's no internet connection. I work from home all day, connected to my wifi, no connection issues at all. Vizio recommended I hire a repair man. I think I'll take that money and go get a Samsung like I should have in the first place.",1
11/13/2023,"The TV physically works fine. It gets a one star because the brilliant minds at Vizio made it mandatory to install a new update which makes you want to pull your hair out. The software is janky. Always wants to default to their Home Screen, when turning on the TV. That is after I’ve changed it in settings. Sound quality is garbage.  Pay the extra $25 and get a different brand.",1
11/9/2023,"Warning:  I purchased a vizio 58"" at bestbuy on closeout.  It failed 11 months later.  Any vizio bought on closeout (at least from that retailer) does not have a warranty even though it is brand new.  TCL and Hisense both
give a warranty on their sets as long as they are new regardless of sale status.  I didn't check other manufacturers.  It is best to check with the manufacturer for warranty terms and get it in writing on sale items. 3601673",1

I spoke to someone through vizio and they just asked me to do everything I had already tried. They then told me it would possibly be more expensive to fix the tv and I needed to purchase a new one. A warranty was out of the question because vizio only backs their product for 1 year!! Only 1 year!?!? Yeah, I'll happily go elsewhere for a new TV and wouldn't recommend this hunk of junk to my worst enemy.",1
11/19/2023,The region is limited to US and I have to return it since I wanted it for my home in Mexico. The smart tv becomes a “dumb” tv. You can’t use the full functions. Also the analog cable looks terrible. This tv is not what I expected. The old tv I have has a better image. The image wasn’t nice and it was tedious to try to get it to work only to know it’s a region problem that can’t be solved.,1
11/2/2023,"This seemed to be a deal but had become a disaster. It seems that in order for the Vizio Watchfree Hub to work properly, you need the internet. So, we connected the television to our wifi. That was an issue from the start. Then i connected it with an ethernet cord directly to our cable modem. After about 3 months, a message would come on the screen that there was no connection. After getting our service provider involved and getting a new modem from them, things seemed fine. We stream from the apps on the television; Dusney , Hulu, Paramount , YouTube, etc. The television freezes and doesn't respond when you use the remote or the physical buttons periodically. I have to unplug the unit, wait, and then plug it back up. This happened about 3 ...",1

11/1/2023,"All I can say is ""WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK!""
 We got it home and after 2 hours still couldn't get the thing to work.  Even called customer support for Vizio and as you can imagine, that was an absolute nightmare! they were no help at all and in the end agreed that we were wasting our time and should return the TV.

I have to keep unplugging the stupid thing to get it to work for awhile. NOT OK. My father has one only a different size and his is stupid too!

I did online research and took over 1-1/2 hours to do all of the trouble shooting steps and still zippo. Of course I can get support but honestly, I am a person who works 70-80 hours week - fitting in a customer service appointment is stressful and frankly shouldn't be needed with a brand new TV.

Thankfully we have a small sound bar and can get sound from it and also the TV is still under warranty.,1
7/7/2023,Buyer beware and make sure you have them check the serial number on TV to make sure it matches one on box prior to purchase. Purchased this TV in Store and got home to discover screen was shattered. Took it back to store and customer service would not issue refund due to serial number not matching. I my opinion this was a recirculated return and I got Screwed for the bill. Thanks Walmart!!!!!,1
7/4/2023,I bought this after our 2018 LG TV started malfunctioning and I hate this TV. It's too difficult to watch regular TV. You have to hit a button 4-5 times to get to TV channels. It never connects to our regular cable channels without downloading them all over again. And beware the interface of this TV has so many ads built in to it. It is so annoying! I guess that's why the price point of Vizio is so much lower than other brands because they are making their revenue in advertising. I am going to return this TV and set my old LG back up. So disappointing.,1
10/15/2023,I bought this TV in Nov. 2022 and it started giving me problems a few months ago. Sometimes the tv won’t turn on. Have to unplug for awhile in order to get it to work. Now today none of the apps will work and it’s now giving me an error code for smart cast. This TV is worthless 👎🏾,1
7/30/2023,I bought this TV right about a year ago. It just doesn't turn on anymore. Idk why. When I reached out to Vizio they told me my serial number is from August 2021 and I bought the TV in July of 2022. So either I bought a used TV from Wal Mart or vizio has there information incorrect. Either way I will not be buying vizio products any longer. The smart cast system always has issues and there has been a problems with it from the start. Good luck in your future TV shoppers and have a good day.,1
9/26/2023,"Vizio has a bad habit of accessing TVs via the internet to 'update' the software.    A few months ago, they did one of these 'updates' and the set is just junk ever since.

I called tech support, and they told me I had to contact something called Just answers (or something like that). They told me it was $1 and it was the only way I could get help. It was a scam, and they tried to take $50 out of my account 3 times. My bank blocked it all three times. I still have to buy another TV as this one is crap. Don't buy anything from Vizio.",1
10/7/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My TV completely stopped working less than one year after I purchased it. It’s completely black I cannot see anything and I reached out to try to check to see if it was still under warranty. It is under warranty since it’s under the one-year mark but Vizio makes it almost impossible to submit a request online. I contacted the representative multiple times and submitted more than one request and none of them went through and I received no confirmation and then my request that finally went through was closed out after they sent me some bs troubleshooting article that didn’t work. So they recommended I buy a new TV even though the TV is still under warranty. Honestly a complete waste of time ...,1

7/16/2023,The only reason I gave it one star was because zero stars wasn't available. The TV was completely fine for 12 months. When 13 months rolled around it faded to black while watching tv one day. I tried to use Vizio Support to fix the issue and they led me through a variety of ways to try to get the picture back. The issue could never be resolved so at first Vizio gave us hope by saying that they would either repair or replace the TV due to a defect. Then I was notified that since I had the TV for 13 months they would not honor their warranty and there was nothing they would do for us. Highly disappointed as I have bought 4 Vizio TVs over the years. I will never buy another. They have lost a lifetime customer.,1
9/5/2023,Vito tv's on average last 6-7 years mine lasted 1. The rating should be negative 5 stars. The whole time it worked you would have to unplug it wait and plug it back in. The support center said it's fine and it happens and there was nothing to do about it. As soon as the warranty expired the screen cut off and wouldn't come back on. I tried all the steps to make it work. There is so much ring with these tv's there's a whole website to help you turn the thing back on. It is a very common issue with Vizo tv's I didn't know about. So save your money and buy a nice tv from a good brand that won't screw your over. I literally have a plasma tv that's 20 years old that still works perfectly and vizo can't figure out one that lives longer than a hou...,1

We purchased one, and after setting it up, realized there were bad pixels in the middle of the screen. We returned it to the store and got another one. The replacement had light leaking from the sides and waves in the screen, almost like the screen wasn't properly attached during assembly. We returned the replacement to the replacement and found the 2021 model. No issues since.",1

It still has color in sections, but the colors are not the right color (For example, orange colors appear red, about 40 percent of the screen is blue/purple). Contacted Vizio, and they said ""sorry"", and that was that. I have bought a 4 Vizio tv's over the last 10 years, and this same thing happened to 3 of them. Time to start buying a new brand.",1

8/17/2023,This TV is JUNK! Had lines by the 3rd month. They replaced it and the new one developed lines in a year.

I have found out the hard way.,1

Ordered the Vizio Smart TV 65” new, and got a USED, BROKEN, DIRTY, TCL missing the power cord and the remote, all inside of a Vizio box.

 Of course I did not know this was the product I had ordered. Now I have to deal with a broken, incorrect, unusable TV just sitting around. 

It was delivered to me as after I ordered it for pickup; then they said pickup wasn't available; then I thought everything was fine after it was delivered - until I opened it up and was about to start mounting it. 

Never buying from Walmart again…",2

But the fact that only 2 months after buying it new the screen started going out in spots, then can streaks across the screen, flashing spots, and lines from side to side top to bottom constantly changing. You cannot use it for anything I bought it for. You cannot see a clear picture anymore. I’ve tried resetting it to factory, I’ve tried updating it but nothing works. Even with a 4yr warranty I have yet to get it replaced, last time I tried they canceled out my claim mid way. Not sure if it was time limited or what.",2

It will also go from the volume I have selected to really loud on its own. You ask why I have not returned it? I am almost 70 and getting it in the car would be very difficult at best. I put my old tv in this ones box and my brother came and helped get rid of it. Hate this tv!,2

Dislikes: Strong electoric smell when in use, noticeable humming when tv is used for extended time.

Apps like Disney, Netflix, Hulu, Max, Sling. I wanted a TV that I could load with MY apps, not decided on by Vizio. You can't add any, and you can't remove any either! The remote is very slow to respond as well. I'll keep the tv for a while and then give it to a family who needs one. I will not buy another Vizio though.",2

I do not have a very big living room and I have to have the volume up to at least 60-65 . Crazy. Also doesn't want to change channels or sources not sure why.

We get there to be told our order was cancelled. Called customer service and she was busy so hung up on us.  I went inside and found a sales associate willing to help. She found that another store had the tv so we drove to a store farther away and was able to purchase it.  I will say the stress is high with the workers on black Friday. Beware.",2

11/18/2023,"The actual hardware of this TV is nice. It has a gorgeous picture, and a really nice and sturdy feeling construction. It looks and FEELS like a premium tv, which is impressive at this price

Where it falls apart is the OS this tv runs. Unlike the Roku OS, which has a simple homescreen that shows your apps and recent inputs, this Home Screen is annoying crap that gets in the way

It’s mostly movies and tv shows it’s trying to shove down your throat, and the app bar is shoved out of the way.

Worst of all, it comes pre installed with tons and tons of apps, and you can’t delete any of them!!! Junk like “FailArmy” are permanently on my TV and in the way when I just want to access YouTube, Hulu, and Netflix. It’s an absolute pain.",2

The TV even plays while I'm sleeping most nights. 

These lcd screens have come a long way recently. I've got a large competitors panel in a family room and although it's priced a bit higher the difference in screen detail and artifact problems is significant. This Vizio model has done nothing to address black bleed and serious edge blurring problems I coups have overlooked in older panels.

1/19/2024,I ordered the V655-J09 and the gave me the V655-J04.  I read online WAL-MART has done that to a lot of folks.  Pretty shady if you ask me.  Disappointed!,2

7/28/2023,there is a issue with the HDR 10 SETTINGS  ON XBOX SERIES X there is a fix allowing you to enable the setting buy opening the Netflix app and changing the setting but still a very frustrating software problem that VIZIO doesn't seem to care enough about to update the tv 😑 that definitely would have made me return the tv if i didn't dig very deep on forums to find a fix other than that works great and am happy with it,2
10/1/2023,"Once it's on it functions okay. Sometimes it takes a few tries and a power cycle from the toolkit page to get it to show the home screen. Also, it won't turn off. It turns off, then five seconds later turns back on. So to turn it off you have to unplug it. I would return it but by the time I had a chance to deal with it, the return window had closed. Overall I don't recommend it if you watch much tv. It was cheap and I don't use it much, so I'll just live with it. But I definitely wouldn't buy it again.",2
3/24/2023,wish I hadn't bought this tv. it constantly loses connection to the Bluetooth headphones and or speaker. if I cast something to it like a movie or something from YouTube it skips constantly. nothing seamless about it at all. I constantly have to reboot it so that it will see other devices or stay connected. probably the worst purchase I've ever made as far as the TV goes.,2
4/21/2023,"This television worked perfectly for about a week or two and then the screen would turn white, no picture at all but the sound would still be heard. Day by day the screen would stay blank for longer periods of time and it would occur more frequently. 
My brother researched online to troubleshoot and we discovered that the problem had something to do with the backlight inside of the television. So this particular television had a defect of some kind so it was returned to Walmart and I bought a 65 inch TCL, which was over a hundred dollars cheaper.",2
7/7/2023,"I bought this TV less than 2 months ago and it will not power on. Called manufacturer and they tried through the internet with no luck. Now they want to send a repair tech out, which was 2 days ago since I was told this and have yet to hear from anyone.",2
8/23/2023,"You better be on point with these delivery guys because they would deliver your package, but they don't knock.  Good thing my husband was there and heard them at the door.   By the time he got to the door, the delivery guy was getting back on the elevator.",2
8/16/2023,"arrived damaged in box with a large dent on the tv box itself. the tv case was damaged and pulled the frame away from the screen. also i requested must sign for delivery and the driver dropped it off on my neighbor's porch instead and deleted the sign request Other then that, it  is a good brand and otherwise works good. This is definitely a fedex delivery issue.",2
9/5/2023,"Terrible picture, it needs to be adjusted for all aspects of color and brightness every time you change programs and also many times when scenes change. I have been very satisfied with a Vizio TV I had in the past but this is the worst tv for picture quality I have ever owned.",2
7/30/2023,My purchase came as expected but when I unboxed it and tried to use it the device did not power on. I had ti box it back and borrow a neighbor's truck to bring it back. The Walmart that I went to closest to my house only had the bigger models so was force due to time constraints on spending more money and having to use another person's vehicle due the the size purchase.,2
8/7/2023,"So the TV works OK. Not great. The resolution is no better than our old one that died (1080ppi), and this is supposed to be a 2160ppi resolution. It's disappointing.

Streaming is okay. So far, no buffering. The drawbacks are as follows... 
1.) The screen ratio/dimension is smaller than our old one even tho it is the same size - 43""
2.) Amazon Prime Video, the screen display ratio is even worse. The picture doesn't fill the screen - you get the old top and bottom black bars - ""cinema or widescreen view"" even tho the TV is a widescreen 16:9 ratio. Go into settings, and you have one option for screen display - ""Normal"" - and nothing else, so you can't really adjust it. Why even offer it, if you can't adjust it. Pointless.

It took me a while ...",2
9/19/2023,"Tv arrived from spark delivery - Which isn't a bad thing but,I had set it up for freight shipping. 
When I opened the Vizio tv everything looked 100% fine but when I tried to turn it on either with the remote or manually the light would come on and go dim and the screen would make a weird computer sound and nothing /( -had to set up return with Measrk freight they picked up but have not been credited back yet- its been since labor day almost 2. Weeks",2
10/16/2023,"I purchased the TV and it was delivered the next day.  I ordered the mounting service add on. It was scheduled to be wall mounted two days after I received it.  Two weeks later it still sat in the box.  Multiple calls to Walmart and Angi (as in Angi's list) Walmart's service provider got me little help.  Walmart said it wasn't their problem it was an issue with the installer.  I pointed out that I bought it from them not Angi.  I was told it was in the fine print and I that I had signed.

It's just too much trouble to explain here.  Just don't get the add on mounting service. Trust me.",2
4/20/2023,I do not like the way the picture looks it’s not exactly clear like maybe a Samsung I used to have. And when you turn it’s a two-step program.  You hit the power button and you have to hit another button and then arrow down to when you get to the HMDI. It was cheap that’s what I got,2
6/9/2023,"The tv has a great picture and volume is good. However, overall it has been a very disappointing and frustrating purchase. Hardly any of the apps work on it. I cant watch Netflix, HBO Max, or Hulu. Screenshare also does not work. Its extremely frustrating. I would return if I could.",2
8/19/2023,For some reason the picture on this TV is just bad. I can't get the tones and sharpness adjusted and it keeps telling me it is format unsupported. I have never had this kind of trouble with a Vizio. So disappointed. I will probably return it if possible.,2
12/18/2023,"Didn’t even have it for 2 years , randomly started glitching purple lines and had this hot  spot in the bottom right corner .",2
2/16/2024,"It's a nice tv, but was advertised as Roku tv.  It doesn't have Roku channel!  I am planing on returning.",2
2/2/2024,I would not buy this t v again. The picture is grainy and the sound is terrible. It will not let me use my Alexa remote.,2
2/6/2024,"I received a J04 TV according to the Model %23 on the back. Please get back to me on this ASAP. Also, very frustrating and difficult on set up.",2
1/11/2024,"The sound is bad, and ONLY Roku wireless speakers are compatible.",2
11/15/2023,The response time is so slow it makes you think the TV was turn off amd then back on. There is over a 6 sec delay when switching inputs and about 4-6 seconds in between channels. not good,2
11/19/2023,Sound on this tv is horrible. I wish I had bought at store instead of online I would definitely take it back.  The sound is so. Cheap   Would not buy again,2
11/3/2023,Not even a week later we turned the tv on and there was a fat lines running through it. We turned it on and off and it did go away. Volume is ridiculously low. Will be returning this ASAP.,2
11/28/2023,nice young man but his mother was rushing him. did not deliver to my door. i tipped for said delivery. they were going to leave the tv out side. with noone. not even bring it to my apt door. a little angry about this woman.,2
3/11/2023,"Budget monitor, worked well for almost 2 years, however the screen burns out and freezes (see photo). This was my first budget TV and further justifies paying for quality hardware versus cheapest.",2
12/23/2023,"The corners are very light,sound is awful, picture quality is definitely NOTHING to rave about. I give this product a D-",2
6/13/2023,"The feet are not very supportive. The tv was not very stable so when the table got bumped over it went, and the screen was destroyed. Sigh. The picture was nice, the sound quality was not great, but until it fell over it was acceptable.",2
10/8/2023,The delivery was delayed a day. The delivery was sent to wrong pick up point. The remote control was defected. Walmart was unable to replace remote without refunding the TV. I had to pay an outside business to get a replacement remote.,2
10/23/2023,picture was nice. everything was good for 4 days. then iheart would randomly come up no matter what hdmi port i was on. would not buy this tv again. and definitely would not recommend to my worse enemy.,2
9/6/2023,It's an okay TV. I don't like that there are some apps it won't allow you to download. It blocks apps in order to make you pay for the service through Vizio. For example I have ESPN  as a bundle with Hulu and it won't allow me to add it to the TV.,2
10/13/2023,I've ordered 2 TV and both were damaged during shipping. So I don't see myself ordering another TV its a hassle for the carrier to pickup the damaged item. And takes 3 weeks for them to issue my refund,2
9/30/2023,Everything worked mechanically very poor picture not bright one time. It was cloudy next time it would be OK. Just a very poor choice. Some people have had good luck I didn't.,2
9/20/2023,"The TV had a lot of problems and I had to return it. It was not comparable with DIRECTV and video game consoles, but it may have just been this one faulty TV.",2
7/25/2023,i bought the TV online without ever seeing the picture quality.  i went into the Wal-Mart store and was very unimpressed with the picture quality as i mentioned.  i wound up returning it for another brand and larger screen size.,2
9/11/2023,"The volume key does not work properly, often when turning volume up it goes all the way up or if turning down goes all the way down, happens to my other Vizio tvs too.",2
5/28/2023,I have not owned this tv for 90 days and every day now for 4 days I have to reset the tv everyday to watch digital cable. It resets to analog.I have tried everything from unplugging power and cable. It has a great picture but now it's my headache since I didn't purchase a warranty.,2
3/2/2023,"Not great for 4K gaming or devices that use HDMI 2.1 for 4K. The latest update prevents you from using HDMI overrides because they go back to auto.

Other than this issue, it's a great tv. Maybe future updates will fix it but unsure if they will come anytime soon.",2
3/20/2023,"I had this tv for a few weeks and never could get anything to load or work correctly. Checked Wi-Fi connection, everything was connected and working properly with that, so my connection was not the problem. Set up for the tv took a very long time as it stayed on the same loading screen with no progress for a quite awhile. Finally set up was complete and we made it to the main screen of the tv where there were so many apps that it clogged up functioning of the main menu. When I would click on a show or an app like prime video for example, it would go to open but sit on the loading screen and never load or open. So I never really got to watch anything on it, I took it back and purchased a 50” Hisense Roku tv that I have absolutely no issues w...",2
3/15/2023,"Loved this TV when I first got it. But over the past 2 months, the built-in Chromecast has been significantly becoming more and more difficult to get to work. I should not have to turn on/off my TV and phone multiple times to get a show to cast. Yes they are on the same network, yes my network connection is great, yes it is right next to the router. The issue is the built-in Chromecast SUCKS. I pulled out my old (likely around 10 years old at this point) Chromecast and VIOLA - works perfectly. 

The reason I bought this specific brand/model was for the built-in Chromecast. Really disappointed that it's gone to poop after 2 months. Wish I would've purchased a less expensive option, this was not worth the higher price tag.",2
6/19/2023,"Not very happy! I paid for a brand new tv for delivery %26 received one that was clearly open box/previously returned. Nothing was wrapped properly, everything was thrown in the box. If I wanted to pay for an open box tv I would have went to Best Buy!",2
3/28/2023,"I loved this TV at first. It was easy to set up, even adjusting whatever I had to do to align speaking with lips moving. But lately it's been not good. It won't load, constantly lagging, screen is black, says network unavailable, even though it shows it's connected. I feel like I'm rebooting every day, sometimes multiple times. It's not my internet connection, as I bought a new router and everything else in my house connected to Wi-Fi works great. It's sad because I spent more for a great brand name, and now feel like I should have stuck with a cheap Tv. They might die after a few years, but at least I never had all these issues.",2
6/19/2023,NETWORK LOST error message shows up ever so often. it is annoying. When connection is reestablished the movie/ show we are watching does not go back to where we left off. The picture is not always clear either.  I wish I could return the tv but Walmart denied my return since it is out of box.,2
6/8/2023,"I had bought a 65"" Vizio TV %26 Soundbar about 7yrs ago %26 had np. I actually still use the soundbar, great sound still. But this new TV, is 70"" of just bad coloring. The pic quality is not sharp everything is dull no matter which setting I use. Not to mention the static in the speakers. I stream wayyyy too much. So that pic matters immensely to me! I don't like the saying ""You get what u pay for!"" But in this case, I did. The deal isn't worth it!. I literally had the TV for 2hrs. before making the ultimate decision to return it! Back to square one!",2
5/26/2023,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! had the tv for less than a month and the remote started acting up when I put the volume down it goes all the way down and when I put it up it goes all the way up. When I play movies it plays and pauses the movies even when the batteries aren’t in the remote and I cast the movie from my phone. I searched for my problem online and it seems to happen to a lot of people. But at your own risk.,2
3/29/2023,I was supposed to get it yesterday but no drivers were picking up in the evening because according to store employees it's hard to get drivers for evening pick ups they prefer morning. Well why do they even schedule evenings then . The drivers who delivered this morning did a great job .,2
5/16/2023,You get what you pay for??? I decided to buy a tv with a low price. Well the old Vizio I had was better than this.. I had zero buffering on my old tv so I am getting sick of it too fast! Always accidentally hitting the Vizio page central when I was trying to get somewhere else.,2
1/26/2024,We replaced the remote twice and the third one doesn't work either,2
2/18/2024,There was no manual in the box to show how to set up the tv,2

11/4/2022,I’ve been a liyal fan of Vizio products like a have 32’ inch lcd tv for 20 years and gave it to my aunt in the philippines. But when I bought this model after 6 months of use horizontal lines came out of nowhere and then there are times the tv went black like right now cant use this useless tv. I was impressed on the 1st generation of vizio tvs’ but this generation is kind of cheaply made. I hope Vizio will fix their products,2
12/8/2023,i usually love this brand i guess i just gor a lemon this time and the seller doesnt have any more to replace it 😔,2
11/24/2023,"I bought it because of same day delivery, then after the purchase, they pulled the “sorry for the delay” routine, and promised 2 days later!",2
11/30/2023,I hope the 75 inch tv that they delivered today on the porch isn't getting wet its raining outside and has been for a while,2
12/12/2023,I do not like that it keeps blinking out when watching my favorites  show  just  brought TV 2 weeks ago. 😑,2

7/29/2023,No able to download ESPN or ESPN plus.  If you like sports.  Do not get this tv.  So not worth it.  Gives you junk sport apps.,2

6/6/2023,"Thought this was a good tv.  Found out that Vizio does not update the apps enough, so isdues come up like slowness loading, connection issues etc.   going to return this and get a different brand with roku.  this does not have roku also.  not happy",2
3/5/2023,Tv was delivered at someone else's door no text or knock from delivery company so it sat outside for hours anyone could have taken it everything else I have delivered here from Walmart always ends up at the right door,2

6/9/2023,This set reminds me of the older 720p plasma screens. The picture is just not great no matter how you tweak the settings. Going to try and exchange for another Hisense.,2
3/20/2023,Please do not purchase this TV if you are using the Spectrum APP.  It doesn't work with out ROKU or a TV Spectrum box.  The quality is fine but the sound is not.  I had to purchase a sound bar.,2

5/6/2023,"Vizio TV is supposed to be a good TV which is no problem I've had a vizio before and had no problems with it, however this model had problems with it and within 24 hours I knew I needed to take it back because the problems were ones I didn't want to deal with. I went and bought a Samsung Instead",2
9/1/2021,"I am looking to return if I can.  Have to change inputs most of the time to change functions. Remote sticks, TV freezes up. Big thing is picture has a lot to be desired.  Even in streaming services, the picture is poor quality. Has numerous settings for pictures and have tried them all.  I am looking to return if I can. Remote sticks as well.  I have had Vizio in the past and was of better quality. I am not very happy with purchase.",2
9/13/2021,"Aside from being the right size I wanted, the good stops there. So far I have had to unplug it twice to reset it and I have only had it two days. The first time was when I had watched YouTube using my phone through the TV. The next morning anything I selected by using the Input button on the remote would show up just a black screen. Unplugging for a few seconds corrected. Last night I used my dvd player last. This morning no sound would work on any input. Again, unplugging solved. I had to rent a UHAUL to get this TV home and I have no way to return without a lot of expense. So I will use that frustration to let others know about how my latest VIZIO tv is working. I have really liked my old 55"" VIZIO. But this new 75"" V Series isn't looking...",2
7/2/2021,Initially wasn't happy about the picture but comparing to our 12yr old Vizio LCD 720p screen it was a step up of course. Aside from that we liked the format of the screen and silly as it may seem we liked the remote. After 2 weeks the TV would factory reset itself and we would have to download and log in to all our streaming apps again. After the 4th occurrence in 3 weeks we decided to return. Picked up another brand that also makes my cell phone and the difference is night and day in the picture and for just a couple dollars more. Really disappointed in Vizio After realizing what's out there.,2
10/16/2022,Delivery was better than a very disappointing TV. ! I was replacing a 10 year old 42”Vizio. The reliability leaned me to the Vizio.What a bad choice!Its not worth it to look at a bigger tv with the same screen.Honestly all the 4K UHD is not discernible.The border is still BIG,2
7/13/2021,"I returned this tv after owning it for only 3 days.  First, let me say that I know I bought a inexpensive tv.  But I didn't expect it to be largely unreliable in the first week. I have no complaints about the picture quality but the audio was disappointing.  I could definitely see a sound bar in my future.  My biggest complaint though was with the operation.  My second day, I could not get ANY programs or movies to play.   It would load for quite a while, but then it would ask me to make another selection.  The same thing happened no matter which app I tried.   Day 3, it would play programs but now the voice command feature wouldnt work.  And even though I could see that Pandora was playing a song, there was no audio.  And this right after ...",2

A recurring reason is because the lips on people's faces doesn't match their words?  Also, I reboot constantly whenever switching from my Roku app to live Antenna Television.

1/18/2024,"Worked fine… for the first year. Should've gotten the protection plan. The TV had all kinds of new apps the old one didn't (which was also Vizio), automatically switches to the HDMI when the device is turned on, Chromecast, Appleplay, I thought I hit the gold mine. Then the lines started appearing. Then the screen started glitching, freezing, wouldn't play, loosing sound, or simply refusing to turn on. Old one also has minor problems, but lasted longer, and still works better.",2

2/3/2024,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] We purchased the v655 last January and we are disappointed. The picture and sound are ok, but the audio sinc is terrible. The sinc issue is with both antenna and cable (Comcast) connections. We've tried just about every adjustment known to mankind with no significant improvement. Reducing resolution did help at the expense of picture quality. 
 We purchased a Vizio 36” fourteen years ago and still going strong. The new tv will be replaced very soon. Sorry Vizio.",2
6/7/2022,"Have had this TV for about 10 days and will be returning it. Will not work properly with external devices even though hooked up properly. Cannot use our Roku device because the TV will suddenly lose connection to it several times. Cannot use our surround sound system even though directly wired together. Cannot add additional apps to the TV such as Pureflix and since I can't use my Roku I can no longer watch that streaming service. The only positive thing I can say is the screen is clear, good color and easy to hang on the wall bracket.",2
9/7/2021,Started having problems with this TV right away.  Constant software problems.  Have to reboot the TV every couple days because the sound is out of sync.  Vizo only has a few streaming apps but tons of advertisements on the home screen.  They say you need to use smart cast to stream from your phone's app but it doesn't work half of the time.   The remote is cheaply made and the buttons don't work a lot of the time either.,2
2/5/2024,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great picture but the home screen is temperamental. Apps keep freezing and I have to unplug my TV in order to get them to work.

So, I returned the very next day

Pros: good picture and sound

If you want to add your ouwn suscription channels, do not buy it",2
12/13/2022,"I hate this unit. Constant reset..constant ""accept t Dr MS and conditions""..I find it difficult to move around in. The power cord would not hook up and getting the back off the remote was near impossible. This TV will be getting returned on Thursday to a local store.",2
1/20/2022,"Best thing about this purchase was the price.
Performance is another matter.
Lacks detailed channel programming info.
Constantly looses connection to sound bar, reset needed to regain sound
While selecting input source TV just locks up, again rest needed.",2
12/3/2022,"I 've only brought this TV 6 months ago and now suddenly there's no picture when I turn the TV on. I have tried to rest this and still don't work. Now I'm waiting on Vizio tech support to contact me for repair. I've had other smaller  Vizio TVs and they worked great and lasts a long time. This is my 1st 50 inch TV, and this happens after only 6 months. Disappointing!",2
2/3/2024,"First thing, if you have a gaming console this tv was hard to set up. I had to change alot of my settings on my PlayStation 5 to make it work. I would also get a random green screen every two days. Finally the tv backlight stopped working after having it for just 15 days. I reached out to Vizio and they're sending me a new tv but I still see more problems on the horizon. Quality was good when it was working though.",2
2/9/2022,"Picture quality is good. The sound is too low. I have to turn the volume to 100 to hear conversations on movies even with a Vizio sound bar. Unable to hear local channels casting from my phone. To compare, my Sony volume never goes above 20. Pre loaded apps are fine but unable to download apps to this television. You can cast from your phone but it doesn't help when someone visits and you need your phone. I had the tv less than 2 months and it completely stopped connecting to the internet. Customer Service walked me through everything I had tried prior to making the call. Ended up uploading my receipts to Vizio 2 days ago and not sure what I'm waiting for.",2
12/15/2021,This TV seems like a great value in buying it but it has been nothing but a nightmare. Decent picture and sound atleast. The TV is consistently glitchy it must be rebooted at least once every 48 hours as it will simply freeze. Spend the money on a TV with better software,2
8/21/2021,"I really researched before I got this particular tv. I had a 32” for 9 years but wanted to upgrade to not only a larger tv but a smart tv. The size,  picture and free channels are great but set up was frustrating because it kept getting stuck on “restarting your tv” and it took 3 tries to get passed that. So let’s move on to why Vizio can’t seem to get the speakers right. Volume is perfect while on cable but as soon as I flipped over to SmartCast, I have to crank the volume to over 80 just to hear it and I’m really not that far from the tv. So I bought a sound bar. Unfortunately I bought a Vizio sound bar and it’s just as crappy as the tv speakers. If I hadn’t lost the receipt for the sound bar and still had the tv box, these items would no...",2
10/3/2022,I HAVE HAD MY VIZIO TV SENSE JUN 21 /22 WORED FINE FOR 3 MONTHS EXCEPT FOR ACTING A LITTLE SLOW GOING FROM ONE THING TO ANOTHER STARTING THE LAST 3 DAYS IT LOCKS UP SOM TIMES WHEN I TURN IT ON OR AS I CHANGE INPUTS WHEN IT LOCKS UP THE TV WILL NOT SHUT OFF EVEN WHEN I PUSH THE SHUT-OFF BUTTON ON THE TV SO I HAV T0 UNPLUG THE TV AND PLUG IT BACK IN TO GET IT TO WORK HOPEFULLY I CAN SOM HELP BY CALLING WALMART,2
7/21/2021,I bought this tv to use as a presentation screen for groups. The price was nice. The picture quality is pretty good. The sound is a bit as large as I would like. But the part that is really not good is that I can't disable the apps. Nor can get any other apps. I might have to return it.,2
7/1/2021,Features on box are misleading. TV has to be rebooted each time it’s turned off overnight. Takes forever to reconnect to internet. Still have to use Firestick due to limited apps.  Picture quality is just okay. Called Vizio regarding rebooting and they say nothing is wrong but sooo update overnight when they have resolved issue.,2
7/15/2022,I have this same tv in a 50 inch. it has bluetooth so i can listen to the tv and not disturb anyone. i bought the 65 inch and it does not have bluetooth. very disappointed. i have disposed of the box and packaging. Dont know how i can exchange it at Walmart now.,2
11/28/2021,this series of Vizio is giving me all kinds of trouble with WiFi and picking up my network. its not my internet connection because they've been out many times. also i have another Vizio tv in another room and it works fine. is there anything I can do with this problem. thanks. KW,2
1/4/2023,"This 50 was my third Vizio, albeit my first 4k ""smart"" tv. I've got a 55 and 36 in both 1080p which were of the highest quality when I bought them. So, as a pro audio-video technophile, I've been very happy with the detailed adjustment parameters on the Vizio menus and expected this same thoughtfulness in design from this new model.

That said, I'm really upset with  the audio output through the set speakers is defective- the speakers sound blown on vilume setting 45 of 100 with vibrating and distortion- should not be coming out of a brand new TV irregardless of the source. I've spent a few hours troubleshooting and isolating to arrive at this conclusion but haven't yet decided what to do. Am I missing something here? How could Vizio be thi...",2
2/19/2022,"On startup this TV looks for input from the last input port it used.  So, if one uses the HDMI ARC port for the same manufacturer’s 5.1 soundbar system, it requires selecting an input source each time one starts it up.  And the remote control’s input selection button doesn’t work until after the TV goes through various vacillations and tells the user it’s receiving no input from the HDMI ARC port.  And one never knows when or whether other remote buttons will work or what other various vacillations the TV will do under other circumstance.  And it underutilizes the rear two of the five speakers the 5.1 designation designates.",2
8/4/2022,this is the second Vizio TV in the last year and a half and I've had this one for 4 months the old 55 in Vizio kept glitching and glitching and glitching and glitching until it finally went out and I had no picture it lasted exactly a year now I ordered another one which I have in my living room now and it's glitching where I have to unplug it and plug it back in in order to watch TV quite often as far as I'm concerned they're garbage what a disappointment beautiful picture works great except for you lose the picture quite often,2

3. We bought this for our daughter who moved to another state. Did not realize that in 2022, this Smart TV brand was made without the ability to add apps!=0 stars.

7/18/2021,"This TV crams ads in your face. I do not have any online services, I just need a TV to watch my personally owned media whether by DVD or on my home server. The Vizio V series does not allow you to remove things like Peacock, Netflix, Disney , etc. There are more than 20 apps that you cannot remove. Their content constantly flashing in your face. The remote has six shortcut buttons which are useless to anyone without the service which Vizio was paid to put on it. You have a Hulu account and no Crackle account? That's too bad, you get a Crackle button on your remote. If you want to see only relevant content to you personally, go with a different brand. It seems that the Android TVs are fairly customizable, as should be expected. Keep in mind,...",2
5/15/2022,"This is a great tv don't get me wrong but there are issues. To begin with, if you leave the tv on for an extended period of time, say overnight, you will have to reset your tv by unplugging it. This happens quite frequently unfortunately. Sometimes the tv will freeze and power down, it will then not power on unless you unplug it. Now the issue is the audio, I powered my tv on after being gone all day and now my audio isn't working and you won't believe what I did to fix it! That's right unplug once again! It's seems the only way to fix the issues to unplug and start over. I've only had this tv for about a month and wish I would have spent the extra money on a Samsung. With that being said beware before you buy.",2
11/28/2022,"This is our fifth Vizio TV, and the first one that is a disappointment. The claim of 4k fidelity is a joke. There's no detail or sharpness in the picture, it almost seems as though the focus is a little off, or it's displaying at a lower resolution (according to the system info, it isn't).  

Adding injury to insult, I went online to their support page, and they handed me off to the JustAnswers website - which charged me $46 just to tell me to re-read the manual or return the TV.  

It gets two stars because it actually works with all the Smartcast and streaming apps - albeit with the ""soft focus"" display issue.  I could get pretty much the same functions with a $30 Roku stick. The price was right, but I would NOT recommend this model to an...",2

1/13/2024,I bought two smart Vizio televisions.  The picture quality and sound were excellent.  I was happy with with my purchases until I wasn't.  The first one lasted from 2016 to 2020 when it stopped functioning abruptly.  I replaced it with another Vizio which lasted until 2021.  I reached out to the company and their best offer was a discount on a new television.  After two failed product within approximately five years I found it difficult to invest in another Vizio television.,2

12/16/2021,Always needs rebooted! When it works it’s great! Doesn’t always come on and you have to factory reset which means you have to complete the setup all over again and sign back in to all your apps! Frustrating!,2
12/14/2022,this tv is nice to watch movies not good for videogames. its kind of laggy.  i would recommend it if you want to eatch movies and have a nice movie time. but for videogames it suckes.,2
12/27/2021,Nice picture but the sound is HORRIBLE! I’m so disappointed that I spent money for a TV with this bad of sound quality. We’ve watched videos and looked up ways to change the settings but it’s still so bad we ended up putting it in a spare bedroom.,2

The first few weeks were fine but after that the tv would freeze up or just turn itself off and couldn't be turned back on until you unplug it for a few seconds. After a few months this happened all the time, like daily and then the left side of the screen got so dark you could barely see it and then just stop working altogether.

8/27/2023,Make sure you test it before 30 days. bought it when it was on sale.  50 days after getting it i installed it to find out the smart function doesn't work.  I had to use a Ruku to use it. Walmart has a 30  day window for returns. I had 3 tech savvy people working on it for over 4 hours and it just wouldn't work Properly. The tv does have a decent picture. Over all not a bad tv for the 400$ mark.,2

I've owned a Samsung for 20 years and it has been passed to 2 other people and it still works. Quality is not there with Vizio.

7/22/2023,it was great for the first year. It had a few issues but unplugging it from the wall always fixed the problem. Weve had it for 16 months and theres now a horizontal line through the screen. i just wish it lasted longer than it did!,2
7/18/2023,Hard to configure and the platform doesn't allow to get many of my old apps. When it is configured it doesn't save so have to go to settings every time you turn tv back on.,2
8/23/2023,TV says its broadcasting at 2160 on platforms such as you tube but anywhere else it doesn't get above 1080 or even 720. Other TVS I've seen at friends are way better. Tech support blames my Internet speed which is 5g,2

4/29/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought the original set (Model # V655-J09) in September 2022. The original tv was replaced by Vizio because the tv would power off on its own in the middle of a program (for example, in the middle of Sugar Bowl football game).  Vizio replaced the first tv at no cost to me.
The second tv (same model) developed a sound problem (sound became very buzzy, I had to turn the volume up to at least 65 to understand any spoken words. Vizio replaced the second tv with the same model at no cost to me.

6/24/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I regret buying this tv. The operating system was designed by a five-year-old. Nothing simple and straightforward.

One of those...""if this doesn't do it, then try this method, if not this method.""",2
5/14/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The TV is great. good graphics & quality sound. However the homescreen needs a bit of work to make it user friendly. 'App row' is not user friendly and requires a lot of time & patience to 'customize' it,2

You Tube?  You have to use your password to register.  Most apps need registering.  There are channel guides for genres but not for antenna input.
Remote control is simple, and sound is fair.  I don't like this TV, but I will keep it until it quits (which will probably be less than a year.)",2

Vizio's have lost their quality since going to smart tv's Never buy another one. That's after I bought four before this one. Sorry Vizio.,2
5/27/2023,"This is meant to be a WALL TV!   Why - Because  the TV picture screen is grayed, has less contrast and color and looks shady  if you’re standing over it – or viewing the TV screen from the side.   However…  it has a nice picture if you sit level , and a perfect  4K picture if you look up at it.  Beyond that it takes awhile to set up and download updates. TV turns off and on with more updates again and again..  45 minutes later and  it’s on to the next step..  You Can Not adjust the picture quality ,  I was only able to change it from sports ,to  standard , to Vivid and so on.  However I can’t adjust the contrast, brightness , black-light, or sharpness.

The 65” UHD Smart TV is now giving us multiple problems. When it won’t turn on, I followed every step to fix it. The only way to get it to turn on was to pull the power. When it finally starts the Smartcast has to be refigured. Several times we’ve got an error message saying “error downloading Smartcast. Please try again. Thankfully we also have Roku installed and that’s how we watch the channels we like.",2

Not sure if I want to call for service or warranty or not because service calls can be a headache.  There is a high pitched electronic sound that comes from the back of the TV when it is on.  Noticeable enough to hear a cross the room.  Started after a month or so.  Sometimes service calls are a headache.  Also the smartcast software and wifi connections are sketchy.  Picture looks great though and setup was easy with the eArc hdmi to my Vizio soundbar.  I have had a lot of success with Vizio over the years.  Maybe it's just an issue with mine, maybe with the model, but I would not recommend this particular TV after my experience.",2

5/24/2022,Thought we were getting a SMART tv and at least once a week we hbe issues.  We had to cancel streaming from paramount and Hulu because the apps will not fully load and when they do they only partially respond.   We have Multiple tvs that are identical and all have this issue.  We have had these tvs about 5 months and have had to reboot each of them at least three times due to not being responsive. I would look at other options if I had to purchase again.,2

I can't remember the phrase that they use to describe the TV but I just know it's not brand new like the one I bought. I'm glad they're honoring the warranty.

On the plus side the buttons for Netflix, prime video, etc. on the remote are awesome and very handy. Just with it advertised with the v-gaming platform or whatever it’s called i would assume the graphics and gameplay on the tv would be better. Doesn’t keep up with my Xbox one x.",2
1/31/2022,I've had the tv for about 3 weeks and I have nothing but trouble with it. From the setup which frozen up. I had to google what to do to get through the setup. Finally did and since then I have had trouble periodically with the sound going in and out and the picture flickering. I have tried doing what vizio support suggests with nothing resolved. I had the same Vizio tv for years without any problems. I buy this new one and have had nothing but problems. The only good thing about it is the quality of the picture. I would try another brand if I could but can't afford to buy another one.,2
1/17/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] First time purchasing a Vizio tv and to be honest, I'm quite disappointed. The picture is pretty good , not great. The power cord is in awkward spot for wall mounting. I don't like the fact I cannot remove unused apps. But mainly it's the issues with the Bluetooth and not lip syncing, the Bluetooth also drops out at random times. I don't plan on purchasing Vizio brand again. If it wasn't so inconvenient I would return the tv and get something else.",2
10/5/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Good TV except the off gassing smell is almost intolerable.  Keep getting a smell of burning electrical.  Also the default start screen is very disturbing, I had to do a lot of searching to figure out how to force it to start with the last screen selected.  Picture is the same as any TV of this capability and sound is OK, nothing to write home about.  So generally an OK TV for the price.",2
7/14/2022,"I tried Uninstaller, network  all complaints are true. Your update hosed the chromecast.  Flashes, then freeze. You name it I have tried it. Your codec is probably the issue.

Smartcast finally quit failing so much but then after watching TV for 30 minutes you can't use controller to accomplish anything, you have to hard boot the tv to gain access to the functions again. So unless you stay on one channel always this sucks.",2
5/25/2022,"I immediately knew when I hooked my TV up, that it was a bad purchase. Problem was it was bought as a gift for my family, so it sat, hidden in a closet for about 6 weeks. So not able to return. Not happy, but got to live with it. Straight on viewing is ok, but move 5 degrees to the right or left and it fades to a white opaque shadowing. DO NOT BUY!!!

What’s so bad, is I now 2 other Vizio’s and love them. One is about 12 years old and the other is about 6 years old. No issues. Guess, Vizio decided money for stock holders is more important than a quality tv. Knew I should have bought the LG, it looked better in the store, but video content was what I thought the reason was. OH WELL!!!",2

The picture is crisp on all inputs, the settings make sense, and the apps are accessible, but the SmartCast home screen is far too busy. I turn the TV on and I'm bombarded with three rows of content, with ads on top and in the middle and my actual apps and inputs on the bottom. The only options for powering on are to have the TV load the SmartCast screen or to load the last input used, which in my case is a gaming console, and there are no customization options for the SmartCast homescreen besides reordering the preinstalled apps. The remote is also pre-loaded with buttons for apps ...",2

I did Troubleshooting and after approx 2 hrs of fiddling (w/ no mention in manual re: diagnostics at all) the only conclusion I could come up with was ""unplug it, plug it back in"". I now have to do this almost every time I switch inputs. There are literally hundreds of users online w/ the same issues as me so it's not a defect specific to my device. This has not been a good experience. I was told not to include my customer service experience in this review by the Vizio website so I'll skip that, I guess. This device is shoddily made and of low quality. I wish I'd spent more and bought something that works better. It's also made in Vietnam and/or China, not the USA,...",2
12/27/2021,This TV is very hard to set up I can not get the picture to use the whole screen. When I go to the aspect ratio it is set on normal and will not let me change it and when I set it to zoom on nothing seems to happen. No matter what I do I get a 2 inch black boarder on the top and the bottom. If it was not such a pain I would surely take it back but instead I will give it to someone and go buy a Samsung. The picture also seems cloudy and not real clear,2
9/19/2022,"Don’t waste your money. The sound is poor, lacks volume and bass (you must include a soundbar, i would go with sony). The remote control has limited functions (you cannot access YouTube directly). The apps are slow (you cannot see the movies icons in Netflix). Customer support is awful, longest wait time / queue, the agent makes you do the online troubleshooting sequence that you already performed 3 times and as expected the issues were not solved and tells you that he will contact you later….. he will never follow up on your issue. Very very very disappointed.",2

I was led thru the set up guide which was confusing.  I had to do it twice on 2 different days.  One of the major problems was the remote.  Only 14 buttons of which I had no manual to tell me the functions.  It also has 6 presets for Amazon Prime, Netflix, etc of which I do not use.

A set up manual would have been helpful",2

Like: large screen, easy install and wall mount. 
Dislike: picture quality is horrendous and grainy for this amount of money. The speakers rattle inside of the TV, so you can’t turn it up very loud. It’s display inputs (HDMI cable) and streaming services really do not perform well. Bluetooth does not work.",2

That's a pain. Don't like it. Make it right or I'll never buy another VIZIO no matter how cheap it is. The excuse they are giving people for why there's no app store is incredibly lame as well. They know they messed up but are trying to do the ""Oh my, there's so many apps out there. What should a TV maker do?"" How about let the people using the TV decide and download what they want so they can use one remote instead of a device that needs charged and connected to stream video. Lame to the bone.",2

I don't notice any difference from my non 4K 65 inch Vizio which pretty much made the cost of buying the new tv a waste of money.  I expected ro be blown away by improved picture but thus tv definitely doesn't provide a good hi definition experience.,2

Most of the time but not always, there is a 5"" transparent bar going across the bottom of the screen from left to right. The TV was okay for the first 2 days I had it but these problems have escalated as the days go by. I've had it for a week, so not a lot of days. I'll be calling Vizio today for help.

However, the Smartcast Operating System bloats the menu with dozens and dozens of proprientary and partnership apps that seem to slow down performance greatly. Apps that our family has zero intention of ever using. Vizio attempts a 'slight-of-hand' claim that ""everything is managed online"" and this glut of data isn't kept on the TV. But all THAT means is that this slowdown is eminating from the TV drawing down more unneccasary data whenever it's being used, choking at the speed of our internet service. For those of you who don't know this;  such bloatware is how products like pre-installed laptops and this Vizio TV are delivered to the market at scale for rock bottom prices.

Pros: Good quality screen. Brand is known for good. Voice control and phone app for control. Price was convenient for a 50"" tv.

Cons:

1/31/2024,The first day using this TV there was almost immediate screen burn in - the NFL logo after watching a game. It slowly faded but I'm nervous about leaving certain shows or channels with a logo on for too long. With any show or movie that is not 4K the picture is very fuzzy with a lot of the background showing white or lighter than it should be. I'm not super excited about this TV but don't completely hate it.,3
1/24/2024,If you can afford more money get something else! It came with the wrong left and right small base legs  and had to install them backwards which gave poor support and tv leaning forward. I did some adjustments and it's fine but I won't buy a Vizio again.,3
1/23/2024,"I was a huge fan of Vizio tvs. It was the first smart tv I purchased over 10-12 years ago, and the quality if that tv was outstanding!! The picture and sound quality was phenomenal. Unfortunately, I had to replace my origunal vizio because the apps no longer work; they are outdated on the system and can't be upgraded.  Sadly, the picture and sound quality on this new vizio I purchased is very subpar.  I would have probally been better off saving my money and just purchasing a roku device to use on my old vizio, or spent a few more bucks and bouagt a samsung...",3
1/16/2024,"picture is good, but volume is terrible.  I have to keep adjusting it up and down. I will be returning it as soon as the snow permits",3
12/1/2022,"Paid full price and I wouldn’t even buy it at a Black Friday price. Says 4k but didn’t look much different from 1080p. Colors were dull and did not pop. Doesn’t look as smooth as any other 4k TV. As far as function goes It has a clean home screen, works fairly well, but I had issues keeping my Vizio brand soundbar connected for about 6 months until a update was released to fix the issue. TV occasionally would turn itself on and off. The biggest issue I had was that the TV started having horizontal lines run through the screen. Thankfully, with only a week left on the one year warranty I reached out to vizio and they sent me a new replacement TV. After I received it I went ahead and sold the replacement and bought a different brand. I Have h...",3
1/15/2024,"I bought this TV seeing high ratings on Walmart, but the TV has not justified the high rating. I have been using it for more than 8 months, TV is slow to respond, probably its OS is too bloated. You can't install or uninstall an app like Roku/android Tv. I hate the OS Vizio's SmartCast OS, it's bloatware to be said the least.",3
1/3/2024,"First, the remote horrible! No HULU, short cut.  The volume buttons are on the side and the up and down are too close together to discern between the two. The color goes in and out which I also don't like. I have  always loved the speakers on Vizio TV's and this one also has great speakers. The last thing that I don't like is my old Vizio had the Vizio name at the bottom of the screen, and would lite up when you turned it on. This new one does not. In my opinion, this doesn't make Vizio stand out from other TV's. The little blue light at the bottom right is horrible and sad looking. It does nothing for me.",3
1/8/2024,"I have been a fan of Vizio over the years. Bought this one because of price and size. Good color and vibrant screen. However was disapointed with picture quality while watching sports. Any subject with fast motion blurred or pixilated.  This TV only has a 60hz refresh rate. Returned it and got a different Vizio with a 120hz refresh rate and was much more pleased. If you're into sports, spend the extra money for a better version.",3
8/26/2023,"Good tv for the price. Purchased 7/8/23
Before even 2 month of usage… hdmi ports will work or not work when they want. They have a mind of their own…. It was driving me crazy when surround sound would stop and tv volume not work by remote. Have to unplug and restart everything. A pain in the rear. Hopefully the will switch this out for me.",3
10/20/2023,the graphics are ok not so good when watching football or a lot of action. I also feel like the remote is extremely slow you have to click everything twice. hotspot works ok on this tv and the wifi connection is decent. overall its an ok purchase i would shop around a little,3
6/26/2023,"TV is okay for the price, should've went with a different brand, TV doesn't provide the Showtime or MGM  (formerly Epix) app and no way to download new apps of your choosing, sound and speaker quality is pretty terrible. You can hear like a rattle or almost static like sounds if the surround sound is active or volume is up high. On the plus side this TV offers many live TV options so that's great can still catch the regular daily news etc. which is the only reason for the 3rd star",3
10/25/2023,Dislike the tv screen black out. With the amount I spent 10 years should be minimum. Google let me know I wasn’t the first but I never had this problem.,3
11/19/2023,"Pretty ok tv.
Very light 
It’s does act slow at times
There was a time it kept jumping to the home page. Haven’t done it in a while. 
I hate that you can’t download certain apps on here like the Roku tv.",3
2/3/2024,"This tv has a mind of it's own.  Turns off unexpectedly after long hours of watching tv.  When you turn the tv on for the first time in a day, there's no volume.  have to turn off then back on. I do prefer this tv over a Roku tv.",3
2/3/2024,The remote moves very slow I've changed the batteries a few times already. it still moves slow like it has a delay. other than that tv is fine. I would've gave it 5 stars but that remote,3
12/15/2023,"The TV is a great value for what you get - you will need to change the picture mode for NFL games, movies and back to calibrated depending on what you're watching to get the best picture.  I do love all the free tv channels, plus it's easy to work with all my other Airplay and Chromecast devices.  My only complaint is that I wish the picture was higher quality, but for the price I'm happy with it.",3
12/15/2023,"I didn't like the fact that My Vizio was delivered  next door%23  246 and left on the side of my new neighbors house by their moving truck …. It seemed that it was going to take a while to get the driver to return , so the next best thing was to disturb the neighbor and let them know that it was my television… he helped me bring it back to my house…  I'm grateful they didn't try to move it inside with their other belongings.",3
11/29/2023,"the carrier was wrong about where she left the package my wife helped her to take the package from her truck and helped her to bring it to the front door it wasn't left in no bushes and if you look at the picture you see my wife with an orange jacket and black cap, she didn't put in no bushes she lied and just took a picture, she was wrong to state that and you'll should look at the picture and question her about her deliverance,",3
12/3/2023,maybe it's something I'm doing wrong but I can't hook up my Blu-ray player to this thing and have the audio work at all. I tried different HDMI ports different Blu-ray players nothing seems to work. they are older but I didn't have a problem with my LG TV playing my Blu-rays with sound so I don't know. other than that it is pretty decent TV for 400 bucks.,3
7/16/2021,Color is so so.  Not the best TV but definitely one of the least expensive.,3
1/11/2024,I have been putting the feet on and off since tuesday it is now thursday and I still can't get the tv to stand up.  The screws don't tighten into the set enough.  The tv wants to bend forward which would make it fall,3
1/3/2024,I have to say the tv itself was nice and a safe delivery but kind of disappointed to find out it doesn’t work with my cable provider too much hassle to return so I’m stuck with a new tv but can’t enjoy my shows unless I pay an extra bill to stream,3
8/8/2023,"Its pretty good for the price. HOWEVER, there are preloaded apps so if you have DirecTV , this is not the TV for you. Unless you connect it to a streaming device.",3

7/17/2023,"We Loved our Vizo 70"" Tv but after a year and a half we began to get thick dark lines on both sides of the TV. We contacted Vizo customer service and they were Amazing. I took a couple of pictures and sent them to CS online and they had a brand new tv on its way and a team of two people delivered it, set it up and took the old tv. But just like the first one, shortly after 2 years this one had the lines as well so sadly we've never got another one again. At my work in out breakroom we have 2 55 inch vizo's and both did the same thing.",3

Game playing using xbox also the same; colors are good, but NO black definition.",3
10/8/2023,"I don't care for the Vizio Smart interface. There are streaming apps I subscribe to that are not available through their built in software. I had to attach a ROKU device to the TV, which defeats the purpose of a smart TV. I could have gotten a TV without smart abilities, gotten a 4K Roku for less $.",3
9/21/2023,"Honestly I should've seen this coming. I bought a vizio tv before and it died on me after 8 years. I thought id get another vizio tv since i was familiar with it. The tv i bought physically is fine but the picture quality is kind of poor for the year 2023. 4k resolution doesn't look all that, the older tv from 8 years had better picture quality. This tv was on the cheaper end at almost $400 for a 65” tv so i thought i was getting a bargain. But now i quickly realized i got what i paid for",3
8/4/2023,TV has a good picture although the stand(legs) are a little wobbly.. it would be better in a wall mount… also considering getting a sound bar since the volume isn’t that great… overall satisfied bc the price point was what I was looking for with an extra TV…,3
10/8/2023,"It did not let you add apps that are not stored on the tv already, example Cowboy Channel. So, we returned it. I called Vizio and they said I would have to hook a Roku box or Fire Stick up to the tv. Well, that defeats the whole purpose of a smart tv.",3
7/17/2023,"Product is fine!  Delivery of product a whole other story.  A 50’ TV in very visible box, was left on my front walk not even up on front porch for everyone to see and take.  

I was out picking up a prescription for my sick mother trying to make sure I would be home for delivery.  The messages advising me timeframe, almost there with order and delivery all came in after the tv was delivered.  

Anyway one could have taken it.",3
9/5/2023,"I received a V655-J04 not a J09 I'm sure that this model is missing a couple features. Unfortunately I didn't realize till I got rid of the box. They won't let me exchange or return it without the box. Picture is okay.. We thought our other TV (Panasonic P65VT30) stopped working so we bought what we though would be the best TV we could afford at the time. Unfortunately it was the Nakamichi soundbar needing a repair. We didn't even need a new TV and now we can't return it. 

Colors are pretty accurate on the Vizio, however dark scenes are rough, have to turn the brightness down to 35 or they almost appear to have a reflection. Im debating on turning off Dolby Vision as it makes the screen very dim so the colors appear as though they are brig...",3
10/22/2023,Item was left flat in the middle of the cement breezeway at my apartment building. I specifically requested that the delivery person knock on my door as I stayed home. They did not. But the it could have been propped up against the wall next to my door. Very poor delivery.,3
8/13/2023,"The TV is an entry-level option. This does not have many great features, nor does it boast a decent processor to handle faster motion well such as sports and action. The TV I purchased had weird tints on the edge of the screen. i took it back because i felt myself staring at all the weird tinted spots. Lastly, the WATCH TV app that Vizio forces you to see when you switch inputs to antenna is awful. Nice to have free tv, but i dont like being forced something that i simply don't want. Plenty of other bettwr options out there.",3
8/19/2023,"Pro: Great TV! Con: TV came with one TV leg. Went to retailer where I bought the TV and went to the electronics counter to inquire about a replacement TV leg. One employee was too busy on his phone and took about five minutes to acknowledge me. Once he did and I told him my TV came with only one leg, he shrugged and said they have TV accessories over there and went back to looking at his phone. They didn't have what I needed. Reached out to Vizio and they quickly sent over the replacement leg with no screws. Reached again to Vizio and was told I needed to have requested a screw to come with the TV stand. They told me I probably would be faster to purchase the screw myself.",3
9/10/2023,"An okay tv for the price. Failry easy to set up but it stalled once and I had to start over. Got only the quick start guide with no manual to read. Remote control a little challenging to figure out but think it's okay now. I do NOT like the stand. It's very cheap and flimsy for a piece of electronics, just two little plastic bits that do not seem sturdy enough. Fear the tv will fall over next time we have a little tremor.",3
9/20/2023,The TV works great. The Video is Great unfortunately the sound is not that great. Listening to live TV the voices are muffled. I've tried adjusting the sound controls to no avail. I'm going to try a sound bar and see if that helps. If not I'll return the TV.,3
2/9/2024,i dont have internet so i cant google for help.   THERE WERE NO INSTRUCTIONS. Not for the TV or to understand the remote.   we'll see on tv quality,3
11/26/2023,So many adds makes this tv slow and compared to my previous tcl tv this one is not 100 percent compatible with my Xbox series x and this Vizio is newer and more expensive than my tcl smh.,3

Very frustrating tv",3

12/6/2023,"Remote control “ok” button does not work. In order to make the tv change channels or do anything that could be done by pressing the “ok” button I have to use the voice control. 
Asked if I could replace the remote was told to contact Vizio.",3

11/16/2023,Have not been able to get tv to connect to internet!  Certainly not plug and play.  Ladies voice that is on the tv about sends me over the roof.  I don’t need her to tell me I’ve powered off tv.  Lol,3
11/6/2023,Lots of led bleeding from the get go. It has a lag. The quality is not awesome. My last vizio is still going after 15 or so years so the brand is good (still I hope). This is just what you get for a budget option,3
12/19/2023,"Good resolution. There are no on TV switches and the remote occasionally locks up. Requiring the t v to be Unplugged to reset.
It asks for your zip code for programming But I am unable to Enter it. Many probrandon choices don't seem to do anything.",3

12/21/2023,Nothing special about this TV. Riced almost too high for what you get. Picture is not very clear and color is off but we've learned to live with it. You get what you pay for. Spend the extra for better quality.,3
1/4/2024,I don't know how to rate this cause I have an old Vizio about 15 years old and still working. And this one I have only had this for about 6 months and I am getting a replacement from the factory. Glad the factory offers a warranty. Worked amazing until it didn't. Got vertical lines going down the screen no matter what I did to try to remedy it.,3
9/29/2023,programming and Remote. too many steps to change the channel.    100% not a easy remote.  going back to Samsung,3

I will connect it to Cat 6 cable today and hope the quality is better",3

8/13/2023,"Although it’s light weight for its size, the picture isn’t as good as my 10 year old plasma.  Also, you will definitely need a sound bar as the audio is on the tinny side.",3

8/8/2023,the tv is working okay the remote sometimes does it’s own thing. The tv cut off once and i googled how to reset it and it worked.  the picture is good and for the price I am satisfied.,3
9/27/2023,"I know the TV was very inexpensive and I was afraid I'd get what I paid for, lol I did. The picture is OK but not what I was hoping for. I'm old enough to know better than to go for the cheapest. Thanks for checking in.",3

9/11/2023,I measured this TV when I got home and set it up because it looked like it was smaller than the last one I had. I was correct this TV shows on the box 43 inch TV but it measured at 38 1/2 inches.,3
10/15/2023,The color and sound are good. But I just got this TV and I'm already having problems with network connectivity and it's freezing up. Not only that but the Remote barely functions.,3
9/11/2023,The tv is ok I do have trouble with it not connecting to the internet a lot. The modem is right next to it so it’s no reason it should not be connecting,3
8/10/2023,do not like the fact that I cannot have Wi-Fi and locals channels available at the same time. if I turn on Wi-Fi accessibility I cannot access my local channels.,3
7/7/2023,"Don't leave your show paused for too long. It leaves and imprint burn. eventually, it fades. All of my other Vizio tv's came with perfect picture settings. This one has to be adjusted over and over until you get the settings right.",3
10/10/2023,It’s not as friendly as a Roku enabled TV but  it works and the original Vizio sound is not the same. The sound system is worse. I was a die hard Vizio fan but this TV downer live up to the past.,3
9/11/2023,It has lines going through it and will have to return for the 2nd time . both tv's had lines going through it must be a defect with this particular model because I own all Vizio tv's and I love them. Very disappointed with this one,3
3/20/2023,The TV has a good picture. The remotes Vizio supplies are junk. seems to be a decent tv for the price. but if you are looking to add apps which don't come with Vizio look elsewhere. They could have done much better at leaving people add Apps that aren't available.,3
6/10/2023,"Smartcast system is junk. Slow, non responsive, and lacks many apps notably espn and mlb tv. The tv does have a chromecast onboard so you can chromecast some of the lacking apps but that is not always a good way to go. If you buy this TV, get a Roku stick or express that is 4K capable and use that in one of the HDMI inputs. Roku system is far superior and has more apps.",3
5/1/2023,You have to have a really good antenna to get a good enough signal for free channels. If you don’t you won’t get a lot of FREE CHANNELS. You will need to sign up for Netflix %26 Hulu and Disney which all will send you a bill or just take the money out of your bank account.,3
5/29/2023,"The TV has great sound, after messing around in the sound settings. The picture is ok quality. we have noticed, on the first day of use, around the edges in some places the screen is lighter than the rest of the picture.  Vizio uses screencast as their homescreen and it is absolute garbage. it freezes. the apps wont load. the shows will lag and freeze. we are instead just using the firestick for our streaming services. i wouldnt buy again and i woulsnt recommend.",3

2/10/2024,You have to turn it up to 45-50 to hear it,3
12/29/2022,"I like the screen size, the sound and it's fairly lightweight. I think the picture quality is at best, good.  The picture screen is not very sharp and the color is on the duller side even in the vivid setting. It also has an on screen channel selector when using the rabbit ears, no numbers on the controller pad, no issue if using with cable provider. All and all I'm somewhat satisfied given the price point, but a little disappointed with this VISIO model as I've always had great picture quality with previous VISIO models.",3
10/19/2021,"Had TV for a few days and remote is already acting up.  TV has no channel guide. Remote has no number buttons to go directly to channels.  Picture

9/30/2023,its great except for the speakers being on the bottom of the tv ... had to buy a sound board so sound woulndt be muffled,3
9/25/2023,"Buy a 55"" TV then have to buy batteries for the controller even though the ones included were Duracell Coppertop! Not good!
But, the TV was OK!",3
9/10/2023,I don't like the home page. I don't like the fact that it constantly losses internet connection and just stops my show.,3
9/16/2023,like everything but nobody told me u have to have a roku to use spectrum i an old someone should have told me about this,3
8/3/2023,I did not like the fact the antennae would not work hooked to the tv and the sound bar will not work with it,3
7/6/2023,"Disappointed in the picture sharpness. I expected better. Simple to set up, but no HDMI cable included. No Picture-in-Picture.",3
7/6/2023,Nice tv but three days after installation a cluster of dead pixles showed up with a line across the bottom of the screen. Pretty disappointing.,3
10/19/2023,TV was delivered fine but the screws to attach the legs and the power cord were missing. I found a box cutter in the TV box as well.,3
8/8/2023,"Product is nice and graphics are beautiful, but should I really have to turn the volume up to 80 just to hear it?",3
7/6/2023,TV is a decent size picture quality is ok and sound is ok but not the greatest. I am satisfied with my purchase for the amount of money I paid.,3
9/2/2023,"it's a great tv but sound is not so good. As long as it's used with a surround sound system, it's perfect.",3
9/24/2023,Picture isn't all that great. The programming keeps locking up and you have to break the electrical connection and reset to get it to work..,3
6/17/2023,I'm replacing the same Vizio tv due to lines %26 going across. I really love this tv ! however I forgot to get the warranty when I purchased it .. is it too late … I just purchased it but haven't picked it up yet ! Thinking bout canceling my order,3
5/23/2023,"I like it being a smart tv. I don't like the remote because it doesn't have the right buttons to watch a movie. You can't pause, FF or REW. 
My picture is pretty clear. I do like that",3
5/23/2023,I like the tv . But I had my order canceled because I couldn’t get it delivered to for what ever reason . Had to wait over a week past delivery date just for the order to get canceled and I had to go buy it at a store .,3
6/18/2023,Mine died right away. I’ve had three Vizios both of the others are still alive after 13 years..  this one didn’t.  Not sure what’s changed.  I’ll have to consider something else again!,3
5/24/2023,"First time trying a Vizio tv and it’s not that great , very slow when navigating the apps and sometimes takes up to a minute to boot up. Got the the tv on sale so decent for the price",3
3/2/2023,"It was packed well and has a very nice picture. However, none of my bluetooth headphones or ear buds were able to pair with the televisions capabilities, as the presales description said it would.",3
11/22/2023,google issues w the vizo watchfree which has no way to disable before you buy it.,3
12/22/2023,I started hearing two voices on the TV and then the volume went out  tonight December 22 2023,3
11/18/2023,The Vizio tv wouldn't let us download our spectrum app for our cable!,3
10/24/2023,After measuring TV at home TV does not measure at 65 inch,3

11/2/2023,Television makes buzzing sound when powered up.,3
11/24/2023,It's not a bad TV but I kinda regret buying this one instead of the onn one.,3
10/28/2023,Nice picture but the TV shuts of to reset on its own very often. It gets frustrating.,3
12/6/2023,It cuts in and out from time to time I've had it about 6 months,3
11/27/2023,We had to purchase a sound bar for this tv. The sound isn't good.,3
11/4/2023,"too big  i need the 55 in Vizio,",3
10/28/2023,I love Vizio tvs but this new one glitches every few days and i have to unplug and reset it,3
12/15/2023,Picture quality is not great,3
12/9/2023,Picture is a little dull. Adjusted color and still it seems not as bright.,3
12/2/2023,The picture and color are okay. Not as good as my Samsung tv.,3
10/12/2023,It is difficult switching back between channels or from the apps we use.  Had i known it was like this i would have looked at another tv.  The picture is clear and sharp.  Music sounds great.  Movies look great. So 3 🌟 stars.,3
5/22/2023,"This TV is generally OK. I’ve had several issues in the short time that I’ve had it. Couple of months. First issue is that it blinks out. Every so often the screen goes black and you can hear what’s being said but no picture. Comes back very quickly though. Second issue is the TV will seem to get unresponsive and you have to unplug it and then plug it back in to make it work. So yes, generally OK but issues that I think a new TV shouldn’t have.",3
4/18/2023,Picture quality isn't as sharp and clear as I am used to. The controls seem to have little effect on adjustments. Also had to call tech support on set up. Total lack of instructions and operating manuals --Would not buy another and I don't recommend it,3
2/9/2023,"Buyers with Direct TV beware!!! Bought this for a family member who still has satellite tv! After turning off the TV it loses audio on Direct Tv?!?! After much time on the phone troubleshooting and resetting everything I am told Vizio has comparability issues with Direct TV! As much as I hate to, I am going to have to return the TV and find one that works and is compatible!!",3
4/20/2023,Did not realize that it wasn't new and was refurbished. Did not recognize my existing sound bar.,3
8/17/2023,DIFFICULT TO SETUP WITHOUT A MANUAL;OTHERWISE GOOD PICTURE AND AFFORDABLE.,3
8/31/2023,I've not had a chance to setup the TV yet.,3
7/17/2023,because I had to pick it up myself,3
9/21/2023,bad sound picture was good but sound need to bump between 50 to 70 volume to hear better,3
9/21/2023,Had a black spot on when got out of box,3
7/8/2023,I wish I would have known it doesn't support 120hz and smartcast still lags,3
7/20/2023,"Alright, does not support Philo. Sad sad day.",3
8/16/2023,Not very user friendly even with my 19 yo son helping. Not enough apps to download,3
8/7/2023,It’s was a really good price for a basic TV.,3
10/16/2023,"Pixel is very good, very bright (too bright) , app is slow 
Good price",3
9/30/2023,Great tv just wrong size.,3
9/7/2023,Purchased 65 inch Vizio  TV and did not receive a user manual for the tv.,3
9/28/2023,Great TV... Took over 2 weeks to arrive...,3
10/17/2023,There are many negatives to this television. I guess I'm just used to a Roku.,3
8/28/2023,hard to download apps. smaller in person wouldnt buy again,3
7/28/2023,Doesn't support Spectrum app. Would liked to have known before purchase.,3
10/17/2023,Ask for a new item. First TV was a returned tv that was damaged and it came with no power cord.,3
8/29/2023,It to slow and it freeze up,3
6/26/2023,It was difficult to set it up straight!  Still leans precariously,3
10/4/2023,The TV did not come with an antenna. More informative should be given at purchase,3
8/21/2023,Smart Cast on these Vizio TV's have to be reset too often. I'm not enjoying this at all.,3
10/21/2023,I liked how big it was and quality but I couldn't download apps that I wanted so I returned it.,3
9/10/2023,"The remote for this TV is very complicated, and i'm almost ready to return the whole thing!",3
10/5/2023,Not great quality %26 the volume is ridiculous! Turn up to 70 sometimes just to hear it!!,3
6/30/2023,"kinda slow at times,grate color is not very loud.",3
7/17/2023,The picture quality wasn't great. Not at all what I expected from Vizo smart tv.,3
9/2/2023,I didn’t realize it wasn’t ROKU,3
10/19/2023,Do not like the voice control. Does  not work all the time,3
8/16/2023,"It was omitting a odor, so I returned it",3
8/8/2023,the picture is really not that great :(  i was expecting much better i am disappointed,3
9/17/2023,It’s an ok TV. Sound could be better. Definitely needs a sound bar to go with it,3
8/13/2023,buffer control keeps going off. have to turn sound up to 50  to hear well,3
9/2/2023,"Nice Tv but. 
I am keeping two stars because the Tv doesn't keep my favorite Apps in my main vue",3
8/26/2023,At times the picture becomes blurry,3
9/22/2023,Didn’t work well I returned it. It kept lagging,3
9/10/2023,"Its ok, decent picture, price-nothing special.",3
10/14/2023,could not add extra streaming channels other than the ones pre-installed.,3
9/11/2023,its a nice tv but only has netfix built in nothing else!!???,3
9/5/2023,"Picture quality is fair
Fast moving scenes (sports) are blurred",3
5/19/2023,"The TV works great, BUT THE UNOPENED BOX HAD NO FEET OR SCREWS FOR FEET. It took 2 weeks to get them in the mail!!",3
4/10/2023,My sound keeps going up and down on its own? I will have the remote in my hand and watch it do this?,3
6/15/2023,My streaming App is not able to be downloaded on Vizio. This Vizio is not compatible for Direct streaming. Very disappointed,3
5/1/2023,"Some difficulties with features. the volume doesn't always work and freezes a lot, and I have good connectivity.",3
4/16/2022,"The pixels are good but it doesn't give a fully clear look but overall image is great.  The sound is extremely low. It's horrible. I have to turn the volume all the way to 90 to hear it okay. 

My Hisense is way louder than this at volume 23.",3
5/5/2023,"Pickup was easy enough but had to return one of the TVs (no fault of Walmart). When I returned the TV, I couldn’t get the 5 year warranty, so now I have a TV with a 5 year and another with a 4 year warranty. The employees need some training.",3
12/14/2021,We purchased a 70 inch VIZO TV and it was a great tv for the first couple of years but then it developed wide dark lines on each side of the tv that became very noticeable on certain shows. We contacted Vizo and the customer service was amazing and sent us a new tv in no time. A crew came in and unboxed the new tv and set it all up and boxed and removed the old tv but within the next two years the dark lines on the new tv started showing up again.,3
5/27/2022,"It does have good picture quality, so if its an Indie B movie filmed sound and picture quality you will see and hear everything. For the price it's okay, I'm a bit peeved that it's listed as a smart tv.....how is it a smart tv with no Bluetooth connection?",3
11/19/2022,"I love how big this tv is and the picture is beautiful.   However a huge negative is the streaming app software.  The basics like hulu, netflix, hbo are available but alot of others such as espn, various cable channel apps, nfl are not available.  You can airplay them from your phone from to the tv but that barely works.  Even the basic apps glitch alot and theres no system restart option. I have to actually unplug the tv to get the glitches to stop.  So im just buying a roku.  The roku should make this more bearable.  Still really enjoy the tv but the streaming software is very weak.",3
8/23/2021,"I have had this TV for less than 2 weeks and there have already been issues with the sound.  One day the sound was out of sync. The person on the TV lips were still moving after the sound stopped. Today, I there was no sound coming from HDMI. I had to search all over the Internet before resetting the whole television. The Vizio website was zero help. The feet that the TV comes with are flimsy and the TV doesn't seem steady. I should have spent the extra money for a Samsung.",3
9/1/2021,"When I unboxed this television there was such a strong chemical smell that I almost lost my lunch. Here we are a few days later and while it's far less noticeable, the tv still smells terrible.

also, this set only displays at 30hz when the standard is currently 60hz. So even if it is 4K, motion is not as fluid reducing the overall quality of the image.",3
1/14/2023,If you're going to mount it on the wall make sure you plug in the power cord first! The location of the power cord makes it so difficult to plug in once it's in the wall. I expected the picture quality to be a lot better than it is but it's still pretty good. I continue to have audio lip sync issues when I use the Bluetooth.,3
8/17/2022,"Works good, except one thing that is difficult these days and a little annoying is the remote control.  Every time I get one of these new televisions it only has a remote with particular company names at the top.  Makes the ones you prefer just a little more difficult to deal with.",3
6/19/2022,5 months after purchase the TV speakers will go up in volume on its own and gets a static sound.  At times the TV has to be rebooted after being off for sometime because the Apps wont load. It does have a over 20 apps to choose from and if you search a show or movie it will give you a lost of the Apps you can view it on.,3
10/25/2022,"Disappointed. Our first tv came in and ended up with a line down the screen with in the first month. We got a replacement tv and this tv the voice command rarely works, apps never work properly until we reboot, not just shut off the tv. We have to reboot about 10 times a week. I know it's not internet or app issues themselves because they work just fine in other devices.",3
9/12/2022,"Resolution for old movies, TV shows on HD plug in antenae very poor. Had to adjust to almost 100 percent brightness even on newer network shows. Sound, not so hot.  Either too bass or too treble, no inbetween.  If only streaming and sound bar use and at the low price, may work for you, or as a guest room TV.",3
9/20/2022,"We purchased this because we had a Vizio that still is going after 15 years. Wanted to upgrade to a smart tv so decided on this one. Very disappointed. It constantly lags, Paramount   won't load, YouTube tv doesn't work well either. It's not our internet connection because we can go back to our smart tv in the bedroom and everything works fine and no lagging.  Loved the set up of the tv and remote but it is going back and we will pick something different.",3
6/30/2022,"sometimes on sling itll buffer every few seconds but be fine on my old tv with roku. sometimes apps dont wanna load but will on my old tv. when i record a movie or show and try to watch it while its still on, it starts to play were it is live instead of the beginning of the recording like my old tv does. my old tv is a vizio 50 inch and i added roku to it. bought the tv in 2015. still works. didnt matter which tv was in the living room where the wifi is strongest. old tv still works better because of the roku i use. might have to buy a roku for this new tv so itll work better even tho it has a ton of apps on it already. good thing about this one it does have alot more apps on it then my old tv from 2015, just assumed it would work like roku",3
12/11/2022,"Bought and renovated a nww howm and purchased 2 Vizio one 50 inch one 55 exactly the same.
The streaming is awful on both TV's.
it stops all the time with browsing issues. i have to back out and restart.
I've contacted Cox wify support and still its an issue.
Since both are new TV's with the same issue im not sure where the problem is. TV or wify.

The color and picture is great.Sound just ok.

I had Vizio before a non Smart tv and i used Roku device and Never had an issue like this constantly browsing and getting stuck.",3
2/18/2023,Well the TV is great. Has a great picture and sound. Walmart really needs to improve on how to contact someone to find out where your product is. It took 3 days from the store which is approximately 5 miles away.  Very disappointed and won't use delivery service again. Would have been 5 stars if it wasn't for the lousy delivery system.,3
7/2/2021,"Overall good (NOT great but not bad), just annoying issues. I still have a few days to determine if we should keep it and deal with the issues (see below).
Pros: 1. Relatively affordable, 2. free channels, 3. all the nice apps built-in, 4. multiple HDMI inputs, 5. Color is good 6.ABILITY TO SCREEN MIRROR/CAST LAPTOP AND SMARTPHONE!!! 
Cons: 1. Renamed cable box HDMI input but it keeps going back to a name I didn't choose - TUNER 1, 2. randomly sound lags behind the image - I had to unplug the TV, wait a minute, and then plug it back in, to resolve the issue. 3. Also frequently turns off my cable box and I have to turn it on again and wait for it to finish booting. I called Vizio Cust Service, we tried working on it and it seemed to have res...",3
3/1/2022,Excellent picture and price but the remote control tv feedback  it's super slow. From turn it on to changing channels it takes about 15 to 30 seconds or longer at times. At first I though it was the remote control that had problems then notice there was a delay from the TV to bring up the picture and even changing channels. I rebooted the TV several times and some times it speed up and other times it didn't. The free channels VIZIO provides even takes longer to come up. I see now why there are reviews of people complaining about the remote control not working. Great price and picture but the TV functionality is not great.,3
8/5/2022,"Basically, a decent TV for the price. It took over an hour and a very long phone call to Vizio for it to download the updates. There was NO instructions on how to operate it. When you turn it on you have to press buttons on the remote to get to the basic TC channels. Overall it's been a pain. Don't know if I would buy it again.",3
12/30/2021,Good price and picture OK. But cannot recommend over other brands at similar price. Audio is often garbled while it is fine on my 15 year old Sony. Several times a week I have to restart because it gets hung up or remote goes crazy and just keeps flipping through options without ability to choose one and get on with it. Maybe other models are good but this one clearly has bugs.,3
1/20/2022,"Easy to buy, delivered this 65"" to my home. USB does not play movies like my previous VIZIO from 2 years ago. Then the system froze while in the via online mode and finally, the HDMI sound stopped working. Returned it and bought the 70"" instead... so far it seems to be a bit smarter.",3
1/14/2022,Picture quality is good but I am highly disappointed that Vizio took it upon themselves 2 dictate app usage. My preferred live streaming app is Slingtv. I am pondering sending the TV back for this reason alone. the live TV apps that are installed keeps freezing when trying to review and I am certain it has nothing to do with my Wi-Fi connection as Sling TV runs smoothly on all other devices in the household. Vizio has always been a trusted brand in my household. Companies fail to realize that they lose consumers when trying to keep up with the Joneses and try to fix something that wasn't broken! My Smart TV is a dumb one!,3
1/20/2023,the tv was nice but there was no sound i had it check by the cable company they sain it was coming from the HDMI SO THEY USE THERE DEVICE AN SOUND CAME OUT SO CALL TO SEND IT BACK FOR A REFUND SO I CAN BUY ANOTHER ONE AS SOON I GAT MY REFUND SO THANK YOU IN ADVANCE,3
4/5/2022,The Vizio is nice... great picture quality and overall a good value. It's light and doesn't strain your arms to wall mount The only issue I have really is that the RCA jacks for audio on the back do. Or emit sound when I plug into a receiver for movies. I've used the same receiver for all other TV's I. My home with no issues.,3
2/4/2024,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've never had issues with Vizio TV's until this one. While the quality is very good, its very disappointing that the support for apps is abysmal. Apps keep crashing on me and rebooting the TV on its own. I'm really disappointed and may steer away from Vizio from now on. Paramount+ crashes, Plex app crashes, and other apps randomly crash.",3
2/10/2024,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] In typical Vizio fashion, big TV with a great picture, but it turns off automatically. Can't figure it out. Enjoying a show and then the TV turns off by itself. The last VIZIO, the picture started going out after a year. Won't be buying another one. Ever.",3
6/22/2023,First off it said it was 53” tv on the box. That was a lie. But I still like the tv either way.,3
5/11/2023,That tv came a day late and had no remote in it smh,3
6/25/2023,I don’t like the remote. It’s too small and complicated.,3
6/20/2023,when i got my tv the screen was busted,3
5/14/2023,"volume isnt good, have to turn up to 60 when shows are on and turn volume down with commercials.",3
6/10/2023,"Had 2 weeks, power shuts off,have to unplug and plug back in to tv, pribably return",3
5/18/2023,"TV turns on by itself.  no idea,why or how to fix it.",3
6/1/2023,not really happy with this tv,3
5/14/2023,volume is pretty bad. doesnt get loud until its on 75.,3
4/27/2023,Ive had this t.v for 2 weeks now and i noticed that the picture is ok and the volume is very low,3
4/26/2023,Not very easy to set up - larger picture means less definition.,3
4/5/2023,The sound is not loud enough,3
12/29/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] TV won’t detect any WiFi signal so it’s been connected using the Ethernet so you would think that it’s guaranteed connection but NO! I can’t access the WatchFree app or the home feature and the only app that works is Amazon Prime and Netflix. All other apps won’t even launch. 
Other then that, I give 5 Stars to the picture quality.",3
12/24/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] i bought this tv to run my metaquest 2 on and it would not work....even after several calls the engineer's could not fix it. now i cant run it on any of my vizio tv's unless i use a mobile phone.  put at least it still works great on a samsung,3
1/3/2024,"My last Vizio tv was great, just didn’t last very long. Picture quality was excellent and no issues with filling the screen. This new Vizio tv’s picture quality is much less and trying to keep the screen filled is not possible. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn’t no matter what settings I employ.",3
1/9/2024,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The tv is great visually. The sound options are minimal and the sound quality is mediocre. There are not a ton of options as far as equalizer goes, the sound options for an outside sound bar is restrictive and the tv sound by itself isn't good enough not to have an outside sound source.",3
1/6/2024,"This TV has a beautiful picture, an easy and simple to navigate menu, and tons of built in apps. The reason I'm docking it two stars is for a flaw in the audio that, according to social media, lots of other Vizio owners have been complaining about. It's almost as if there's some sort of sound gate built into this TV that can't be adjusted or turned off. During quiet scenes in movies, video games or TV, it's almost like the sound momentarily shuts off, and entire words of dialogue are missed. It's an extremely irritating flaw that I've tried countless ""solutions"" I've found online to no avail. It's a shame because again it's got a very nice picture, but it takes you out of a good movie or game when the sound keeps cutting out.",3
12/27/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sure it’s a great product, but cannot figure how it os an improvement. We wanted to replace the HDMI cord we use to stream from our phones. However, without a separate Wi-Fi source this does not seem to be an option. No, we do not have any access to internet except through our phone hotspots. Not willing to pay for that when we already pay for unlimited on our plan. Like I said probably a good product-maybe great, just not enough to make the switch. It will take the HDMI cable, but we already have that. So….",3
4/30/2022,The tv is slow to process commands.  Takes a while for the tv to change outputs.  Tv hqs to be rebooted on occasion to work correctly.,3
8/2/2021,"Buggy software,freezing problems,audio sync Problems, external player problems,chemical smell of plastic used,upscaling problems,reset,reset,reset,not worth the troubles",3
11/24/2021,Tv is nice but don’t expect to get an operators manual because one is not included. They claim they went free. BS. They just shifted the cost to the consumer to be non green and waste their ink printing it off.,3
7/27/2021,"Speakers aren't very clear. A picture could be a little clearer. Couldn't add fobu to the apps
 So I still have to use roku to get what I wanna watch. I was hoping I could add all my apps to smartcast or whatever it's called
.",3
2/9/2022,"The TV is very complicated to use - more complicated than the other SMART TVs in our home.  Purchased it for my mother, who is in assisted living, and have had to replace it with another TV that is not so complex.",3
7/6/2022,"This tv has a good picture but have to reset it a couple of times a week for it to work with my soundbar. Becoming quite annoying bought this in March 2022, planning on putting in my bedroom and getting a less glitchy one for living room",3
2/12/2023,"Love the features and ease of use but the picture quality is not as clear as expected, actually more blurry than should be and not as clear as other brands that are cheaper",3
11/12/2021,"The tv worked great at first, but I started to notice lack of audio and few weeks ago, now when I try to any watch type of movie on any app the screen either green or colorful static.",3
11/11/2021,"The TV not have SLING Streaming, I had to get Roku device to get sling. It is big mistake that sling TV apps not listed and we hope the vendors get VIZIO to update this model data.",3
1/5/2023,"Well first I'm enjoying my TV.  What I didn't like was how my TV was on displayed in front of my house with no covering but the box it came in
 Everyone  that passed by my house knew I had a Vizio 55"" screen for anyone to walk away with. Not good!!",3
5/24/2022,"good price, but i very much dislike this TV. NO AUX 3.5mm jack, only RCA, how is that possible? also their integrated UI too complicated and slow. Remote is hard to use.",3
11/5/2021,"After a week, lost volume completely; and twice screen completely blacked out. After reboot corrected itself. Setup was fairly straight forward, and picture is great.",3
12/12/2022,There is no instruction book with it.  No numbers on the remote some how you are suppose to talk to it to get what you want.  It would be nice f Ikinew how to work the remote.,3
11/3/2022,"the picture is excellent, but the audio is terrible with the built-in cheap speakers. I bought a Vizio sound bar for $99 to go with it and the sound is excellent now.",3
9/29/2021,"If I'd known I wouldn't be able to add apps to this tv, I wouldn't have bought it. Apparently the only way is to cast them from my phone. Give me a break.",3
12/17/2021,"Nice picture, sound is OK, but the most disappointing thing is that you can only use the apps they have pre-loaded, you cannot add others, like a web browser.  I would not buy this again.",3
2/11/2023,Good quality pic and sounds but the “Talk Back” feature is turned off but yet it keeps talking! I also wish there was a way to delete apps from the TV. It's not good if you have small children.,3
3/12/2022,"Good TV but so very basic. It has no guide and the functions for a USB connection is lacking functions like fast forwarding etc. Otherwise, it has many good features along with a nice picture. The sound quality is fine.",3
3/13/2022,THE TV IS SMARTER THAN I'M I CAN NOT GET IT TO GO TO YOUTUBE OR ANYTHING I WAS LUCKY JUST TO GET IT TO JUST WATCH TV AND I'M ON CABLE..SO SMART YES YOU HAVE TO BE.,3
11/23/2021,There was NO remote ! And one of the legs to the tv was sealed in a bag the other leg was in a Great Value  zip lock bag ! Making me think think I was sold a used tv ! The tv box was sealed up !?!?,3
12/10/2021,Bought this tv. it constantly disconnected from the internet and froze up and the picture looked bad. took it back and got the 65 inch version. it is way better.  guess you just gotta take em back till you get a good one.,3
2/23/2022,I wasn't overly thrilled with this tv. I actually ended up refunding it for a different brand. There was no way for me to add my own apps to the tv such as Spotify.,3
7/24/2021,Picture quality is ok remote wo t alway turn tv on huge delay not liking that. Sometimes i have to physically walk over to the wall its mounted on and turn it on by the button. Not very loud either. Looking for a sound bar,3
1/11/2023,At least this one was not a piece of crape like the  first one that was delivered to me and turned out to be a lousy refurbished television that did not work at all.,3
8/30/2021,"This is my 2nd Vizio Tv but first in like 6 years. Took me a good half hour to figure out how to open the battery compartment on the remote!
Audio / Video out of sync when first turned on. Have to shut it off",3
12/3/2021,The picture quality is subpar. I was expecting much better quality. I have owned several tv from this brand and I am very disappointed. It keeps disconnecting my surround sound and the volume is low I have to watch stuff on 30 plus to hear.,3
12/18/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This TV was an open-box discount item at a big box retailer so I jumped at the price. Aside from the great price, I’ve been pleasantly pleased with the functionality. It’s just as good with picture clarity, user-friendliness, and compatibility compared with any other competitive yet significantly more cost effective!",3
12/5/2023,"The picture is OK. I have tried adjusting it with all the provided settings and controls, but I just cannot get the picture to look as nice as my old Sony or my LG. Vizio keeps performing software updates that change the look and locations of the on screen looks and controls, so this is a bit annoying. My biggest disappointment is the sound, which has a high amount of treble and small amount of bass in the all 0 default setting. I set the bass to +3 and the treble to -4 and the sound is reasonable. But if you power off the TV, the next time you turn it on, the sound is again harsh. When you go to the sound settings, the settings still show but the are obviously being ignored by the software.  When you change the setting, you can immediately...",3
11/9/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this TV about a year and half ago and a couple months ago I noticed thin colored lines.  I tried to troubleshoot and nothing worked.  I have another Vizio that is about 20 years old and still works.  I am really disappointed in the quality of this new TV.,3
10/30/2023,I bought a 50 inch tv three years ago. Well it had a defective screen. I'm hoping by now Vizio has made their screens better. Because I'm sure they have received massive backlash over the defective screens. At one point there was a class action lawsuit out against them. The thing that's nice about Vizio's in general. They still have AV inputs which is great for classic gaming. But also three hdmi inputs for modern games,3
12/12/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Price was right but as always you pay for what you get. For my rating it is what it is because i have a cable provider that their app isn't available though Vizio but is available on other tvs in my house.,3
11/23/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I like a lot of things about this TV, but it frequently is slow to find the internet connection on startup and drops it regularly while I'm watching TV. The signal to the TV is strong and other devices near it have no problem..",3
11/27/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I don't need another layer of options before my home screen.  You should minimize my clicks to get where I want to go.  Recently used apps should be prominently displayed.  It takes a long time relatively to navigate between apps.  Should be a 'back' button on the remote with instant return.,3
11/23/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] the TV worked great when I first bought it but every time Vizio decides to update it it gets so slow that it is barely usable. have dealt with support and they get it fixed just in time for another update that messes it up again.,3
11/19/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It is definitely worth the price you pay for this TV! The quality of picture is amazing but the sound on the in Tv speakers is pretty bad. After a few years it starts to lag when opening. Overall it’s an good tv for the price and I would recommend it to anyone:),3
12/5/2023,"Bought the. 50”, very nice picture. I chose my favorite streaming channels but it doesn't line up on screen. I have to go into another channel only to find all my prior channels viewed. I could not fund NHK World and Roku streaming stations that I watch daily. The TV picture is beautiful but put my 43” back in family room.",3
10/21/2022,"I dislike the fact that when u purchase a 50"" TV and get it home, take it out of the box, break out ya measuring tape to check the size and it's only a 43"" TV in all actuality!",3
8/10/2021,"It doesnt have an internet browser  and it
Doesnt have Philo",3
1/9/2024,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The quality of the image is low, the colors are not depth, the bright is poor. Definitely it is not a 4K screen",3
1/22/2024,"There is no ethernet cable hook up on the TV, which is one of the reasons why I bought it so now I have to do it through wireless when I get a lot better speed by just hooking it up through the wires",3
1/21/2024,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Picture is ok I don't like the limited pre installed apps would like an app store to download apps. Also the TV failed 6 months old and is set for repair.,3
1/4/2024,Not huge on the home layout but not a big deal but right out the box tv had no audio once so ever so had to go purchase a sound bar and would like if in the apps it could have Spotify instead of all these other random who knows what apps,3
1/5/2024,Please add Philo to your apps and make it so I can have all my apps in one place so I don’t have to hunt for them! So for now I really prefer Ruko it more stream lined,3
4/9/2023,"TV failed just before a year of purchase. VIZIO attempted a factory reset. which did not fix the issue of intermitent lines appearing across the screen. Went to original store of purchase to get a copy of receipt and they looked up serial number in their system and told us they couldn't print our receipt. Went to a different store and they were not only able to find the receipt, but also purchase date down to the register number whi h indeed was at orig store and printed receipt for us. Thank goodness! Needed to provide copy of Receipt to VIZIO for refund along with pictures of the issue and serial on back of TV.",3
7/16/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this a few years ago and its held up pretty well hasn’t slowed down too bad. The only issue i have with it is it sometimes randomly turns black and has issues with sound and the quality of it. Sometimes the speakers make the sound sound to sharp and it kinda squeals.,3
7/15/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I guess that’s a good thing for me the warranty was for one year, it was working perfect sound/picture but 9 months in and I got weird vertical lines across the screen with no actual picture. Called it in and they couldn’t fix it so a refund is in process now. I’m not sure if I’ll buy Vizio again.",3
8/18/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Does well for a smart TV, though had issues where there were large, stationary black bars across the screen about half of the times I turned the tv on. A system update seems to have fixed it, though. I also noticed that they don't have as many apps as some of their competitors, like crunchyroll for example. It will work for most major streaming platforms, though. Sound and picture are nice.",3
9/24/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Got my TV yesterday and have it mounted on the wall...Have a large room and the 70"" fills the wall nicely and give good viewing angles.
I'm disappointed that not all the features are available in Canada as a matter of fact in order to register, I had to use a fake american zip.  Perhaps you could fix some of these issues.  I'm told I can't even use my credit card on your system.",3
5/15/2022,"The tv itself is fine. Picture is great. However, it keeps dropping wifi even though the router is next to it. Have tried plugging into the router and that works for awhile, but it still drops signal. Considered changing out the router, but nothing else has this issue. Considering returning it and just getting a Roku tv.",3
10/20/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I use the TV on a screened in porch. The picture is fantastic and the features are awesome. The biggest issue that I'm having is the constant buffering. This doesn't make sense because when I'm using a FireStick I dont' have any problems. Same network, same location. I was hoping to use the built in smart abilities but they just don't work as they should.",3
10/3/2023,so this TV is not compatible with Spectrum TV if you have that as a service provider they are not compatible together you'll have to get a Roku stick for your TV in order to watch your cable channels at home just an FYI because I didn't know that before I bought it,3
10/15/2023,I had a curved screen 55 Samsung that had some pixel mirror issues so I thought I would try Vizio 50 Smart tv. The technology leaves alot to be desired. The channel list is good but ... it's guide only covers 1.5 hours of programming and thats it. The picture is great. No very easy to access for inp,3
9/4/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Remote does not fully work. Called support.  They walked me through a fix which did not work.  Was told I would receive a new remote and look for the tracking information.   Well, I'm still looking.  Ne info and no new remote.",3
7/20/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] We've had this TV for about 2 years, and it was working very good. Then, about 2 months ago, horizontal lines started appearing. They're really only noticeable when there's a light colored screen, but they are getting worse.",3
10/16/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] While the features are nice, I have been unable to watch any program without interruption every 5 to 10 minutes; that is w/o the T.V. screen fading to black and VIZIO wording appearing.  The only exception is my ability to watch (w/o interruption) films on Netflix or PrimeVideo. I am currently awaiting a visit from a VIZIO technician.",3
8/17/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The TV does have a food picture. Unfortunately with the placement of the speakers it is hard to hear more than15 feet way. I also have had to do a factory reset because the left side Of the picture wad creeping Howard the center.,3
8/16/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It's not really that great of a TV for it to suppose too be a smart TV it's got so many things that really makes it stressful as in it has to be connected to a network n it doesn't allow you to even be able to access your digital channels without it being connected to a network, N another thing is the remote stops working all yhe time n it makes it hard to be able to do anything on it unless you connect your phone yo the same network which is stressful n it doesn't connect to Bluetooth as it advertising that it does!",3
8/1/2023,I will come back and make another review after I receive my remote power cord and legs for the tv I just bought it was on sale I ask the Walmart associate why it was marked down and he said because it had been opened but assured me they pack them back and check that everything is ok. Well,3
7/9/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It’s very glitchy a lot of the time. It glitches out a lot to be honest and expected it to be better considering how much it cost. It can glitch out when turning it on to be in the middle of watching something to have it randomly turn off. It is great when it works but for as much money as it is you expect it to not glitch out as much.,3
9/2/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The sound quality is terrible The words are muffled  together like there under water.plus you stand to the side the picture fades. I bought my first Vizio 42in in 2011 great sound and picture.it was still playing very well after 12 years.my new 50in tv is terrible. They were much better 12 years ago.,3
5/18/2022,"I honestly can't give a good nor bad review. Before we got the chance to watch it our 3 year old knocked it over and the screen came out, didn't shatter just basically came apart. I can't give you an honest review which is why I stay neutral with a 3",3
7/16/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Basic 4k TV with horrible sound quality! We have to crank most movies and shows to 75 to get full sound, yet commercials will bust your eardrums. Constantly correcting for this. Also, we have an awesome soundbar which this Vizio TV cannot read, so if we want better sound, we are forced to buy a Vizio Version of a sound bar. Disappointed in this purchase.",3
9/6/2023,The tv itself is nice. The remote app is easy to work with no ads but it glitches and the volume gets stuck and keeps turning up or down until you close out the app. Does not work with Alexa as advertised. I would've saved my money and bought a regular one had I known it wasn't completely enabled as a smart device.,3
7/16/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The television will freeze up and there are times that turn it off and on doesn't work at all the volume doesn't work at all sometimes and I have to completely unplug it from the wall and plug it back in to straighten it out,3
9/11/2023,"The shopping experience was great. The employees could not have been more helpful.
However, all three HDMI ports on this TV quit within three days. Now we wait 5 to 7 days for a Vizio service technician to come and repair it. This is very frustrating.",3
7/8/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Got this TV as a gift and it's pretty good...easy to use basic little things on it...the only downside is you can't download any other apps..you have to wait for the updates and apps to be automatically installed...,3
6/27/2022,"It was great that the TV arrived quickly; however, the box had multiple tears in it, which is not great when it is holding a very large TV.",3
9/4/2021,The casting didn’t work and it’s hard to find how do I add my own apps of my choice! The voice remote is nice though.,3
1/25/2024,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Had this tv less than a year and it always seems to freeze and I have to reboot.,3

1/31/2024,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bright picture, nice sound but definitely doesn't have enough family/christian apps",3

6/24/2021,"It got stuck updating when it came out the package. Took having to unplug the tv and re do it multiple times, including turning off the WiFi",3
1/4/2023,Inferior picture quality no matter how you adjust it. You get what you pay for. Spend more get better I returned same day.,3
12/8/2021,The price was great.  The picture quality isnt so good.  Its not as clear as i hoped.  Looks a bit foggy/fuzzy for it being a 4K tv.,3
4/26/2022,Good price!  Good value!  Not really easy for older people to figure out how to use.  Otherwise it’s a good investment.,3
9/14/2022,The picture is okay but literally dims in comparison to other brands I’ve had. The sound quality is really poor.,3
12/1/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Vizio is good in dark room but has a glare in well lit areas. Good picture setting for movies or gaming.,3
12/1/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The picture is great but the sound is very echoey even messing with the setting it is still not that great.,3
10/28/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Well the remote doesn't like to work all the time,so gotta unplug the TV,count to 10 plug back in🤔⁉️ But otherwise it's been a good TV 🙂🙏👍",3

11/14/2023,I havent even picked up the yet. My wife just bought it for pickup on her phone and i go to look at the measurements one more time and the price dropped $100 in 10 minutes.,3
12/1/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Not pleased because I had to purchase a device in order to use my cable provider.  This is something that should be addressed or even told before purchasing a VIZIO TV.,3
11/26/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have had this tv for almost a year. Just recently there was an update on it when I turned it on.  Now I can’t get my guide to come up half the time and my picture quality it terrible,3
1/2/2024,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I had a prior Vizio and no problem but this one? it's OK but definitely not the best,3
12/28/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The biggest drawback is that there is no internet explorer.,3
1/1/2024,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It does not have the spectrum app available so that people can use their cable subscription,3
12/26/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great all around until recently started to have lines across the screen …,3

1/7/2024,Great tv untill my cat killed it. got knocked over twice from a foot and a half drop and the screan is compleatly distroyed.,3
9/29/2022,"Did not come with a users manuel.  Little remote does not have hold, fast forward, or back button.  Since we don't have a users manual, its hard to figure out.  Set up was not as easy as Samsung.",3
9/11/2023,"we bought this TV about 2 yrs. ago.  The volume sound was never really good.  It still is not as good as our other 4 Visios.  Is there a recall on the 65"" Visio?",3
10/1/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought it, but I kept having to unplug and restart the tv (once a week) to work right. I wish there was parental controls for the apps.",3
8/15/2023,"Screen went out and was covered by warranty, just an inconvenience. The replacement tv has issues turning on sometimes screen stays blank and I have to keep turning on and off. Then it reboots but still doesn’t come on. This is a bit frustrating.",3
7/17/2023,Purchased my TV a little over a year ago and right as the warranty was over the screen became discolored and has multiple lines on it. I won't be purchasing a Vizio product ever again.,3
8/4/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Overall the tv is good.  Sound system not very good for a tv of this size.  Also, disappointed that the Spectrum TV app is not available on the App Store.",3

8/24/2023,"This Vizio V series 58” TV’s screen went out (pixelated) after just over one year, evidently a known defect. Aside from that the TV has been fairly decent, aside from load times for streaming services.",3
9/4/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The tv itself is great with the apps. The volume isn’t that great with tv shows/movies. Gaming volume is great though.,3
10/2/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this item about a year and a half ago but the problem over time was that dead pixels developed on the right side of the screen.,3
8/16/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Have had the TV for about a year, about 3 months in, alot of different colored lines are all over the screen. Usually really happy with Vizio but disappointed this time.",3
7/20/2023,After having and enjoying the tv for 16 months now the tv display has glitched and is apparently un-fixable. Contacted Vizio tech support (who were very nice) %26 was told it was out of warranty and the only thing they could do was a refund.,3
6/16/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] We have had TV for about a week now. Getting started was kind of rough. After all the firmware updates it gave an error unable to launch smart cast. This rendered the ""smart features"" non functional. Right out of the box the TV was not functioning as a smart TV as it is advertised and sold. Did a hard power reset and settled that issue. Occasionally the TV will turn itself on. This a little concerning and will have to keep an eye on it. 
  I hope vizio is aware of these issues and working on patches.",3
5/1/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] So I purchased this tv when my old Vizio went out after some years. Now the picture quality is great has lots of apps but no showtime or britbox. Now the sound is basic it is not good . When trying to hear anything you have to turn it to at least 20 just to hear. If its on anything below that good luck. I follwed all the directions on fixing this issues but I was quickly over it. Overall I like Vizio brand just dont like this model,3
3/26/2023,I am pleased with the tv other than the fact that the news channels will only pick up the weather station that is 500 miles away from where I live. You need to fix it where people can put in their location and pull up the local forecast for where they are at. Other than this the tv is great,3
5/27/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] it's a nice HDTV. nothing special. but it does give me problems in that I have to unplug it and press the power button for 15 seconds so the TV can discharge electricity. And I know I have to do this because the TV will freeze. And it happens at very inconvenient times. I would not recommend this TV until this problem gets fixed.,3
6/12/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Has great quality although the airplay logo and lettering still shows when switching back to different apps and trying to watch tv, also cannot download apps yourself, other than that the TV is wonderful.",3
6/23/2023,"Not happy at all with this purchase. You are unable to install any additional apps to it. So whatever comes on the tv, that is what you're stuck with. We have Spectrum tv and this tv doesn't have an option to download this app for us to watch it. The tv is going back. Picture and sound is good but not being able to download apps killed it for us.",3
5/22/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The TV is good. but there is a problem. at least once a month, sometimes more than once a week I will have to unplug my TV from the wall and hold the power button in order to discharge the electricity from it because the TV will not turn on without me doing it. I don't know why this is necessary and it can make it very inconvenient because I have to move furniture and move my TV stand out of the way in order to do it And it can happen at very inconvenient times. IF my Vizio TV did not have this problem then it would be worth the money and I would be pleased with it.",3
2/28/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This tv was a replacement for a set I bought under a year ago. The set I purchased had developed a problem but customer service was on top of it when I notified them and fixed my problem thoroughly, quickly and with ease. Thank you!",3
3/12/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The picture quality is great for the price and really easy setup. My issue is you can't get the ESPN plus app. I have bought a Samsung and LG tvs over the past 5 years and both went out. So I thought I'd try the Visio which if I knew I couldn't get the ESPN plus app I would have not bought this TV. What I find odd is the Disney app is there but not ESPN plus which they are a bundle.,3
5/21/2023,I dislike the fact that these TVs sit in hot trailers all year. I have seen with my own eyes. Wal-Mart parks thier trailers at a facility for holding. I woukd not put the whole blame on Vizio. I have always boughy Vizio. I still have a 55in from 12yrs ago still going strong.,3
4/1/2023,Have had the TV for a month and a half.  Picture quality good - Sound quality good - Remote is a pain. The on button only works if you stand up and walk 6' from the TV - the off button works from any place in the living room (12 x 19 room).  The mute and volume control on my primary service are disabled by you remote and now I have to use 2 remotes to watch your product.  We watch our primary service about 95% of the time.,3
4/8/2023,"I've had it for a couple weeks now and then picture is good but the speakers and sound system is horrible. It has so much feedback that I can't understand what is being said most of the time. I have the cc on so I can read what is being said.l have tried everything to adjust the audio but nothing worked. 
I have ordered a sound bar for it and I hope that will solve the problem.",3
3/30/2023,"1. Picture Quality is good not what you would expect from a HD tv. Could be better

6/26/2022,"Honestly, I’m starting to think I had a higher opinion of Vizio than I should have. Long story short: I don’t think Vizio makes a quality product. The only reason I first purchased one was because my brother in-law and a friend of mine have both owned Vizios for years without issue. I bought a “D-series” 32” Vizio a few months back that was just PLAGUED with issues, and I returned it pretty quickly. 

I purchased this 50” Vizio 4k V-Series thinking it’d be fine, maybe I just bought a budget model. Well… I’m not sure. I still have issues with the Vizio I’ve never even had with a TV before, even dealing with my ex’s onnn. Brand had less issues. The Vizio is constantly freezing up or doesn’t respond, the remote itself doesn’t respond sometimes...",3
11/18/2021,"This tv was delivered to me completely busted and damaged. I am not sure who to fault, Walmart or the shipping company but I left a picture below. I had to return the item to the store and then had to pay an extra $30 just to get the same product since it was no longer in stock. However, my family has several Vizio televisions and we have had minimal issues. I would say the sound quality could be better but overall, a great product.",3

8/29/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased this TV to replace an older Vizio. The biggest reason for the upgrade was to have Bluetooth capability. I couldn't adjust the picture to achieve the clarity of my old Vizio E390i-B0. The latency of the Bluetooth on the new Vizio was quite noticeable.,3
5/31/2022,"While I really like most of what this TV does, the search bar is fairly worthless. I can rarely find what I'm looking for. I usually end up just going to whatever streaming service and hoping to find it there. Our old TV, a Sony, had an easy to use search off of Firestick.",3
7/14/2022,"It’s a nice TV with good picture quality. I can’t speak to the smart features as I don’t need or use them. I just run everything through an Apple TV. When you turn in the TV the picture goes in and out a few times as it tries to sync up the right signal. We paired ours with the Visio sound bar too which the TV did buck up but we notice it frequently fails to display the volume level on screen as you change it and when it does it lags significantly. 

Over all not bad but the software definitely needs improvement. I did make sure it was fully updated so maybe this will improve but manufacturers typically don’t release many updates for products like TVs.",3
3/11/2022,I like the tv the problem is every time watch any movie or tv show the tv automatically restarts or off then back on. I can’t even enjoy my shows or movies with being interrupted. I tried to see if anyone had the same problems and was able to find videos of it. There was steps that supposed to help but non of them worked,3
12/30/2022,"While the picture is good(not great, but good), this tv lacks features that most other brands provide, such as access to the internet. Also, when talking to tech support about a problem with my remote, the person I talked to was not pleasant. Customer service is everything! I will never again buy a Visio tv.",3
7/26/2022,purchased it in march of this year and its only july. ... already have a part that went out and I am currently awaiting a tv repairman to come n replace a part. (who knew that service still existed??)     Other than that I really enjoy all of the platforms to stream from?   I just hope that this weird part being replaced is just a rare occurrence and not a foreshadowing of things to come?  Bought the tv in March and its only July,3
5/31/2022,"This TV has a connection we needed for the older technology. I hope they keep that on future models! We couldn't find other TVs that had it. The picture is great, but when we turn the TV on, the sound may be correct, but the next time we turn it on, the sound is soft. It is soft more than correct. We have to keep switching the volume control. The rest of the TV is great!",3
9/2/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Connection issues. Having to reboot, unplug & factory reset with fingers crossed. Already needs service. Purchased 4 weeks ago.

The picture is beautiful, the audio is great (no need for external speakers, amp) and the functionality/options is awesome.  The sw updates have made it much better too.  The things that have always disappointed and frustrated me are that I have never been able too ""cast"" from my other devices or operate the TV, remotely, using the Visio app.  The slideshow function works but there is a problem with the chromecast.  It was just too much trouble to return it, so I have lived with the problem.  Also,  this TV doesn't have blue tooth; next time, blue tooth will be a must have!  Lastly, I would really like a RC with larger...",3

Additionally, trying to get channel program information when on Broadcast, is hit and miss.",3
12/21/2021,"I bought the 65"" V series about 2 weeks ago. I was excited about the price and features.  However, I am sad to say this tv was very disappointing.  The volume and sound is horrible. Very low and you have to turn the volume up pretty high to get a decent voulme. There seems to be a delay when navigating through the smartcast apps and I still have to use my firestick because some of the premium streaming apps I use are not available, like Showtime. Now let's talk about the picture quality... not impressive at all. I probably should have spent a little bit more and purchased a LG tv or a Samsung. Unfortunately I threw away all of the packaging so returning the tv would be pretty difficult",3
6/28/2021,Very disappointed it did not have bluetooth.  My husband used bluetooth headphones while I am sleeping but couldn't with new TV. So we had to buy an attachment to use them. I used them when I couldn't a certain program but if I use headphones with new tv my husband could not hear because had to mute tv I order to use headphone. Don't like that.,3
5/25/2022,Streaming apps constantly freeze up or just quit the volume in the streaming apps is terrible I practically have to the TV all the way up just to be able to barely hear it sometimes the sound just completely stops working and I have to unplug the tv for for a few minutes to get it to come back on.,3
6/24/2022,"I had to mention this because I bought my tv which is not too bad, the picture quality is really good. The size is perfect, and with a sound bar, it definitely makes the experience much better. Now with the cons, there is a lag every so often when you are switching through the inputs or your typing in something in one of the apps, it's very frustrating. Second, as I mention in the title I had the tv for a week and the megapixels started dying which was mind-blowing. So if you buy this tv make sure you buy a warranty with it! Plus side Vizio does have good customer service, they replaced my tv immediately after showing the proper proof of purchase.",3
6/24/2022,"The picture quality is fine, and I did need precisely this size TV. The remote control is terrible, e.g. lacking an easy way to enter channels, nor does it have a flashback to toggle between a couple of channels. It advertises three HDMI connections, and they are there, BUT are so closely spaced that you'll be very fortunate to actually use two of them.",3
6/3/2022,Bought this tv a week ago and it’s already giving problems. The tv won’t turn without having to do a soft reset almost every time. The sound quality is as expected but I have a sound bar and the picture quality is great. All in all I like the tv when I can actually get it to turn on.,3
5/25/2022,"I bought this TV and a 4K sound system, both Vizio.  From the get-go the sound bar would not work.  Called support several times and each time it would work one time.  Next time I turned the TV on no sound.  I finally got it to work, but I had to figure it out going on weeks of messing with the TV settings.  No help from support.",3
9/12/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Since update last week, need to accept terms every time I sign on and TV has been shutting off on its own or I am needing to unplug and reboot every single time! WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY TELEVISION!!!!!",3
12/21/2021,I bought this model due to the fact I have supported Vizo in past few years.  I found out that the quality that I had grow to love has diminish.  I purchase on Tv and had to return it due to wrong remote and unable to play HDMI.  I got a replacement TV and it is constantly updating every week.,3
12/12/2021,I SEE IT THAT YOU TAKE A CHANCE BUYING AND NOT ABLE TO GET IN STORE   ON ANYTHING YOU BUY BUT THATS WHY IF IT HAS A ISSUE THATS SMALL OR BIG..

1/18/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I got this TV after a very unsatisfactory experience with another, and I'm mostly happy with it. The screen is beautiful, and I love how clear it is. I can use the built in apps enough that I don't need my Roku device as much, I do still need it, because Vizio still does not have apps for Crunchyroll and/ or Hoopla, two apps that are very much needed. Crunchyroll bought Funimation, and all the Funimation content is porting to Crunchyroll and yet the Vizio system still hasn't caught on. And Hoopla is part of the public library system, and it seems Vizio doesn't care to support them. They keep adding apps for far flung genres I have no interest in, or ""recent apps"" and ""show inputs"" which is...",3
9/1/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] First TV I’ve bought in 20 years. The old Panasonic plasma finally gave up the ghost =[. I have a Harmony remote and if the Vizio turns on before the input device it gets stuck until I turn off the tv and turn it back on again. Real pain. Now I have to reprogram the remote so the tv is last to turn on. That’s a defective design. The picture quality out of the box was horrible. Had to bump up the sharpness quite a bit and turn down brightness - that’s a factory setting that should have been better out of the box. Also does not seem to be a way to save these tweaks so I’ll have to reset these if the not so smart tv loses its memory…. Miss my plasma, much better picture quality.",3
8/22/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bough this 2 months ago. I've had issues with it ever since. Vizio customer support is much to difficult to use. NOT user friendly. They've got my money now. Need to be replaced. Manufacture date also showed 2 years old and sold as brand new. They should replace for me.,3
6/28/2022,I got this a little over a week ago for my birthday I’ve always enjoyed Vizio products but I’m not real thrilled about this television I’ve had to factory reset it three times to get it to work with the Visio sound bar I bought for it you think they would go hand-in-hand with no thought but careful how you touch any settings you may end up in the same situation.  When the screen is gray or black it’s kind of an uneven cloudiness across the display not super happy about my first ultra high DEF,3
9/20/2021,"Not sure if all Smart TV's are this unresponsive but this one seems to be the worse. On antenna I can go through channels and it can take several seconds to respond. Sometimes it won't be able to see the channel and you have to change to another, then back. Sometimes I hear the voices but don't see the picture. Again you have to change channels and go back. Then the screen started messing up and had to get a refurbished one to replace it with under warranty. Extended Warranty might be a good idea on this Brand. Maybe I am spoiled with good old analog TV where you hit the remote and the station was there!",3
6/26/2022,Our TV quit working after about 3 months.  We called Vizio and did everything required to test the TV.  They declared it was broken and they would send out a new TV.  They sent out a new TV and everything is great at this point.  Great Customer Service!  I had the same thing happen with Samsung and not the same service (I have not bought a Samsung since).,3
7/28/2022,"I purchased this new 75 inch Vizio immediately after returning a different brand 75 in TV. The comparison was night and day ! I love everything about the Vizio.

6/20/2022,I bought this supposed Android TV thinking I could install apps directly to the TV. That is not possible from what I have found. Casting from a second device is cumbersome and not what we want. I will not buy another VIZIO TV. I'll stick with the brands that don't unnecessarily limit your options.,3
12/21/2021,"This TV has pre-set apps. That’s all you can use. There are no options to download other apps I.E ESPN, Spectrum, etc….. so if your in my shoes your only option to watch sports or local channels would be to buy new subscriptions. BS move VIZIO! BS move. Picture quality is good.",3
9/1/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love Vizio! All our Tv's are Vizio, but our 43' and 55' that are in 2 different rooms keep controlling both TV's so if someone in the living room turns the TV off it'll turn the one off in the bedroom and vice versa! Frustrating",3
2/26/2022,Vizio lacks in some departments. one of the major downsides of Vizio is that not all streaming apps are available on Vizio's interface. so for instance the Starz app since it's not available on their TVs I have the cast from my phone. In order to do that sometimes I have to drain the residual power by unplugging my TV and plugging it back in and then I can go to the casting app on my TV. I would prefer to be able to Simply pair my device with my phone which it's already done and not have to go into the Starz app cast to TV as well as go to the casting option on my TV. I feel like it's a bit much. and like I said sometimes I have to drain the residual power for some reason the casting capabilities go in and out. it took me two days to figure...,3

Won’t work until you unplug and reset. Contacted vizio and they reached out to her and did some troubleshooting. Hopefully it fixes the problems.,3
8/8/2021,I do not like that I cannot download HBO and Discovery+ APPS etc. to the menu. My husband Is not tech savvy and does not want to use the casting feature. We prefer one remote to access everything. That is what we thought we were getting when we purchased the smart tv.,3

However, I live in Arizona, with a west facing wall that my tv is mounted on, and that wall gets about 6 hours of solid Arizona sunshine in the afternoon. So, to put it lightly, it gets warm. Too warm for the Vizio TV. At first I tried all of the trouble shooting tricks that I could find on the internet, but nothing seems to work. I reboot the tv at least 3 times daily, yes, the auto-off is turned off and I even put new batteries in the remote and downloaded all firmware for the remote. Yet, it shuts off randomly.

I bought this tv in October of 2022 and about 3 weeks into owning it apps began to have errors and would stop loading content when they currently working. We would close the app and reopen it and nothing, turn the tv on and off, finally we had to unplug the tv to get it to reset. This has become a daily occurrence. We thought maybe our Wi-Fi was the problem and bought a new router, but the problem still occurs. We love the tv, but this is a problem that is getting really frustrating and we don’t know how to resolve it.",3
7/24/2022,I bought this to replace an older TV that failed. It was easy to set up and picture quality is very good. if it wasn’t my secondary TV I would buy a sound bar for it due to the volume and sound not being the greatest. The reason it gets only three stars is because you cannot download new apps to the television. you have to wait until they do it and your television upgrades itself. Apple airplay does not work either.,3

Cons: Remote gives you a 10 sec either way. It doesn't  FF or Rewind more than that. Wasn't compatible with my LG Blu-ray player. Can't delete apps from the 100's preloaded. Input doesn't give you much time to select options.",3
12/21/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've had this TV for about 15 months. I enjoyed it until I recently noticed about a 2 in stripe along the bottom of the picture that should not be there. In addition, there are 3-4 thin lines in the middle section of the screen on the right side. These imperfections ruin the enjoyment of watching shows and games. Since it is just outside the 1 year warranty period, the fix will be more costly than a new TV. Other than that, the TV is good.",3
12/24/2021,This TV annoys me so much!!! It has to be unplugged just to power it on sometimes. I was watching a show and the screen literally went out!! It comes with apps already installed and you dont have the option to search for different apps. Unless you hack it which makes you vulnerable to being hacked!! The picture is clear but all you have to do to get to it is super annoying!!!,3
6/6/2022,"As far as picture quality, this has a very good picture.
The things I've found, that I wish I had known ahead of buying it, there is no internet browser.....I am unable to find how to add other broadcasting apps......and figuring out how to get to the antenna stations is such a huge hassle.",3
11/23/2021,"This a good 4K tv for streaming shows, movies, sports, etc. 
However, don't be fooled by the advertised gaming engine on this tv. Although games may look good, there is screen blurring with fast moving objects and camera movements. I tried to get rid of this effect but it's impossible.
If you're looking at this tv for gaming specifically, look elsewhere.",3

Additionally,  I have changed the batteries in the remote once every other day since I bought this because the TV shuts off and the remote won't work..  Many times brand new batteries won't  work. I don't know if the remote is defective or if it's the whole system. I'm not very happy with the whole situation.",3
8/12/2021,"I love it however the audio and video aren’t synced. There’s a setting where you can attempt to sync them better but it doesn’t work. Have to reboot the TV every other show/streaming service I switch between almost. Very annoying, apparently it is an update issue but i dont understand why that is a problem considering WiFi is connected always. Oh well, still love the quality of the picture and when sound is synced it’s great!",3
5/24/2022,"I have had this tv now for roughly 90 days, one big issue I have with the tv. The reason I purchased this tv was for use with my karaoke machine, it only works with the red and white sound outs. The tv has to be force rebooted often just to get this to stay functional. After powering off the tv you have to go back into the settings every time to get the sound to start working again. My reviews not all bad as the picture is very good on this tv. Much clearer picture and better color than my much more expensive tv in our family room. I would probably purchase this tv again and would recommend for someone looking for a reasonably priced, good pictured television",3
9/14/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] First time buyer.
I was really excited to add this to our home.
We needed another TV to our bedroom due to one breaking during the move. Heard so many great reviews about Visio.
So, we gave it a try. Picture was amazing! The sound, not so good, unfortunately. I has an annoying vibration to it when being turned up just under halfway. 
Maybe this bad boy was damaged in transit or it is common to occur. Either way, this will be our last Visio. Will be going back to our LG or Samsung.",3
2/12/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] First tv I’ve had with no web browser. We used to watch church service streamed from their website but it is no longer an option to go to their website without a web browser. Tv is set up in the dining room of the nursing home and their WiFi doesn’t allow casting from phone or using AirPlay. Definitely a big disappointment for the residents. Still working on a workaround for this issue.,3
5/30/2022,"I've had this TV for at least 4 months now. The sound is clear, the video is great but there are bugs that drive me absolutely nuts. Occasionally, my tv just stays on a black screen and won't go to the home page unless I manually reboot the system which can take forever and then it's still 50/50 on if it will work. I have re added it to my Google home a multitude of time because after the first few days, it never works through the home anymore. Sometimes I will cast from my phone and it will just play noise and keep a black screen, or just not play it altogether. I also have a small annoyance that does not bother most people I'm sure but the tv has the Funimation app but not Crunchyroll and I can't download it. Funimation was bought out by ...",3
8/18/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I researched a lot, apparently not enough, for a replacement of my TCL that could not get Apple TV. I was so happy to find a nice Vizio at a good price that said it could run Apple TV. We get it all set up last night, adding and signing into our normal apps. Cannot find ESPN. The box the TV came in, ESPN is listed as one of the compatible apps, the app icon is right on the box. Come to find out after some interwebs sleuthing, my new TV will not carry the ESPN app...even though it has Disney and Hulu which you can buy with ESPN as a package? I don't understand this at all and I have an upfront paid yearly sub to ESPN+. I know I can cast it to the TV, but I shouldn't have to. I feel duped! S...",3
9/27/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I enjoy Vizio tv’s. I’ve had a gen one 4k tv for a long time and it finally bit the dust. My new buy was a 50” 4k slightly bigger then the 40”. The only negative thing I have to say about the 50” it does not support 120hz only 60hz. The old tv supported 120hz. I play on a next gen console and I’m not getting the full experience of the system capabilities. But it would Be cool if they would make it standard for all their products. I’m giving it three stars because of not having the 120hz,3
8/6/2022,"Waiting to see how long this set will last.  The last one did not last but 11 months and was replaced under warranty.  The controls and options are great and the Vizio name has a good reputation, but our first 58 inch set did not last.  Hoping it was a fluke and this one will last for a great while.  The exchange process was a breeze, even though it took about two and one half weeks to get the replacement to us.",3
2/18/2022,"I like the size, but other than that I miss my Samsung. Sometimes the audio and visual don’t match up, and the sound often has a vibrating 
noise with it even when it isn’t very loud. I guess for the price it isn’t that bad, but if I knew then what I know now, I would have paid the extra money for the Samsung.",3
6/13/2022,"We bought this a few months ago and have enjoyed it very much! However, after about 4 or 5 months, the sound will intermittently just go away. A Google search revealed that many Vizio owners have had the same problem. We consider it inconvenient to have to reboot (at least a couple times a week) a basically new tv that we only use an hour or two each day.  Never had this problem with any other brand.",3
11/26/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] We've been happy with the picture and sound, but we've encountered two problems we didn't anticipate.  First, apps that we use regularly, MLB and ESPN, are not included and can't be installed.  You have to cast them from your phone to be able to view them.  Also, sound from our cable service does not sync when we use the Vizio sound bar.  The TV has a lip sync adjustment, but its a pain to have to adjust it every time we want to use the sound bar.",3
8/2/2022,"Had it one week and already my degital pcm audio is blacked out so now I can't listen with my wireless headphones and I am hearing impaired.  I have yet to get the voice remote to work.  It keeps saying I need to connect to a network, shows me a check connection icon, and it always says it's connected.  While the picture is good I'm very dissatisfied with the issues mentioned.  This is my second Vizio and the one in the other room has some of the same issues so I'm thinking about taking this one back.",3
6/2/2022,"Picture is the best part. Voice quality is excellent. Needs more Bass. Sound changes between Apps from quiet to extremely loud. Sometimes when I turn it on, the screen is black and it only allows me to use the volume and settings function. Not sure if it's from not exiting YouTube before turning the TV off or if there's a network issue at startup. I can reset the TV or use one of the app buttons to recover.",3
12/12/2022,"I'd been looking for a bedroom tv but everything in 4k was too big. The new 43"" sizes was just right and this Vizio has a lot of features at a reasonable price.  My main reason for only 3 stars is picture quality for non-4k and their apps screen is washed out. Dolby Vision HDR 4k looks decent though.
I've tried tinkering with the picture settings menu but it seems very confusing to me and I although I've improved it some, it still lacks. 
It may just be I haven't hit the right settings but this compared to 2 older Sonys (Bravia HD) in other rooms, the Vizio picture just doesn't compare.",3
8/22/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Maybe it’s just my tv or maybe this is a common thing but the picture is great but the speakers sound pretty bad. No matter the amount adjusting I do to the audio the speakers vibrate and sound bad.,3
1/30/2023,"Great picture terrible sound. I guess all new TV's need  a sound bar, which is stupid. It was very difficult to get the cover off the back of the remote control. But the TV was very easy to set up and all blue tooth was very easy to sinc to my DirecTV and the new sound bar as well.",3
2/2/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Really great looking tv. Setting it up was a pain . It wouldn’t pair with remote then it did but wouldn’t move through set up screens . Took hours to finally get it all set up and all the updates done . Tape that it was is packed with left weird lines on the screen,3
6/4/2022,The tv is basically fantastic. Color etc. Just got my replacement after the one i purchased broke after two months. Took a month to get the new one to me. And the warranty is retroactive to the purchase date. Makes no sense. Never had a tv break after two months. Will this one also. Who knows. I have other models that still work after 10 years,3
9/6/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bought tv cause it had all the streaming apps and lots of good stuff for a reasonable price. The box advertisement showed ESPN available on the tv (main reason I bought tv). When I got the TV set up there was no ESPN app on the tv or anyway to get the app on the tv. Other than that the tv is a great choice and at an affordable price,3
9/21/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] If the TV wouldnt randomly change inputs for no reason at all this would be an awesome TV. And, If Vizio had the Charter/Spectrum app available I would consider buying another when I need one....but, as it is, I won't.",3
6/5/2021,The picture quality is excellent and the Home Screen is great. It only gets 3 stars because it disconnects from my WiFi every time I cut the tv off. It also constantly updates which is annoying. I'm returning it to the store. I do love the TV which is why I'm going to exchange it for the same one. I'm hoping maybe I bought a glitchy one. If the updates and constantly having to connect back to your WIFI doesn't bother you then this is a great TV.,3
2/7/2023,"We’ve had the tv for a few months, it’s got a good picture quality but we have these lines that have started to creep across the screen, we have reached out to the warranty department with the issue but haven’t heard back yet. Hopefully it can be fixed or they will replace the tv. If not for that issues I would have left a 5 star rating and a good review.",3
7/8/2022,"Mine is a refurb & I’d probably not buy anything but new in the future. Had to reboot several times. There is a tiny white ‘spot’ on the creek, which I’m guessing is a pixel. Definitely considering sending it back. Note: Nothing wrong with my internet or network.",3
12/20/2022,"Decent smart tv, decent price. The one negative thing is that I get this this no playback message pretty often, even when switching between different streaming platforms and a good internet connection, I still get the same message. I’ll even try turning off the tv and leaving it off for a minute+ but that doesn’t always work. It’s kinda annoying, so I just give up and go into another room to watch tv tbh. I guess you get what you pay for.",3
10/5/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Picture quality is good. Tv is easy to use. Doesn’t have certain apps that would make me love it more, like marquee network.

1/5/2022,"Love our new larger TV. Works great. Just wish you could download any app to it. Didn't realize this or would have went with another TV. (like a roku TV) Can't return now, so bummed about that. Can't watch SlingTV, now have to decide whether to keep it just for our other TV or cancel.",3
4/21/2022,I like how clear the picture shows with vibrant colors but the sound control is horrible. When watching a movie I had to turn volume level all the way up sometimes volume level were is high as 80dbs to hear the movie. I had to return this tv was not going the way I expected it to go. Sound was  poor.,3

7/13/2021,"Bought this 10 days ago and already broken. Lines behind the screen out of no where.  2 days later more lines on opposite side of TV. Good thing I bought the extended warranty.

12/10/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Less than a month of owning the TV. Had to factory reset it already. When I first set it up, it worked fine. A coue weeks layer it would not connect to internet. Went through all the trouble shooting. The only thing that got it to work was to factory reset it. I will reserve final opinion until I see how often I have to do that. This is the second one of these we purchased. The first one has not had any issues.",3
1/15/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I had my tv for not even a year and one afternoon a red line just appeared all the way down my tv . It was still under warranty so it was replaced but being I’ve had nothing but issue with this tv since I got it I should have known something was going to happen . The tv would randomly lose sound and even color while I would be watching . Also the sound is low and just to hear anything it has to be on 40 .,3
4/6/2022,"Great picture during shows, but in the navigation menu quality is bad and cannot be changed. TV has an odd buzzing sound that eventually comes on after being turned off, and can only be stopped by unplugging the TV. Should have went with a different brand 65""",3
9/8/2021,"Good price for the size. nice picture, easy set up. Not pleased with speakers being placed on the backside, needed to buy a soundbar (Vizio) which improved the sound. Biggest disappointment was no headphone jack and no way to connect one per Vizio support department. Wished I had known that before I purchased it.",3
8/11/2022,"bought this a week or so ago. set up was easy and got it cause i really liked my 32-inch tv. However, the picture on this one is blurry, and color seems off. no matter how much I adjust picture it never really clears up. hope it gets better or may need to look for a different model or brand.",3
6/28/2022,I want to start off by saying that this is my first Vizio TV. I’d connected it to my Alexa once and I moved and now it’s not connecting. I also brought it for the 4K and I can’t tell if it’s 4K or not the picture quality is alright overall not bad for the price.  I guess you get what you paid for.,3
5/31/2022,"Why is there no web browser or app store. The apps you currently limit me too are all paid subscription app. I want the discovery app, but not Discovery+ or any of the + apps. The fact that I can't decide what apps I would like on my own smart tv is kind of ridiculous..

6/28/2022,"I PURCHASED THE 70"" VIZIO TV LESS THAN A MONTH.   FOR THE MOST PART ALL IS GOOD EXCEPT TWO ISSUES.  ONE IS MINOR,  IT IS SLOW TO POPULATE THE SCRENN WHEN I AM TURNING IT ON AND THE SECOND IS MORE MAJOR, THE SOUND IS POOR QUALITY.   I MUST ADJUST THE SOUND UPWARD AND THE VOLUME IS FUTTER UP AND DOWN A LITTLE.  BUT I DO LIKE IT.",3
5/31/2022,"The tv itself functions as it should, and is very simple to use as far as the smart component goes. I just wish that VIZIO had the good sense to allow an option for external app developers and a basic internet browser. Even he dumbest smart devices have that, and it kind of defeats the purpose of it being a ""smart"" device if it doesn't have it, don't you think?",3
5/19/2022,"I thought a smart TV could do anything. But, the apps that are preloaded, are the only apps you can access. I use ESPN+, Spotify etc. NOPE! Can’t load those. Use the tv as a web browser?

12/29/2022,"Rec'd a 43” Vizio V435-J01 for Christmas. Once all hooked up, colors looked very washed out. I spent 2 days adjusting(with instructions from manual). I'm about 75% there as far as colors go. But there are two problems: my menus do not have the Picture Mode Edit feature to Save my changes! Also, the overall picture is not that sharp. I've tried everything the manual suggests and picture quality is still very disappointing. I've had a Vizio 32” for years that I was very happy with so don't know if I should exchange my new TV for another one or just return this one and buy another brand. Has anyone else had this problem with the 43” TV?",3
10/29/2022,"Actually I have to say that I loved my TV, very easy to use but after a year it started to turn off, it didn’t cast, the screen went black and after a few hours the image came back.

2/11/2022,"I bought this TV without looking over any details. First of all it does not have a USB port witch sucks because you can't pause the TV like a roku TV. And right off the bat I encountered these problems: For some reason the sound stops sometimes on  just a few select channels and sometimes on all of them or the picture will be all green or black out, and you must unplug the TV and plug it back in, that resets it and it works just fine. other than that. the TV is wounderful I just hate putting up with having to unplug it once in a while in order to reset the sound or the picture.

The Cons 1 No over the air channel guide, this is a really good feature that this tv does not support. 2 No Bluetooth connectivity for external speakers. 3 Has compatibility issue with Klipsch soundbars, I had to replace a very expensive soundbar because my Klipsh was not supported.",3
8/19/2021,"I love the picture and sound. It functions beautifully. I wish I was able to download the apps that I want though.  Instead I have to use a separate device to basically Chromecast half the apps I use. If I wanted to handle 2 devices as a remote, I would have just hooked up another roku. As limited as roku is, I was able to install all apps I subscribe to for streaming. I'm temtpted to do so still and just use the tv for picture and sound.",3
2/18/2022,I love Vizio TV's but this purchase has been a problem.  I am having network issues and Vizio sent a tech out but instead of replacing the network board he replaced the main board.  So far the issues are still the same. When I use a Roku device the network issues go away.  I am thinking about returning it and getting a replacement to see if that helps.,3
7/8/2022,I currently have Amazon Prime Video which allows access to Paramount+ on my other TVs and devices but not on this TV.  I tried several times to access Paramount+ through Prime Video without success.  I contacted Prime Video and they say that Paramount+ can not be accessed through Prime because Vizio is not compatible with Paramount+.  I am however able to access it if I want to start a brand new subscription through Paramount+ which I find ridiculous as I already have a subscription.  Also it would be my suggestion you might consider a sound bar because if you are sitting in front of the set the volume is hard to hear but if you are behind it the volume is LOUD.,3

It has to be unplugged for a bit to get it going again. The price was great but I am tired of having to do that. I wish I would have invested a bit more for a better quality TV.",3
5/19/2022,I really like the TV the pictures great you know it has very nice colors and all. The one thing I don’t like is the fact that you know the remote doesn’t have any numbers so you have to figure out how to change the channels and if there’s no guide there’s nothing that tells you what is coming on or what is currently playing I don’t care for that.

I got it on Walmart.com and picked up in the store and the exchange process was pretty easy.",3
9/25/2022,Not sure if it’s cause Im used to Roku but I don’t like this tv. I can’t find new apps that aren’t already loaded. I’m not able to even stream with my carrier. I’m sending this back if I can and look for something that has real apps and not these off the wall apps preloaded. If you’re used to having Spectrum just know you can’t add that app. Just not happy with this product. Well I just found out that I can’t return it so I guess I’ll find someone who wants a piece of junk tv. See the apps before you buy and not get stuck with this tv.,3

I had Bose speaker for my old Samsung TV and it was perfect sound. Now connected Bose to Vizio. It ended up not sync even I used Fiber Optic.

12/8/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is a pretty good product.  It takes some getting used to, and some features are less than ideal.  When using HDMI with a PS5, for example, it has to be plugged into port 1... plugging into port 3 and pressing the PS button for some reason causes it to switch to port 1.  Another feature that's decent but annoying at the same time is how the TV handles apps.  I like that I don't need to download specific apps for my TV, but at the same time, I would like apps not currently available on this TV without buying another product or using Apple/Chromecast.  It does get the job done, albeit with these caveats.",3

10/4/2021,"You get what you pay for. It does the job it’s supposed to do. Quality is fine, if you are expecting more buy a more expensive tv. This works fine for a college dorm common area for the kids to share.",3
11/22/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I previously owned a Vizio that I loved. I took this one out of the box and it looked small. I measured it to make sure it was 65"". It appears square instead of rectangular like my last 65"".",3
11/22/2022,Tv was great the first day of purchase however that quickly changed. By the second day the bottom of the screen was blurred and the tv kept opening the watch free app even without touching the remote. Vizio quality has definitely gone down.,3

5/25/2022,It’s nice and I got a great price but I constantly have to restart it and then I have to set up the Wi-Fi over again. A lot of the time the volume will turn up or down on it’s own and I have to turn it off and on again to fix it.,3
8/5/2022,I got it two weeks ago I waited almost 7 week for it in the mail the first one came broken in half the second one the screen was black this one is ok but too many features all at once,3
12/20/2022,This is a great TV as long as you don’t need sound.  The picture looks great. The sound quality is so poor you can’t even understand any dialog. It is tinny and seems to rattle and crackle,3
5/31/2022,This tv doesn’t have an App Store to download the apps you actually want and use. The watch free channels are boring the tv have good quality but thats about it to me,3

5/31/2022,The picture could be clearer. The picture seem to be foggy no matter how I adjust the picture settings.,3
8/21/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Vizio needs to add the ability to download apps that are not already in their library.,3

7/15/2022,I’ve played with the brightness and it’s either too bright or too dark. I can’t get a happy middle on this tv.,3

4/8/2023,"fantastic picture and insanely good price considering the picture and features. not a fan of the video set up and registration process compared to when I set up the one in my master bedroom which is the same TV just an older version from 2 years ago. I like the upgraded remote and think most people with smartphones will love the setup process. I'm just a little old school. quickly set up with my streaming device, though average users can happy use onboard apps from the app store.",4
6/8/2023,"The tv is great, it started out disappointing because some apps were working and some weren't, but all we did was call Vizio and they fixed the problem from their end! Great customer service and it was a quick fix! Loving my new tv so far! Great picture quality!!",4
5/28/2023,Love the Tv. Its 1 wk past 12 mos vizio waranty and i have purple lines all over the screen. Have babied this tv...thankfully i paid for the extra  4yr plan. Filing a claim now. Hoping its an easy process to fix.,4
8/3/2023,"Set up was easy, color on point and lots of apps and free movies but I did not realize it wasn’t a Roku tv but i had an extra one on hand to access my generic cable but it’s a Vizio and my second one which I’ve had since Walmart first sold them and still works great so it’s a keeper!",4
12/29/2023,"for the price during the Black Friday sale I mean I don't really feel like I got off Black Friday deal. That's just me being personally honest, the real Black Friday savings didn't start until a couple days before Christmas. personally, that's just from my observation. At first I ordered a 43 in forgot that I had a 43-in in the living room and wasn't content. so decided to go for a 55-in Samsung but after realizing that I would have to wait nearly a week. I found the 50 in V-Series which for $345 after tax and delivery I mean it is what it is. If I can get three years without any issues I'll be surprised and maybe I'll feel as if it was worth every dollar not saved for Black Friday. with all seriousness, I wanted something within a couple h...",4
8/2/2023,"The tv is ok. Picture quality is fair in my opinion 
My older tv had a better picture. That came w our house. Not sure if the age. But older, heavier, not a smart tv. A Sony. Had very crisp, bright pic. This Vizio could be better. Still a heavy tv, too. Expected it to be lighter.",4
5/23/2021,"Picture is crisp, clear and amazingly vivid. Impressive package of the latest features offered in televisions.
Highly recommend sound bar with this tv any tv over 40-inch needs audio enhancement. We didn't have sound bar but will purchase one for this size. Does have built in features to adjust audio without soundbar, adequate.
Shipping and delivery were satisfactory. Notification for delivery was updated every 6-8 hours prior to delivery. 
TV was packaged extremely well. Front of box had sizable dent in cardboard, yet inside was unaffected.
Paper instructions for hook-up, plug- in were simple and easy to follow. USB ports were well marked. Bonus point: having bright colored, designated sound bar port was a nice feature.
Once TV is tur...",4
8/7/2022,"i like it alot , and from  family experience's they have had VISIO in the past they make a good product the one thing i did not like is that i found out that visio was basically tracking you for advertisement's  with the TV and clipping pixels from prog you watched. they qwere taken to mcourt from what i read. the only other thing is personaly i wish it had more input and out put options on the back  more usb ports and or  a couple of C ports would have been nice  i play guitar and bass so iam actualy useing as a monitior   i watch the free channel and youtube here and ther i dont have cable in my room plus i wish bthe remote was more like a remote  i had to download the remote app to my phone to get more functions. like plugginfg in a exte...",4
1/22/2023,The Tv legs are in a weird spot way far out on each side so the TV did not sit on the table I intended it to. We had to purchase a table top stand and attach the TV to the pole and remove the legs it now swivels and fits perfect in my living room.,4
8/7/2021,"Great picture better than Samsung which my husband always like.  We bought this because our son said Vizio is good.  Only problem is no picturewhen you turn it on, you have to wait a few seconds. Bright picture and sound is excellent.",4
1/12/2024,"Good picture, easy set up.",4
6/21/2023,It looks awesome but for some reason it randomly turns off and the Home Screen doesn’t work sometimes.,4

10/16/2023,Not to bad love the size came from a sharp Roku tv was awesome.,4
9/8/2023,Love this tv. Hope it lasts,4
10/8/2023,the picture is not what i thought it would be. But it's a nice TV,4
7/11/2023,"Both TVs were delivered promptly and in good working order.  Very good value!  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was the prompt of a tip for the delivery driver -- suggested $50 !  To my knowledge, TVs would not be delivered by Instacart and ""Free Delivery"" is expected to be just that.  I removed the tip, but there should be no assumption or pressure to pay a tip to a delivery driver that works for Walmart (or UPS).  The expectation of a tip for performing a job (outside of the service industry where less than minimun wage is typical) is getting out of  hand!",4
12/17/2023,Nice TV,4
10/21/2023,"I hate smart TV's as a general rule, because I can't just turn on the TV and watch SOMETHING. I have to navigate, and therein lies the problem. Why doesn't someone make a TV for those of us who are less tech savvy??🫤",4
7/19/2023,"Works as it should for only 3 weeks old!
I was surprised I could pick it right up!",4
1/26/2024,"so I bought a 75 in Vizio from Walmart to great a year and a half ago got the 3-year extended plan and they don't want it back up nor stand up for their own plan I paid almost $100 for so I just got messed out of $1,000 thanks Walmart you know what the worst part is I went out and spent a little over 1400 and got a 75 and a 70 in my room now after they screwed me around on the 75 that now is useless boat anchor that they won't trade even though there's a freaking warranty",4
2/18/2024,"I enjoy the clarity. However, I bought a smart TV to have easy access to all the streaming channels and there is no Roku. I use roku for my religious channels. also, the start button has to be pressed about 3 times before the tv will come on. Normally I prefer VIZIO to any other TV. Vizio always has a great picture and none of the usual problems you might have with other TV's.",4
2/6/2024,"I like my TV a lot. The color is vivid and for the most part it was very easy to set up. It does need screws for the feet to stand erect. The screws weren't in the box. It wasn't delivered to my door so I had to carry it to my apt from downstairs. However, it did come early which was nice. Overall I'm pleased with the product and service.",4
11/6/2023,Purchased this tv for my elderly mom. Like most smart TV's it was difficult to program for her because you have to download an app to program. Most elderly have no idea what that is. There should be a way to bypass this to just setup the live tv only option.,4
1/4/2024,"I do not like the remote that comes with the tv. It is not user friendly and doesn't have a number pad. So you have to scroll back and forth to get to specific channels. 

The volume is really loud on commercials. No instruction manual was included, so I had to research how to turn on the smart settings so that the volume would automatically adjust.  Howvever, that doesn't work very good and doesn't stay on auto volume adjust.  Be prepared to watch a LOT of ads for Vizio products that are in addition to all other normal tv advertisements.  The most positive thing is that the pictur quality is great.",4
1/2/2024,I like the picture quality and it hooked up easy to wifi with alot of internet options. But after 2 months. I came home from work and turned it on and the picture was all pink. I turned it off again and let it set for a few minutes turned back on and everything was fine. But it has me a little worried. I am like it so far. we shall see.,4
1/13/2024,"This is a surprisingly nice tv for the cost. Picture is crisp and clear. The only thing that was weird is how long it took to turn on. Had to update the software when first turning on the tv and this took over 30 minutes to complete. Other than that, we are satisfied with the tv.",4
1/8/2024,"I've alway been a top name brand shopper. Paying big bucks for the things I want. Always been skeptical about buying off brand, thinking I wouldn't get good sound quality and video. Well man was I wrong!!! The picture is so clear the sound is AWSOME!, especially for the price I paid. I got more than I bargained for.",4
1/9/2024,So I went with this Vizio as I purchased 2 Samsungs and both arrived damaged. I picked this one up so I would've have to deal with the same issue. The packaging was excellent. The TV was very protected. The set up was simple no issues at all. The quality isn't bad so I am pleased with the picture quality. The sound quality impressive as well. The reason I couldn't provide a 5 star rating is because of the remote. I've never had a tv with a remote that doesn't seem to work no matter where I point it. It's very frustrating. It's like the batteries are dying and they are brand new.,4
1/20/2024,I previously had an onn branded tv that started to develop horizontal lines on the screen so I decided it was time to upgrade. So far this Vizio tv is amazing! The speakers sound great and the colors really pop! I never realized how grey and washed out the colors on my old tv was until I got this one! It also looks and sounds even better when I hooked up my Ps5! As of right now the only thing I don't care much for is the ads on the home screen and the remote really needs a dedicated play and pause button. Otherwise im currently very happy with my purchase,4
7/24/2023,"customers should be informed when purchasing a 4K tv that other equipment needs to be compatible in order to use this feature on the tv such as 4k dvd player, 4k hdmi compliant cables, 4k streaming service, etc., otherwise no sense in purchasing for this feature if you cant use it.",4
8/31/2023,"Excellent picture for the price point. It has  awesome features and Apps as well. The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars is that, the volume(speakers) leave more to be desired however, if you add a vizio or your favorite brand sound bar, the movies really does comes to life. I’d definitely recommend even with adding a sound bar (as most people do with any  large TV screen purchases anyway) it’s still a great buy for a budget tv. You won’t be disappointed if you do.",4
10/4/2023,"Overall for this price point a very good television. The picture is very good and the apps work great. Reasons for not giving 5 stars: On ""antenna"" mode the channel number does not appear on the screen and the remote control does not allow you to channel up or down, you have to constantly go to the guide in order to change channels. Also, the apps icon line on the home screen is very small compared to the other lines which seems strange.",4
6/30/2023,It was easy to find what I wanted.  The price was reasonable and it was delivered the next day as promised.  The woman who delivered the TV saw that I was elderly and even ifferred to bring the box inside if I were unable to do so myself.  I was able to do it myself..,4
2/9/2024,"We purchased this for a guest room.  It works well and has a good picture for the price point.  I would add that it doesn't support Directv stream, if that is your tv provider.",4
2/7/2024,"sharp picture and easy to use. Good value for price. Sound is not as clear as it coukd be, but my understanding is these newer tvs need a sound bar, because speakers are l9cated behind the set.",4
2/11/2024,works great but remote select button will not work unless you about break your finger. i asked for support i got the trouble shoot . I just bought a new one it was easier,4
1/26/2024,"Nice looking and has a good picture, but Spectrum had a hard time getting it to stay connected to the Wi-Fi and you have to put the source in every time you cut it on. My older Vizio is not as difficult!",4
1/24/2024,"Like that my tv holds up to the reputation of being a top brand for such a reasonable price. Would prefer a little more contrast in the picture, but overall its impressive.",4
2/11/2024,The tv was really nice but I haven’t had the luck to get the tv speakers either on or they just don’t work it really sucks but lucky my soundbar works on it but if I didn’t have that I’d be outta luck,4
1/31/2024,"Great Tv, wasn’t aware that some apps were not able to download on tv! Still have to use me fire stick for some of the streaming apps. Picture shows really well!",4
12/20/2023,the only thing that I really don't like about it is that it does not have a timer to set that turns the TV on in the morning to function as an alarm clock. usually I would set the timer and turn the volume on the television all the way up so that it would turn on in the morning and wake me up. I'm thinking about actually getting a different TV the next go round in about a month or so and making sure that it has a timer that I can set on it to turn it on.,4
12/12/2023,"It's a great TV with great picture. Although when I'm watching movies on disney  (just this app, I haven't tried any others) sometimes there are fades of colors that blink across the screen. Just a small annoyance. Great sound, good quality. Only had it for a week %26 some change.",4
11/2/2023,Only one thing to complain about that I wasn't looking for when picking out this t.v.. It has legs not a stand. I have small children and can get rowdy. I don't trust the legs. Now everything else is right on point. Easy set up to phone. Easy to navigate for my less technology self. Easy to hook up Hulu. Really is a great t.v..,4
12/8/2023,"Sharp images, good color and right size. Price point was spot on also.
The speakers have a little vibration at 25  on the sound adjustment, but not enough to override the overall experience.Second Vizio, first one twelve years old and still going strong, just wanted a larger screen size.",4
11/3/2023,"This is my first Vizio TV.  My positives: beautiful color and clarity on the TV, easy to use remote control with voice navigation.  My negatives: 1) the free Vizio channels have waaaaaaay too many ads (every 30 seconds seems to be another annoying ad for Kevin's frozen meals).  It's quickly become too painful to watch; 2) there is no internet connectivity capability that I know of; 3) I suggest a soundbar of some sort.",4
11/10/2023,"Great TV, once I got it, it took four days to get it, and then I had to go out 10 o'clock at night to a neighbors house and pick it up because they delivered it to the wrong address and they called me and said hey, we have a TV for you here sitting outside",4
10/10/2023,worked right out of box. beautiful picture and sound. Have been using for only 3 months. No problems so far,4
8/27/2021,"It's still on the box unopened because we're doing a room addition that is not completely done that it will go on; however,  box was very dirty and a few dings",4
5/6/2022,Great  size  for  a  sitting area.  Not too big   with a  great  picture!,4
1/4/2024,Great for the price sound is on the quieter side its good but im a bit hard of hearing so its not loud enough for me but my friends who are not deaf from old age say it’s not bad.,4
1/7/2024,It was very easy to order the TV. The only problem we encountered was that it was not in stock. I was told that it would be delivered on a certain day and then unexpectedly it was delivered while I was not home.,4
8/9/2023,"after owning for a few months, the only real problem that I have with this tv is the sound. it reminds me of the sound quality from the early 90s. 
other than that its a worth the price I paid.",4
1/20/2024,So far I'm enjoying the New Vizio tv. Totally different operating system from Roku. But we are enjoying the difference and learning it. Love the size up from my 65 inch.,4
8/19/2023,so the tv is beautifully done i like that but i used to have direct tv and it will not work with this tv only roku. however this tv is much better on disgn and quality over the vizio for sure .,4
12/28/2023,"There does not seem a way to download the ""Xfinity Stream"" app.  We have to use an old cell phone and a chromecast  device. 

Otherwise good picture and responsive in tuning",4
12/30/2023,"Incredible resolution, and insane channel-selecting speed. 4 stars only because of a small dent on the edges, but being completely honest I have 0 regrets on this tv.",4
12/25/2023,"the picture quality  is great from the front. The picture quality from the side view is faded out when walking into the room.
I am happy with it overall",4
10/4/2023,"Great value for 55"" Smart TV.  Next day delivery by Uber was great.  TV has an excellent picture quality and many features that are really cool.  Initial setup took some time and effort to get right.  I am pleased with the results and would recommend it to friends.",4
7/17/2023,"Set up process was annoying! Tells you to download app to pair etc and the app wouldn't pair with the TV. I brought this because it advertised working with other home gadgets i.e. Alexa, Google home etc. it legit does not work with my Alexa and I'm beyond frustrated. I've tried re-pairing multiple times and still gives trouble. Other than that pretty good picture quality, loud enough that I didn't need sound system /bar.",4
8/12/2023,"Picture is good, but could be a bit sharper. Be sure and think through about how BIG a 70” tv really is! I love being able to see a show clearly from across the room, but now having a hard time finding a cabinet it will fit. Probably should have gone with a 65” and/or bought the cabinet first.",4
6/28/2023,"You can mute the picture instead of the sound by holding the mute button down for a few seconds! EXCELLENT! I love going to sleep to my shows audio without the flashing. Great for tinnitus. Otherwise, a great value for it's features. I can watch local channels right in the guide as well. Picture is lacking somewhat viewed from the side, however there are settings for that too. I purchased a sound bar. You probably should too. I'm very satisfied with this one! Great picture, get a 70 watt or higher sound bar. This TV uses 98 watts.",4
4/7/2023,Good quality TV. Superb picture quality. Great price. However the Smartcast doesn't work so I don't get the full experience. Tried resetting and other troubleshooting steps but to no avail. Other than that this is an excellent TV. Voice remote works great. Sound quality is crisp. All in all its a great bargain.,4
8/8/2023,Installation with an existing wall mount went well. Setup with our wifi was easy. The picture is fabulous and sharp.  This replaces a TV with a fire stick and I have to say that because we had multiple dire sticks it was more labor intensive to set up all the apps than just setting them up on a fire stick so there's going to be a little curve for getting used to it but overall I think it's a nice TV for the price.,4
9/14/2023,"this is my 2nd purchase of 55"" vizio v-series smart tv, great tv for the price, great picture quality, sound is good when connected to vizio v- series sound bar and sub woofer. The first tv lasted about 5 years until the picture quality and color started messing up. I figured it was time to get a nother one.",4
8/10/2023,"So far I love it. Has a great picture but the speakers could be better. Had to turn it up to 54 to hear it and it was not noisy in my house at all. My son said I need a sound bar. I wish it had vivid, game, movies but it only has bright, brighter and dim for the picture settings. The picture quality is great though and the set up was easy. I really like Vizios customer service which is why I leaned toward this tv versus others",4
8/10/2023,i really like the tv. The delivery of it was terrible. The driver put it directly in front of the door so i could not get out of the house and they laid it face down... which clearly says do not lay it face down on the box. The tv has a beautiful picture and it was a breeze to set up and start watching. Great tv for the price!,4
7/30/2023,"when trying to set the tv up it never would go through kept repeating the cycle. Eventually the the tv went out and I had to call vizio for them to come out and fix it. Someone was here within a week and got it working, they had to replace the switch borad in the back. They were very nice and professional.",4
7/20/2023,"Utilized free delivery, setup delivery date(Friday) and said deliver after3 (ordered on a Wednesday). Got a text that it would be delivered in 15 minutes at 1030 am on a Thursday. Rushed home to find the wind had blown the box over and was starting to rain. TV works but what a horrible experience.",4
6/27/2023,"I purchased this TV to replace an LG TV I had to replace (cracked screen). It was about half the price of the LG TV, but the screen quality is the same. The only thing I find lacking so far is the app Interface doesnt remember your most commonly used apps, so I always have to scroll through each app to select the one I wish to open.",4
10/9/2023,"I've bought more than a few TVs from Walmart, but THIS time, the problem was, each time I selected and purchased a TV, the transaction had yo be cancelled because the TV was not in stock, as advertised online. Then the THIRD time, the TV arrived damaged. Finally, the 4th purchase resulted in my new Vizio TV!! I surely could have gone to  competitors after so many false starts, but I stuck with Walmart.",4
7/8/2023,"I really like my Vizio 50 inch smart TV. I don’t have to use my Roku anymore. All the streaming channels are right on the TV. The color is good. Sometimes when I go to start it in the morning hesitates, I have to shut it off and then start it again. Other than that I really have no problem with it. And the price is excellent.",4
9/20/2023,"Picture is great. One cannot get MLB on Vizio's, so if you have MLB, you will need an Apple TV unit or something like it to watch. Base is very cheap but it works. Cord is short. Everything is a little cheaper than say a Samsung. Good value, however. I do recommend with the above notes.",4
7/21/2023,"Overall the picture quality is great and even though I like being able to adjust color tint, sharpness, color intensity and contrast, this TV does not offer those features. However, the preset picture options are fine. The only thing that I don’t like is the lack of printed instructions and the fact that smart TVs are focused on streaming services. Set up was a pain, so I guess what I really wanted was a “dumb” TV which are no longer available",4
10/5/2023,The TV is nice with a clear picture.  Very easy to pair Bluetooth accessories. My only concern is now that I've had the TV for a few months I am seeing some quirks. Every other time I turn the TV on it doesn't connect to the wireless internet and I get a Server 500 error.   I have to restart the TV once maybe twice for it to connect. The issue isn't the wireless internet because I have other devices connected and those other devices don't have an issue. Overall I would recommend this TV.  The minor quirks don't take away from the positive aspects.,4
1/29/2024,"easy menu and almost seamless pairing with smart phone. the remote is tempermental but other than that, great picture quality",4
2/9/2024,So easy to set up. Plug it in and in a few minutes it was going pretty much all on its own. All I did was answer the screen prompts!,4
2/7/2024,"I did  not Like 
 Netflix app always  after recent apps. Always.
I like recent apps ( total 8 Apps) that help in browsing.",4
2/3/2024,"Enjoying the voice command, picture ok, not super sharp.  Sound ok too.  Will be better with sound bar",4
1/27/2024,The tv is a lot lighter compared to others. I like that the set up was very easy and fast. Really recommend this tv,4
1/27/2024,"I love the TV, sometimes the picture blurs but I think I need to adjust the settings. It was way to setup and connect to my network",4
10/27/2023,"The volume doesn’t get the loudest. Volume 50-100 literally sounds the same it doesn’t get no louder fr. but really nice tv, I’m gonna get a sound bar to fix the volume bc I like my tv loud for movies and music",4
12/15/2023,"Nice TV with a good picture. Only a couple small problems.......
- sometimes I have to power cycle the TV because the colors are off
- The apps are all very very slow",4
11/20/2023,"It’s a great tv, awesome picture quality but the only con I have is the volume doesn’t get that loud I had to get a sound bar to be able to hear the shows or movies I was watching without the volume being at like 60-70",4
11/28/2023,"This tv is great, but if you have cable you will need to have your provider update your service. It only takes a few minutes. Also, you can use your regular remote once you update.",4
10/29/2023,Overall I am happy with the purchase. It does just about everything I would expect. Did not like that I could not add the Spectrum app. If I want to watch it I stream and project from my phone to the TV.,4
11/26/2023,So far was a great tv the only issue I had was the first week it was acting slow when I pressed a button on the remote it would delay and also I could not connect to Apple Play.,4
11/15/2023,The Vizio 75 inch tv is beautiful and big and shows amazing. The only problem is that the tv cord that plugs in the wall and back of tv comes out to easy like you can't touch it. I hope in the future they improve on that cord.,4
11/13/2023,"I like this new TV quite a bit. My daughter seems to think that the audio is a little low quality, but it doesn’t seem to bother me. Other than that I’m very happy with my purchase.",4
12/9/2023,Great color and clarity. The one issue is the delayed response when you first turn on after a couple of weeks it seems to take too long catching up or updating? TV works great any other time.,4
10/27/2023,"The picture is awesome, it was easy to mount. Kids think is is the best haha. BUT for some reason it keeps disconnecting from wifi, so I had to use and ethernet cable, otherwise it is a great buy",4
11/28/2023,It looks and sounds good for the price.  Hesitated at first but once we finished setting it up now I believe it’s worth it.  It’s not complicated to set it up.,4
1/21/2024,the tv is great but the built in speakers are weak,4
6/4/2022,"I like almost everything about this TV, but there is a BUT... Check out review on this TV on my YouTube channel ""Try it yourself""",4
1/5/2024,"It was delivered quick and on time. I just had to help the delivery woman, due to the package being huge and her not having a partner nor a dolly!",4
7/29/2023,"I chose this as my Livingroom/Gaming TV, it's a nice starter TV, good quality and Kept up with the times. B rating.",4
7/23/2023,The picture quality is nice for the price. The sound quality is not that great so I purchased a small sound bar.,4
12/30/2023,"Great job delivering to the correct door. I just wish the TV was covered in plastic, as it was raining.",4
12/31/2023,The set up of the legs were a little rough to put together at first but the quality of the tv is perfect. I’m very pleased,4
7/23/2023,great quality. we had to change the sound settings because it was really low at first but other than that no complaints,4
1/14/2024,"never gonna get it delivered again. Took forever l, driver kept canceling, never updated me had to constantly call.",4
12/28/2023,"We like the picture and features, but the remote does not have the options/buttons that our older set had.  
I gave 4 stars due to the remote.",4
12/28/2023,"good picture quality from all angles,
TV speakers are very weak, but, I expected that because they want to sell you the ""sound bar"".",4
5/9/2023,"Its better than most in price rang. better then tcl and hiesnce. back light up brightness dow. matches macbookpro screen. cant beat 70 inches for $500. also have 40"" for comp monitor.",4
6/2/2023,"while this is a nice TV the set up was quite frustrating cycling through recent updates 3 times. Then logging into apps required way too many steps between TV, mobile amd PC.",4
5/31/2023,Nice clear picture and true color. Found it a little difficult to set up when you are not tech savy. Volume has to be at higher setting than my other tv.,4
6/14/2023,"Set up was fairly user friendly , picture quality is good , a very good tv for the price . Delivery was on time and box was undamaged .
I would happily recommend this unit .",4
9/14/2023,I like the way that u can order through the app...and have the option to buy extra protection for your purchase..and i dislike that you guys cant delivery tvs...i dont know why you are offering a delivery services...,4
9/25/2023,love the t.v. only complaint is i stream xfinity and can't get on here. My other smart t.v. i was able to just load it from the apps but this one doesn't have the option that i can find,4
10/4/2023,Definitely was happy with my purchase especially the price! I think the only thing that I wasn't happy with about this tv is that it does not have a web browser,4
7/5/2023,"The TV serves its purpose, but I was dissapointed to discover that Vizio does not have the ESPN app built in.  So I'm still using an apple TV device with my smart tv.",4
10/19/2023,"The quality in price and the TV itself, is amazing!  the picture and sound are superb!  I wear glasses, but the picture is so great that i dont have to while im watching.",4
8/19/2023,"Good product, love the tv. Smart tvs are the best thing ever. My only issue is I think it needs better sound. I have other brands and they seem fine. I am seriously thing of a sound bar with this one.",4
9/10/2023,"This my 5th Vizio tv and sound bars. Good products. The pic on this tv is not the sharpest colors but at the price i cant complain. I got same day delivery,wow!",4
9/14/2023,"I think it's a really good TV. There are some lighter spots near the edge of the screen but you cant see it while watching TV, only when the screen is black backlit. Otherwise the picture is really nice. Great purchase for the price.",4
7/20/2023,"It is a nice size tv for our bedroom! I
Like the picture, have trouble with finding my apps, it just does things differently than our old tv, which was easy to use! I just think it is me not understanding the technical side! Very pleased however!",4
7/24/2023,Second time buying a Vizio tv. Very pleased so far. Remote a little too sensitive. Hope it lasts longer than my previous Vizio-only lasted four years.,4
7/10/2023,Easy to set up.  Wasn't sure how to get Xfinity working but figured it out after a while.  Still have to use Xfinity remote for some things Visio set up,4
9/16/2023,"Good price, but it's all plastic and I've never seen a tv with a remote with no record button.  Perhaps the streaming services are subsidizing the production of this hardware...?",4
10/17/2023,"Great color, picture, size, options for this smart tv! I have had great success with Vizio and hope this will last as long. I did get the additional warranty too",4
10/9/2023,This is a very good tv. Bought it to replace one just like it when someone broke the screen on my other one. My only complaint is the volume doesn't seem to sound as good as the previous model.,4
10/11/2023,"So far so good, it's had to reboot a few times but other than that it's a great picture. The volume has to be really high to get a nice sound.  For the price it works.",4
7/18/2023,"Nice %26 big TV for the price.  Pic quality is OK.  The remote control is like the most basic one without many useful functions like back to the previous channel, can’t jump to a channel, etc.",4
7/4/2023,"i like this tv, but it isn't as clear %26 bright as other types of tv's i've seen.  i'll probably need to keep fiddling with the settings to get it to look the way i want.",4
10/1/2023,"The timely manner in which your delivery came,  outstanding service.  Although your price is not right in alot of situations this time it was.  NOW WORK ON LOWERING GOLF BALL PRICES 4 ME.",4
8/24/2023,"Just moved to the area, had to purchase 2 TV's.  We bought a 70"" VizeoClass V-Series 4K UHD LED and a Samsung 50"" 4K UHD.  The Samsung was more complicated to operate, but has a MUCH better picture than the Vizeo.  Overall we are happy with both.",4
7/6/2023,"So. far I am satisfied with my purchase. It arrived as stated….well packaged.
As far as the roqu service, it is so much better than my previous service 
I will order again. Thanks",4
5/6/2023,"Great TV for the price, but had to replace my previous Vizio TV with this  slighter later Vizio model that was available for an even lower price. My Previous Vizio TV crashed a few months after the Warranty was up. The previous model was quirky off and on. I had to hard reset it often because it had screen and power issues. We'll see how this new model works out.",4
5/29/2023,Love the Vizio. Brilliant colors. The delivery sucked!!! Got a message that it was out for delivery at 5:00 (we live 30 minutes from the store) and it arrived at 7:15. I called the driver with no response and the store told me it could be 4-8:00. I’ll go pick it up myself next time.,4
6/27/2023,"I like almost everything about this tv, especially given the price. My only two complaints are that I have to forget and re-pair Bluetooth headphones because the audio glitches if I don't (none of my headphones have this problem with other smart devices or tvs). And secondly, the menu for the smart tv is not very user friendly. There seems to be no way to make a favorites list of my most used apps. The picture quality is great, and I have no complaints about the quality of the audio through the built in speakers",4
6/25/2023,"Ended up being four stars but started as one star.   

There was a firmware update that took 2.5 hours to determine and update. Once I got a hold of a service center manager (went through Level 1 %26 2 personnel to get there) which knew my internet provider's firewall was blocking the update, he quickly walked me through the steps and fixed - using my cell phone's hot spot.  

Love the tv's picture.",4
4/10/2023,"this was a very good deal by price.  SmartTV wasn't my actual goal, but it IS a Smart TV...which means if you like your ROKU stick..this isn't the TV for you.  I miss the ROKU format...so far, I can't set the 'home screen' to my liking...and there are entirely too many options I'll just never use.  The picture is fine..HD...the volume is questionable.  It seems to get super soft/lout for random reasons.  I've tried tweaking some audio settings, and it seems better than when we plugged it in.  It's light, and our old mount fits great...it does NOT work with our old DVD player that connects with the R-Y-W plugs...but the new DVD player i then bought, with a HDMI cable works great.  the biggest issue right now, is that it goes back to the home...",4
3/7/2023,Delivery went well next day from Zephyrhills Walmart easy set up good value obviously not as good as my Sony in the living room picture is above average sound decent great TV for bedroom I wouldn't buy a vizeo for my main TV though I would stick to high end Sony Samsung or LG hopefully I will get over 5 years out of it tried my PS5 definitely not as good as my Sony,4
4/28/2023,"Decently bright, but I don't have access to a lot of 4K content so I can't comment on native 4K. Upscaled 1080i/p and 720p looks fine.
Voice control through included remote is a nifty feature.
Suite of installed apps includes things like YouTube and Netflix.

Comments:
It comes in a huge box, but is surprisingly lightweight for its size. 
If you have short arms, you might want to get a long-armed friend to help you in moving it around, as it's not so much heavy but awkward.
Also, if you are not wall-mounting this set, pay careful attention when installing the feet, as they are very similar but not interchangeable.",4
3/20/2023,"The television is easy to set up and use, however, I am disappointed in the picture. It is not as clear and vibrant as the Sanyo it replaced. The pictures are clear in the center front, but the backgrounds are often hazy and a little washed out. The colors are not as bright as I would like.",4
1/24/2024,"So far, it is good for the last 2 weeks. The volume is a bit lower than my old tv.",4
2/17/2024,has a great picture 4k is awesome 👌,4
1/26/2024,"Slow loading apps.  Volume is Low. Other TV's ( Vizio %26 LG ) Volume is 18 - 20, this TV 28-32....",4
2/20/2024,so far it's good and the young gentleman that delivered  it was very kind and polite.,4
1/30/2024,"clear picture, nice sound, easy to use, i recommended highly",4
11/8/2023,Roku will not operate properly,4
2/17/2024,The TV is okay. Sometimes it's a little slow but for the price you can't beat it.,4
1/27/2024,"Great Price
Lots Of Features
Easy To Set Up.
Doesnt Weigh A Lot.",4
2/11/2024,i like i can work with my phone,4
2/3/2024,Second such TV in house. Like both TV specs. Easy setup and would buy again.,4
1/30/2024,nice tv but definitely needs volume,4
2/11/2024,I love the TV but the audio is not the greatest the built in speaker.,4
7/5/2022,"Ok so I never had a 55” Samsung Tv before but I gotten a used one from a friend who had taken it out the trash and fixed it. I paid $100 if you count the paint I traded it for lol. It broke after about 3 years with heavy usage. 
I replaced it with this 50”  and I’m not even like WOW 4K. That 5-9 year Samsung model which weighed about 100lbs was wayyy clearer and crispy than this brand new more advanced technology tv. 
While the Samsung was $110 more, it didn’t even have the RCA audio output or video RCA that I wanted for my stupid HF security cam. 
Not sure if the Samsung could connect to my network wirelessly but I like how this one can. Perfect for the garage where I had the used Samsung. 
In final, it’s a bit smaller and I personally bel...",4
7/17/2021,"The Vizio is the 3rd smart tv we have owned and not the best. Sometimes the smart cast will not load and you have to unplug the t.v for a few seconds and plug it back in. Sometimes the t.v will not turn on and it has to be unplugged and plugged back in. There is no way to change the channel from the t.v. the only buttons on it are power, volume, and input which is really annoying because sometimes the remote doesnt want to work. You cannot add or delete apps. So if I dont want the youtube app but would like to have the HBO app there's nothing you can do. It lets you rearrange the apps but that it and that's the most disappointing thing for me because half of the provided apps I do not use and would like to replace with apps I will use but V...",4
12/17/2023,came with free channels and apps already installed which was surprising... the savings were tremendous!!!,4
12/4/2023,A relatively cheap TV for this size class. Everything is very good on it except I would say the speakers could use some work. Overall a good value,4
10/26/2023,"The tv itself is nice and clear, but I wasn't able to Mount it due to it not having the pre drilled holes i the back. For the price it's great!",4
12/6/2023,"So far its decent tv. It was a little slow, but it was updating ect so that may have had something to do with it",4
11/30/2023,"I can't modify the picture, no contrast option. Disappointed. Doesn't show colors well AT ALL. light toned skin characters White i e. Asian actors",4
11/24/2023,The Tv is light in weight so it made it easy to mount. The system updated really quick. Vizio is always my TV of choice.,4
11/30/2023,Great picture and clarity; however we'll see if it holds up to it's expectations longer than 6 months.,4
12/2/2023,"it's a smart TV with lots of features which I can't speak on, because I use a Roku with it. Well worth the money, clear picture with good sound.",4
12/7/2023,"Got on Black Friday.. I wanted a TV with bluetooth for my back porch, this works great while soaking in my hot tub!",4
10/31/2023,This TV is really only meant for internet TV subscriptions. It's really not meant for watching local tv stations.,4
10/29/2023,"it's s good TV and i like it alot i don't like how i can't add certain apps like ""Crunchyroll"" but i can always cast it or my PS5",4
12/14/2023,"Delivery driver did not knock as requested. TV is great though, if you're a sound nerd, which I am not, you might want a sound bar.",4
11/11/2023,Sound level is horrible. Will need to buy a sound bar now. My old 32” had way better sound than this.,4
10/26/2023,The tv is great in pictures and sound. Most tv the sound is low that's why they have to add a sound bar with this one you don't need it,4
11/2/2023,Never know what you are ever going to get. I'm happy. Delivery and setup went well. Happy with the picture and easy to navigate,4
12/13/2023,"The size and contrast are great, not too crazy about sound…have to turn up to 50 to hear…my Sanyo I only turn up to 20",4
11/26/2023,Does not work with Spectrum. You have to download through Google play to get Spectrum. Should post it on box,4
10/20/2023,The legs were very hard to connect,4
1/17/2024,"The product is good, excellent picture quality. The UI for the smart tv is a little lacking.",4

1/8/2024,The tv I ordered was a v655-j09 but what I received was a v655-j04. An older model.,4

8/30/2023,"pretty good tv so far don't need all the special affects, i turn off the wifi on the tv because i gave devices.",4
9/24/2023,The deal with Vizio t.v's in my experience is the bigger and more expensive the T.V. better the brand.,4
9/1/2023,"A smart tv but not smart enough to work without a Roku for Spectrum customers. Otherwise, nice picture %26 reasonable price.",4
7/13/2023,really good tv but if you have the spectrum tv app it does not have an app for it you have to cast it from your phone which is not that big of a deal,4
10/8/2023,You really don't need any other service with Vizio TV you can get whatever apps you want. Plus it offers you live tv!,4
9/30/2023,the remote is the worst of the vizio remotes. the centet ok button doesn't always work. That's my only complaint.,4
7/16/2023,"Overall, this is a great TV, what you would expect. The only annoying thing is the Vizio home screen is cluttered with their own content and apps.",4
8/6/2023,It's big… it does have this weird smell.. I can smell it days later .. not sure but I know 100% it's the tv …,4
7/18/2023,"The size is perfect for my living room. 
The color is not very clear or vivid.  The color should be better.",4
8/31/2023,Te delivery is great! My only complaint is that often Walmart is out of items. I wish they would work harder to substitute with a similar item.,4
6/30/2023,"Internet connection can be a little slow, some lag when streaming on Roku or Chromecast. Not a big problem.",4
10/12/2023,There must be a way to get the picture brighter.  I'll have to figure it out.    I didn't get an instruction book.,4

8/19/2023,"It's got a nice screen, high definition, but it could be a little bit sharper, but it is nice though",4
8/5/2023,Surprisingly good picture for a budget TV. A huge plus was free Wal Mart  delivery to my front door the next day. Recommended.,4
8/11/2023,"Vibrant color and functional remote. Last Vizio died on me, but customer service was amazing. This is why I purchased Vizio again.",4
7/17/2023,love the picture. the sound isn't the best. Other than the sound it is very easy to adjust.  For me a good buy.,4
7/27/2023,The tv has a beautiful picture and comes in great.  Only thing is I couldn't down load the spectrum app on it.,4
8/28/2023,"Fantastic visual, just doesn't get very loud. Will need to get some speakers but overall very happy with purchase and price",4
8/10/2023,Nice but hard to figure out the chromecast for screen sharing. I ended up just using my roku express.,4
7/19/2023,I like my tv but I do have issue some with the picture it seem to go blurry and I've only it for about 4 months now.,4
8/2/2023,Cant beat the price for all thats included.  Have had Vizio TVs for a long time now and they never disappoint.,4
9/23/2023,not bad for the price. I like that u can use wirelss ear pods to watch TV if someone is asleep so the noise won't wake anyone up,4
6/26/2023,great size and picture but too much backlight bleed around the edges. Any time a dark scene comes on it's extemelt noticeable. Everything else is great.,4
5/18/2023,"I've used Vizio for years, my last one is 10yrs old and still going strong. Tried another upscale brand but that was a waste of money as picture died after 4yrs.",4
5/15/2023,"Excellent lower end 50"" smart tv.  Picture quality is good to Excellent when viewing straight on.  From the side the picture washes out some.  Speaker quaily and sound from the tv is fair at best.",4
5/13/2023,The issue with Vizio is that they are not compatible with Spectrum Services I believe due to contractual issues that Spectrum is too expensive. But that is true even as a home T.V. Spectrum user.,4
6/16/2023,"GREAT VALVE! PICTURE IS BRIGHT AND SHARP.  HDMI IS AT RIGHT ANGLE AND PULLS AND BENDS THE  CORD. MAKE SURE HDMI CORD IS LONG ENOUGH TO REACH YOUR VCR, HOPPER, DIRECT TV RECEIVER ETC.",4
5/9/2023,Love the price easy setup the only thing I don’t like is it won’t stay connected to my cable I have to keep putting it back on HDM1 in order to get my regular channels.,4
6/3/2023,"I love everything about this 70"" Vizio TV with the exception the sound is not as good as I would like it.  I plan to purchase a soundbar to hopefully improve this issue.",4
6/22/2023,"This is a great TV and has a beautiful picture, but the sound is horrible! You have to turn it almost wide open just to hear it so that's why I'm giving it four stars instead of five",4
5/2/2023,Great TV overall.   Especially if you have a fire stick.  The only complaint is the speakers are not that great.   Invest in a sound bar.  Shipping was great.  TV was well protected.,4
11/26/2023,i like the price and numerous options but i eish the screen apps weren't so congested together,4

10/29/2023,Wish the App Store offered a little more apps but overall great tv and price,4
11/25/2023,It's an overall great tv for the price.,4
12/8/2023,"Dislike the loudness and clearness of all sound.  Color, brightness and quality are amazing",4

10/26/2023,The remote is not very good.  I find it hard to go to the local channels. Thank you.,4
11/28/2021,"I've only had this tv for a few weeks,  but it's nice so far. I chose this brand because I had a vizio (that was still working), after about 8 years and they back their products.  I noticed some issues with my last purchase,  but the company replaced the TV, delivered it, and hooked it up! I will continue to support any company with great customer service,  who also backs their products",4
5/17/2021,"We needed to replace our family room TV. It started doing odd things like not wanting to turn off unless unplugged and etc. I didn't wanna have to deal with that everytime we watched TV. This one is a tad bit bigger than the one we did have in our family room and I'm glad it is. To me it is the perfect size for our needs. Vizio has always been a reliable brand for me. We own an older, smaller vizio TV that is in our bedroom. 

This has a nice design to it and set up is super easy. Even if you aren't tech savvy I don't see you having an issue with set up. It paired to our WiFi very easily with no issues. It comes with apps already pre-installed but of course you can install more. That's the great thing about smart TVs. We don't have cable,...",4
7/7/2021,"Not a Bad TV, Works Good. Is a very fast and Super light weight TV.  Love the voice remote feature.  Picture is a about a 7 out of 10. Ive seen better Screens especially in 4k. But for the price and feautures, It works well enough to play games and Movies/ TV shows on! IF you want a perfect TV and Perfect Screen, this TV isnt for you..",4
8/11/2021,"I selected the Vizio 50"" V-series because of the value pricing and features. I liked the easy set-up and I needed a TV with analog audio output for my soundbar. The picture quality is good, but not spectacular. The TV is excellent for streaming 1080p programming, but 4K streaming or  watching Ultra Blu Ray discs will be somewhat limited by the lack brightness.",4
11/30/2022,"I love the picture but I was surprised not to see a Cinema mode. Also, while I see SDR, it’s grayed out meaning I can’t change it to HDR. I did some reading and tweaking under picture settings and created a “Cinema” mode, and locking it in. But I’m no techie and I’ve seem to have gotten the view most desired. All-in-all, I’m pleased with the TV:)",4
8/11/2022,"This TV is not a bad one, picture quality is decent but the stand is terrible. Won't fit right, was wobbly no mattter how tightly i screwed it in. Finally found a way to make it stand and the tv was tipped over to a side. Just frustrated cause i really wanted to keep it.",4
7/13/2021,"this is a good tv, but it would not hook up to the internet for some a big deal for me not so mush.Also when i tried to hook up the sound bar to the hdmi e arc port the tv would not recognize the sound bar thru the hdmi e arc port so i hooked it up using the white and red wires to audio out ports and it did then recognize the sound bar.It has a good picture and was easy to get up and running.I called vizio on the internet not hooking up and they told me that since i have a shared net work i have to get the admin of the network to give my mac address permission to access the internet,so i dont think it is the tv's fault that i cant get online.I am working on getting access thru the admin of my netwirk.over all i nam happy with the purchase a...",4
12/5/2022,"Nice tv for the price, the SmartCast stuff is responsive, doesn't feel sluggish when moving through the menus, but I use Roku for all that anyway. The tv has  decent set of features, 3 HDMI ports are handy and the remote feels solid with a decent button layout. Overall I'm glad I bought it",4
3/8/2023,For the price this old man thinks its great.,4

9/23/2023,Perfect size for the room.  Easy to set up.  Packed very well so no damage after shipping.,4
8/14/2023,Nice tv for the price and quality of picture is good!,4
8/7/2023,"Tv is great color is a little off, can’t get it just right. Everything else so far so good",4
3/7/2023,Over all great tv unfortunately the volume needs some work even at 30  its hard to hear with background noise,4
3/23/2023,"Pros: Good size TV for a family room or basement.    Solid TV that sits and displays nicely.

Cons: the sound from the TV is mediocre.",4
5/21/2023,Tv is very good for the price. I wood say though adding a sound system would do you wonders. The sound of the tv is not great I rate it a 3 out of 5.,4
5/11/2023,"Do your research first on whatever your looking to buy. The staff is just there for a check, not very knowledgeable!!!",4
5/15/2023,"All in all I really like the tv. Only thing is sound could be better. When I watch YouTube TV, sometimes the volume goes up or down by itself.",4
5/22/2023,I love how clear the pictures are. Only thing I dislike is how slow the streaming apps take to load up.,4
3/2/2023,"It's been fun figuring out some of gge smart features,  the built-in chrome cast is nice, voice activated remote too",4
6/20/2023,I like that there free movies but it is not as easy to navigate as the other tv that I had .  great picture,4
8/12/2023,i didn't like that the delivery people didn't knock and let me know that were dropping my package off otherwise everything was great,4
7/29/2021,"I wish the tv came with the capability to add more apps like HBO MAX, TLCgo, etc. but the tv makes up for it by having a built in chrome-cast and apple airplay",4
2/15/2022,Very easy to set up and connect to wireless.  Had a bunch of free channels included so I was able to test out the streaming right away.  The sound quality could be a little better but a great TV for the price and works with everything out there.,4
5/25/2021,Beautiful display and great sound! My only complaint is that this tv does not have Bluetooth capabilities or a headphone Jack so that headphones can be used with it.,4
12/26/2022,I bought this TV as an upgrade for my office/man cave. Picture is so good! Smartcast is awesome and easy to setup. My only issue is the main button on the remote failed within first month. Contacting Vizio to see about warranty replacement.,4
12/12/2022,"I think this is a really nice TV with one simple complaint that i think they could abolish with a software upgrade. On the Roku TV's the menu is super simple and by channel number. This system has NO menu for antenna channels. Very frustrating and unless you have your channel numbers memorized you have to scroll through all the channels to get what you want. The menu they have for the other channels is very hodgepodged and jumps all over by catagory rather than station number. If they had this straightened out it would be a 5 star for me. Great picture, fast start, casting works fine, sound is decent but better yet it has the audio outputs i can connect it to my home stereo reciever and it's like a movie theater. Overall very good with one ...",4
11/28/2022,The back of my tv had a dent in it and the box was broken so they shipped the TV upside down. The TV it's self other then the dent in the back has a nice picture and is a good deal for the price. I should have returned the TV but i already took it out of the box and didn't want to go through the hassle of a return.,4
5/4/2022,"The picture and sound are great.  I have a Fire Stick on the TV and for some reason the first two times I tried to switch back to regular broadcast station, everything froze and I was unable to switch back.  Fortunately for me, my grandson walked me through the problem and he said this sometimes happens.  This is my second VISIO TV in my apartment (the other is in my bedroom).",4
9/18/2022,"The picture quality and sound is great but this TV has every single random app except Philo, which is extremely frustrating because my daughter watches Nickelodeon on Philo and we can never do that without having to screencast from our cell phones, then constantly press the button as each episode ends. I would've been better off buying another Roku TV.",4
2/2/2024,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've bought this about a year ago and here are some of the high and lowlights

Picture is great with vivid colors and some great options for streaming.  Lots of free apps included for free programing as well as your popular paid ones.  Cool remote you can speak to and it is very intuitive and takes you to what you want.  Love the option to Bluetooth your headsets so you can watch quietly at night is someone else is sleeping.

A few smaller areas for improvement are a few times it has locked up on me and the only way I can get it to work again is to unplug and reset the TV.  It's happened a handful of times.  Then of course like most tvsl now, the sound is not very robust so its wise  t...",4
11/1/2021,"This was the 4th Vizio tv I have purchased in the last 13 years for various rooms in my home. This one was replacing a 50"" I had had for at least 12 years. I was quite surprised that it did NOT come with a power cord, though!! Luckily, I could use the old ones for hook-up, but now I have to sell the old one without power cords.  First time this has ever happened.",4
7/26/2022,"Easy to set up, the TV looked to be in good conditions, image was clear, but not as sharp as I had expected. Then after 40min being turned on, out of the sudden, red little worm lines and contours appeared all over the screen. Changing settings , channels, apps etc would not fix it. I found a fix on YouTube (unplug the TV from the wall for 60sec and plug it back on), and it worked! Though if this is going to be a recurrent issue, starting right out the box, I do not think I want to keep the TV…",4
11/16/2022,"So, I'm new to all this Smart TV stuff. I got this from Walmart because of the price. So far, so good. I have a great picture and the sound is ok. 

I don't know what else to say. I'm glad I was able to drop my cable service, however, some of the shows I used to watch aren't available and I'd have to add a streaming service at an additional $70/month. I already had to get HULU live and pay for WiFi through the cable company. I guess overall, I'm saving because I'm not renting a DVR box plus an additional box and remotes.

I hope this lasts as long as my other TV.",4
11/24/2021,Has no stand must be mounted. Mount itself is expensive for the right kind and if you can’t mount yourself will cost a minimum of $150. Our previous Vizio had a stand. I don’t see big deal about 4K because the view is nice but same as 3K but maybe I am not that knowledgeable about it since I never used anything but the TV/no other accessories. Picture view is great size.,4
6/13/2021,"I thought I was going to love this tv, but I just like it. My biggest dislike is that you can't add new apps,big disappointment. The other thing is the interface is somewhat slow, but that may have something to do with my internet service. I also wish that you could change the interface theme like you do with the Roku. I considered returning it but don't want to go through the hassle. Unless they make some changes I would not recommend this tv.",4
2/20/2024,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I connected a Firestick to the TV and am having a some difficulty switching around from one input to the other. As far as the TV is concerned, it seems to have very nice picture.  So far I'm well pleased with it, especially for the price I paid for it.",4
2/24/2022,"Excellent picture quality, sound quality a little to be desired.  Augmented the TV with a sound bar.  Was also a little disappointed that it did not have a web browser or capability to download app.  Augmented it with fire stick to get the amazon silk browser.",4
12/28/2022,"I needed to replace my VIZIO 40"" TV that had the screen cracked by a flying can of dusting spray ! I had never had any issues with my VIZIO so checked Walmart and they had this 50"" in stock, I ordered it for order pickup and all went very well. The TV set up was super easy and I'm getting more channels than I will ever watch and there are many other options that I will never use but are there if I ever decide to get rid of this TV and get another one, someone may like all the stuff available. The picture comes in bright and clear and I had no issues with sound possibly because I had surround sound already connected to my other VIZIO I replaced and just connected it to this new one. The one thing that annoyed me is the screen isn't 50"" it's ...",4
5/15/2022,"The television itself is great. Everything I expected it to be. Lives up to advertising.
But on the day it was delivered by UPS it was raining and the UPS driver dragged it across the street in the rain and left it sitting outside in the rain. If I had not been watching the television would have been ruined another botch to delivery by UPS",4
7/6/2022,"It will update the firmware automatically.  I think it will be better to let the user to choose when to update,  Because sometimes they just want to set up the TV and see whether the new board product we work properly. 
 When the update finishes, it will restart. And the whole process will need a long time.",4
8/25/2021,"This TV was super easy to set up.  It arrived in 2 days and was very well packaged.  I chose this brand over my Samsung because it was made in the United States and because the reviews were very good.   There are 2 things that I was not impressed with:  1.  the voice to mouth match up;  for the first few days the mouth would start moving with lag time sound following.  After that it seemed to have corrected itself, I hope for good.   2.  this TV has:  Dolby Vision - See it the way the director intended. Dolby Vision transforms your TV experience with incredible brightness, contrast, and color that brings entertainment to life like never before. V-series also supports HDR10  and HLG high dynamic range formats.
4K Ultra HD - With over 8 milli...",4
1/31/2023,Great price for the 50” size.  Quick shipping and no damage on arrival and the free shipping was a plus.  Like that I could pair my cable remote to operate the TV and can also use the Vizio remote for streaming channels.  Good picture quality.  Overall I’m pleased with my purchase.,4
10/18/2021,"The TV itself is great, the problem was immediately after purchase something went wrong. I contacted Vizio because I did not want to haul it back to the store and get another one for it to only have the same issue. Vizio sent someone out within a week and it is fixed and working great.",4
7/7/2022,"Size is great, picture is good but sound needs improvement.  The sound on this TV is just weird to me.  It is sort of harsh sounding, blunt, I don't even know how to describe it.  It's plenty loud but just not what I've experienced with any other TV.  I watch a lot of Tennis and on every other TV I've ever owned the sound of someone hitting a Tennis ball is sort of like you'd expect, a sort of thud sound.  On this TV it sounds like someone is smacking two blocks of wood together, every time.  In spite of this I will keep the TV and just deal with it because I don't want the bother of packing it up and returning it.  The price is low compared to other TV's this size and I do not want to spend more, nor do I want to buy a speaker system for i...",4
6/15/2022,Great Tv and picture! I would have given this a 5 star excpet for Vizio not putting a menu option on the remote. This made it challenging for my parents to set up their TV. Purchased this so they could finally enjoy a smart TV. Just really had a hard time with this issue on the remote. Otherwise great purchase and would recommend to anyone. Great price too.,4
11/2/2022,"Great quality for price. I like that the picture automatically adjusts to the the input--when I play on my gaming console, the picture changes to gaming picture mode etc. The audio is ok and can be adjusted manually or if you want to invest in a sound bar--it's still more affordable than higher priced TVs and overall great experience.",4
12/6/2021,"Bought this at a special event and it’s definitely a great value with one exception, I love watching sports and because of the 60 Hz rate it’s a bit blurry at times. I’m going to return it for the M-Series Vizio to upgrade to QLED model for just $100 more.",4
6/15/2023,Works good. Need sound bar because tv's speakers don't sound good.,4
6/22/2023,Great value for the size.  Pic is  great.,4

5/23/2023,The picture is really good but the sound is not.  I may have to buy a sound bar.,4
6/22/2023,Good picture. Sound from speakers not good.,4
5/23/2023,Nice picture and features. Only dislike is you can't pull up a channel list (we use a roof antenna),4

1/23/2024,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It's a solid TV at an affordable price. Definitely feels higher quality than some other sets. Has some pretty neat features - smart input switching is a nice plus. And I'm digging the Alexa integration, which was super simple to setup.",4
12/27/2023,"It's a great TV, good picture.... the only reason i didn't give it a 5 is because Vizio seems to have an issue with sound quality in their newer TV's.  My old Vizio has great sound,  but my newer ones do not.   You have to purchase a sound bar to actually hear them well.   I shouldn't have to turn my volume up to 60 to hear it in my tiny living room.",4
12/27/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I primarily bought this TV for its smart tv apps, and the box advertised that it included apple TV.  But it does not have apple TV, and I can't figure out how to access my apple library on this TV.  I have an older model Vizio that has an apple TV app, and this one was supposed to have it too.... but it doesn't.",4
12/29/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I had an older Vizio tv and decided it was time to upgrade.  This new Vizio bolted up perfectly to my wall mounts.  The color is great and totally adjustable.  However, I don't think the sound is as good quality as my older Vizio tv.  I will continue to work on the settings.  Love the free channels!!",4
1/21/2024,"It was a gift, and I have not heard any complaints. It worked with her streaming system I guess that's a plus, I wouldn't know don't do streaming system s to expensive and constantly increasing prices.
 Compliments to the delivery service it was fast and personal brought into the apartment.",4
1/3/2024,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am a bit of a Vizio loyalist. I have a couple of issues with my model. Me, it will sometimes go to a black screen and I have to unplug it to get it to reset. The interface is also very slow. I am shaky on whether I’ll buy Vizio in the future.",4
1/11/2024,"Enjoying my Christmas present. Getting use to the different features still. Purchased the sound bar that accompany this model. Was only able to activate the surround sound via Bluetooth. Haven't figured out how to via HDMI or Optical. 
Overall, I'm satisfied with the resolution, the picture and audio settings, and the apps layout.",4
12/30/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Needed a decent TV for a lounge and this tv does the job. Picture is solid and since the last software update, the user friendliness has been great.

Only “complaints” are that sometimes, it is a little buggy or slow when clicking through apps. Sound is decent, but you should get a soundbar or stereo system when buying any big TV. Would recommend if using as an extra TV.",4
1/20/2024,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I brought this one a few months ago I have another one I bought two years ago I have another one I bought 3 years ago and I have another one I bought 4 years ago 5 years ago I have many of the Vizio TVs in this hous,4
12/3/2021,"I love the TV, the features are pretty good and it definitely gets the job done! The resolution is a little less defined than I was expecting but it's watchable.",4
7/15/2021,"Having a very hard time getting tv to connect to wifi. Bought a new firestick, plugged into tv and it found wifi and connected immediately.  Frustrating because i love the picture quality of tv",4
7/21/2022,"Liked quick response and free shipping, which I received product within 24 hours. Awesome TV, the only thing I don't like is the absence of Bluetooth connection.",4
9/20/2021,I am a Vizio fan for life.  I only bought this one because it was bigger than the rest.  The picture is everything I hoped for. I just wished the sound didn't come from the bottom of the TV.,4
1/9/2023,"Pros: outstanding TV, very pleased with purchase. 

Cons: I have to use 2 remotes just to turn it on. Minor, but annoying. And if you don't stream video you have to Wade thru endless apps to get to regular TV.",4
2/18/2022,"I had/have other Vizio TVs.  Great.  The new models have eliminated the TV video description ( INFO ) button, even with the newest downloaded software.  My set lost audio on channel 8.   Time to order another replacement.",4
2/21/2023,I liked this tv. It had a good picture. But just after having it only a year it is getting thin colored lines in the screen. I did what Google said to do to get rid of them but it failed.,4
6/2/2022,"The online purchase was quite simple and easy. Product was delivered in 2 days, as stated. As far as the TV itself, it's too early to say. I mean, I like it. Has good quality picture and sound, etc. Only time will tell.",4
9/20/2021,"Had a bit of problems setting the sound up, but it's fine now.  Really Great Resolution and fast shipment.  Like the extra 2 years warranty Sam's Club had on this TV",4
12/10/2021,"Would have given 5 stars however,  the remote control was very difficult to open .  Had to use the point of the knife to ease off the remote cover so as to insert the batteries.   TV was very easy to set up and picture quality is very good",4
2/9/2024,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Awesome tv. Picture quality is great sound could use a little work. Tv is very easy to use and controls are easy enough for a 5 yr old to work. Overall a great tv.,4
9/17/2021,The picture is good but the sound need improvement. On my previous tv I set it on 15 and that is good I can hear everything but with this tv I have to increase the sound almost to the last level to hear.,4
2/1/2022,Good TV with easy set=up.  The only thing I didn't like was the remote control.  It's too basic for a TV with so many features.  Changing channels are a pain because there are no numbers on the remote.,4
7/7/2021,I really like the clarity and great colors of it. I havent tried everything yet. The only thing Im having a problem with is the remote. Hard to make it louder? Other than that I am very pleased. I haven't investigated it all yet!,4
11/20/2022,Plan for an hour to Set up with immediate downloads required. Play with the picture settings too. Usually defaults aren't best looking. I like you don't have to sign up and it works with any system you use.,4
1/30/2024,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am happy with my TV so far. Great size good picture and color quality. Very easy setting up and using which I like very much.,4
5/29/2022,"It was sent out earlier than predicted but arrived on the due date.  We like the TV, and we're able to take advantage of the Smart functions with NO issues.",4
3/22/2022,Had the tv for about 3 weeks and i had to unplug/replug (antenna channels and free tv channels stop working) it.I have a protection plan so if it gives me any serious problems i will return it and get another one.,4
1/29/2024,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bought at black friday sale and very happy  pic is great all the extra stuff is cool, but like all flat screens sound is not great, but still very happy",4
2/7/2024,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Why spend more when vizio is great?  Not amazing when viewing from a large angle (aka kitchen to living room) but perfect from the couch.,4
8/9/2021,Sometimes the voices don't go with their mouth. Haven't figured out how to make it darker. And most of all you have to turn  the volume up pass 50 to hear your program's.  That's one feature l don't like about this TV.,4
2/7/2023,"Awesome TV.  Good price.  Got here safe and quick. 
It was missing 4 little screws for the leg.  Walmart wanted us to return 
the WHOLE TV ????  Instead I ordered screws on line.  
$5 later - All good now.",4
2/4/2024,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve loved my tv so far; the quality and features are great for the price and I have no complaints so far!,4
8/6/2022,"Know that Xfinity Stream App is not pre-loaded. Therefore you will have to ""cast"" to get your Comcast TV channels from your smart phone. I couldn't download app to Vizio. Otherwise TV is great",4
3/10/2022,My family loves this purchase. TV has great quality and it was so easy to unpack and hang on our wall.  Instructions were very easy to understand for set up. The picture clarity is excellent. It was a great purchase for us.,4
11/26/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Over all I like my Vizio tv.  Just one manger thing I couldn't get my cable provider app on my tv with out an additional device.  This annoyed me to no end.  So in order to watch my programs I ordered a Roku.,4
12/16/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bought this for my travel trailer. This tv in not only lightweight but has a very good picture. The built in features are easy to navigate and use. I am impressed by it value for its size. I would recommend this tv, definitely.",4
11/10/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] We got a 43” hdtv and it must have been hit with a power surge because it would not power on. So we called it in and within a week a Vizio repairman replaced the circuit board and we are back in business!,4
12/23/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I like this tv. I have 3 of these and they are all good. I like the voice command.  However 1 of these tv's does not have voice command and you have to use your phone to voice command.  This is why I did not give a 5 star rating because vizio mobile is terrible. Connectivity issues. Everything else connects to tv, except vizio mobile. If it were easier to connect and stay connected then this would be an excellent product.",4
11/30/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Am pleased with the quality of this TV.  The so-called ""Welcome Package,"" which was not enclosed,  needs improvement.   At least enclose a registration packet and info where to find Owner's Manual.   Such a cold gesture!",4
11/22/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] we've had this tv for at least a year and it has been pretty good.  It has done a few major updates in that time, and when it updates it generally resets to almost brand new.  Which requires logging in again and registering it again, a bit of a pain.",4
11/28/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Vizio has a great picture quality and the connectivity features and free channels are also very good. The only thing I found a bit lacking was the sound of the onboard speakers which are very low volume. A sound bar is definitely needed.,4
11/21/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this tv 2 weeks ago and love the picture and features,  but the sound crackles when only at volume 30 when watching music videos. Obviously need a soundbar but that defeats the purpose of saving money and getting a cheaper tv. I guess you get what you pay for. Overall great TV for the price",4
10/27/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love this TV ! Light weight so I was able to easily lift it to attach to my wall mount.  The picture is sharp & clear .  Menu is so easy to understand and find things. Lots of options for customizing your viewing experience.,4
12/19/2023,"Picture quality is good but only after making several adjustments to many areas. Out of the box the picture is very dark. Sound quality needed no adjustment.  Could not download the Roku app so I had to plug in my Roku Stick and that seems to work fine. Overall, Smart TVs are not so smart, just restrictive. Vizio is a good brand so I'm expecting a long life.",4
12/15/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I actually bought this television over a year ago and I've had zero problems with it. My internet stays hooked up. I don't have to keep reconnecting it like I do on other devices. It has three HDMI ports, which is great because I have my Xbox One S always hooked up to it as the primary but I haven't even hooked up an older computer tower to it to be able to get information off of it for my parents. I used to use the USB port for my passports that hold my movies and I can look at pictures and documents and everything that's on there on the screen. I move the passport to the Xbox One and actually I'm using the USB slot for rope back Lighting on the television which sticks extremely well. 
...",4
11/28/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] have had for a couple months and it's a good tv in general, but i've had to replace twice because of technical issues. i'm a bit upset, but i think the tv was a good investment so i'll stick with vizio!",4
12/4/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this TV on black Friday and received it a few days ago. I love it, picture is amazing, super easy to use. The only reason why this TV is only 4 stars is because the speakers came broken. I called them and they were super friendly and helpful. Once they told me to try a bunch of things and none worked they offered to replace or repair the TV free to me. Told me it would take 5-7 business days so now I wait here with an amazing TV with no sound. Still I'd highly recommend this TV and company if you are looking for one.",4
11/21/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased this for my office and the setup was fast and easy. I normally take quite a bit of time having to tweak the color since I am very picky with color and this TV was just about there. I just brought the blacks down a bit.,4
12/9/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve had this almost a year and the quality is great but there are times it freezes and the tv resets itself or it won’t turn on and I have to unplug. Doesn’t happen a lot but it does happen.. like everyone else the app selection isn’t great so I still need my firestick plugged in. Bonus is the tv remote controls both so I’m not stuck shuffling remotes,4
12/1/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Purchased a couple weeks ago for our bedroom. Picture quality is great, connects to my WiFi better than other tvs. Only complaint is I feel like the TV speakers could be better. A sound bar would be ideal.",4
11/26/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Honestly, I could not imagine getting this quality of a TV for less than I did. My only complaint was trying to get the display picture just right for all the various programming we watch. What looked good for sports didn't look good for a movie, etc. I finally was able to find a view that worked for all and we're happy now.",4
11/28/2023,"Very nice TV for the price, this is our 2nd Visio TV. It comes with may streaming apps loaded and free channels. However the menu is a bit confusing to navigate as you have to find the ""Antennae"" input just to watch regular local channels and the Channel button doesn't work for our local channels because they assume you will be using your cable box / remote (that we don't have) so you have to key in the channel number every time you want to change channels and this makes searching through the channels annoying.",4
12/15/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've had this tv about a year now. Everything works as expected. What I like most is the smooth scrolling and overall speed of apps loading and such. The picture is great and the customizing  features are helpful. Sound is good for tv sound. The only thing I'm not thrilled with is the smooth backed remote. Probably not an issue for most people but with working hands it seems to slip all over the place. All-in-all this is a great product.,4
12/21/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I brought this tv about 2 months ago and the picture quality is great! I love how all of the streaming apps are already set on the Home Screen, although I do wish you could customize them and remove the ones you don’t use. Over all it was a great purchase and I’m very satisfied with the tv.",4
11/29/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this TV a while back and it has been a great TV. There are so many different options for watching and it is extremely easy to navigate through. My children are able to use it without assistance,  building their confidence with technology.",4
11/27/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is the second Vizio tv we have and been happy with the brand. This one hangs on the wall in my craft room and disappointed with the sound. Speakers seem to be on back of tv so the sound out into the room is poor. Hopefully a sound bar will help with this.,4
12/1/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this tv over thanksgiving and I love it's features. It's easy to navigate and the image is bright & clear. The only reason for 4 stars is the speaker system on the tv isn't very impressive, compared to my previous 8-year smart tv. Nevertheless, I am happy with it and I am tempted buy this tv again for another room",4
11/26/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This tv was easy to set up. It is lightweight and easy to maneuver. The picture looks good and the sound is decent for the price point. The only negative I have is probably on me, but the legs of the tv are near the edge. My last tv had a stand in the middle and I preferred that (as did my tv stand that is just a smidge too short to hold this tv).",4
11/26/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am very happy with this tv. The features are fantastic and the picture quality is amazing. The only reason for the 4star instead of 5 is because you cannot choose what apps you want to have installed and have to use what is pre-installed. If you could choose the apps it would be a 5 star!,4
11/19/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've been a Vizio owner for about 4 years now and I love them. The picture is clear. The sound is remarkable. Who doesn't love free channels? The setup is super easy. The prices are always reasonable. This brand is very durable and compatible with accessories. With Vizio you can expect to get more bang for your buck. My only complaint is that I can't remove, download, or update apps on my own.",4
11/29/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I just got this tv a few days ago. It's great for the price but not a great tv. There are so many features that it is confusing to set up. Picture is very blurry in dark scenes. The tv already has bright spots on black screen. I like the Vizio brand so I expect it to be a good tv. I think I will get the tv calibrated and it will perform better. I would buy again if I was looking for a good budget tv.,4
12/20/2023,"Firstly please note that this is a $400 dollar TV thus I had no great expectations. I'm using primarily as an patio TV.
The Good: Set-up and ease of use, and free channels. The colors are OK but I will give Vizio credit as you have lots of options to tweak and store TV colors/settings to your specifications. Thesis a huge bonus for those of us who like to tweak the colors to our individual palette's, it just takes a bit of time and patience to adjust but once dialed-in, they are very nice.  
Also remember, the color / sound quality is only as good as the data being sent to the TV. 
The interface is very easy to use and can be well-managed through the interface. 

The Bad; Well below average speakers. You will need a sound bar. But it integr...",4
12/7/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] We purchased this to replace an old LG Smart Tv.  I am super satisfied with the quality of the picture!  Crisp colors and definition.  As for the audio quality, well it leaves a lot to be desired!  I have spent about two hours trying to adjust levels to where it does not have that tin can sound to no resolution.  I searched online for solutions and all answers were to buy a sound bar!  In fact one of the discussion boards I looked at was a Vizio customer service Q and A and the answer from Visio was “the small speakers in the TV were not designed to provide high quality sound at high levels, a sound bar will resolve that issue”.  WHAT?  I just bought a 50 in Smart TV and you're telling me ...",4
12/11/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've had this for a few months.  Works great!  Use the subscription services - netflix, etc. and antennae tv which works great.   Only wish on the antannae tv channels - remote had a few more options.  Trying to select a channel without scrolling thru the guide.  BUT otherwise great.",4
1/17/2024,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Definitely a good quality TV just don’t like that I can’t download any new apps. But overall it’s a pretty good TV!,4
12/28/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Set up was quick and easy. Tv picture quality is spectacular. Only downside (and the reason for only 4 stars) is that we have the volume maxed out at 100 and it isn't very loud.,4
1/22/2024,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve had this TV for a little over a year. The apps, and feautures are great. The sound could use some work. I’d recommend a sound bar of this is a main television for you.",4
1/12/2024,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have had my 70
Inch for almost 2 yrs. Has a couple spots in the corners but I think that was from bringing it home. Great picture and very easy to hook up to.",4
12/30/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] We love the clarity of the picture but, are disappointed that the speaker is in the back of the unit making the soundbar a necessity.",4
1/3/2024,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased this a few months ago we never got to enjoy so we made sure at the next place. Classy spacious and driveable,4
1/14/2024,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Has a good picture for the TV we purchased. Will do a bit more homework to get a better quality picture next time.. speakers could be better though..,4
1/11/2024,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Our TV went out, so i bought this on Black Friday. So far so good, but I'm bummed that I can't load certain apps we used frequently  in the past.",4
7/20/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve had this TV for a year, the picture quality is great and all pixels have held up. We use this about 5 hours a day everyday. Sound is great for a tv. The built in AMD gaming works great with Xbox consoles. Only downfall is that when the tv stays on for awhile and you use the built in smart tv function the apps can freeze up and force you to hard restart the TV.",4
9/27/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I really didn’t want this brand. A family member purchased as a house warming gift. The sound isn’t the best quality and I have the volume up at 40 and still low. I made some adjustments which have improved the sound. I would rather not have to purchase a sound bar when the television should have better output speakers for the price you pay.,4
9/26/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I don’t know if it’s the e TV or the TV Service Providers (my internet connection is very strong), but we get the “black screen of death” too often, we need to reset the TV every other month and it’s just frustrating. It’s impossible to find the setting that allows you to clear the cache w/out having to reset/restart the TV. 

Other than that, it’s a good TV. 

I would recommend this TV - but not without mentioning the issues that we experienced.",4
8/2/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bought this TV after our TV shattered in our move. I was sad due to the loss of our very expensive TV. And thought that this was a possibile downgrade. Boy was I wrong! !! It also was amazing for my boyfriend ps5. Worked extremely well for our needs. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is sometimes the volume will mess up. And I will have to reboot they system. But it's been nothing that a few mins of patience can't fix.,4
7/13/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this TV a couple of weeks ago because my old one finally broke. I had been wanting a smart TV for a while and I very much enjoying my 50"" Vizio. The only issue is that I have hearing problems and I definitely need a sound bar.",4
7/17/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Happy with the picture and many features of the Smart TV.  However, when there are software (or firmware) upgrades, the TV gets stuck and we have to unplug and restart it to get it to work again.  The ""Live TV/Antenna"" input was simple at first but now is complicated with some of the latest upgrades and often doesn't work properly or showing that my channels are not available.  This happens quite often with the TV getting ""stuck"" so improvement needed in this area.",4
8/16/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I liked the preset picture & audio options that were on my old Vizio much better than the ones that are on this newer version I had to replace it with. Also don't like that every time I turn the TV off I have to do the input to get back to where I was when I turn it back on. Other than that it's great so far.,4
9/27/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bought a tv and the picture went out. The replacement tv had the sound go out. They wouldn’t replace it again…but the customer service was amazing to work with and they even sent us a sound bar for free to make up for the sound not working.,4
7/15/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I misplaced  the remote and gave up looking for it. I was looking for a television and kept coming back to the Vizio's. I am glad I did! The colors, the specs, and the app on phone with a remote with many options are amazing.  I have never been more excited about my purchase",4
9/22/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I brought this product a few months ago and I'm glad I did. This T.V. Has excellent quality picture and easy to work features my only hang up was I experienced fuzzy picture at the bottom so I did a factory reset and I haven't had that problem again not sure if it was the tv or my Granddaugters messing with the settings. Over all good smart tv.,4
8/19/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this about a week ago and so far so good.  It is very easy to switch between live tv or one of your streaming services.  The picture is pretty good as well.  The only thing that is slightly annoying is the volume.  The volume changes depending on whether you are streaming or live tv, so you are turning volume up or down a lot when switching to streaming or live tv.",4
9/17/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] GOT THIS TV AND XBOX ON SAME DAY AND THAT WAS A GOOD DAY. GREAT PICTURE WITH BRIGHT COLORS AND A GOOD REFRESH RATE TO ENHANCE A GAMING EXPERIENCE. DEFINITELY WILL BE LOOKING TO GO BIGGER WITH VIZIO AS SOON AS PAPER PERMITS. LOL,4
10/8/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] As noted in the title, very easy to setup and good picture quality. Only issue we've had is one of the cable boxes uses a coax cable and it doesn't always pick-up the default screen resolution and color so I have to unhook the coax then plug it in each time (weird but oh well).",4
10/23/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Have a new V-Seiries that the display went to verticle lines throughout the screen. Vizio is replacing the unit which I am happy for. Usually I have had great experiences with Vizio, was shocked to see this one fail so soon, but support is great. Thank You..",4
7/8/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Did a bunch of research before I decided on a new T.V. and Vizio was the clear winner.  This t.v. still has those ancient aux/image/ L&R sound plugs so I can still play my N64 on this! And an input Button! I don't know why but I hate the fact that new t.v.s don't have this feature anymore.  Would definitely recommend over Roku. They have hundreds of app channels except for Spotify which just really doesn't make sense to me but I'll live.,4
7/8/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love this tv. I have recommended to customers In store while looking for one. I don’t like the new update to where I change my stations without it going straight to the guide. I like to flip to the next channel. It gets annoying having to go through the guide every time. I want to be able to have what’s on catch my interest.,4
8/15/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Good all around smart TV. Great picture and has plenty of streaming apps. However, on some software updates the TV has to be reset because because it starts acting strangely. Strange things like suddenly shutting off, streaming content hangs, repeating streaming content and sound suddenly going mute. No problem resetting but you then have to re-login to all your apps.",4
10/9/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The app section can be confusing at first but once you play around you will get a handle on it in no time.  other than that its a basic Smart TV that seems to have very little lag and good picture quality.  Perfect for any bedroom but I would upgrade to something nicer for any entertainment room but this would also work well in that area as well.,4
10/7/2023,Very good TV for the price. I bought one for my daughter’s room and one for my mother-in-law. Very nice picture. The audio sound for the TV sounds terrible out of the box but if you go into the audio settings and turn I believe “auto balancing on” it will make the volume so much better. Just go through the audio settings until it’s how you like.,4
10/21/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I had to get new TV, cat knocked the other down. Got this one and was excited to finally have a smart tv. But the apps were so slow to load that I went ahead and plugged my roku back in which now loads the apps fast. Other than that, pic is good and it's a nice solid tv for the price.",4
7/22/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have had my television for a little over a year. No major problems outside of a few software update hiccups. Has all the popular streaming apps and more. Attractive interface and good picture color and saturation.,4
8/24/2023,"Great for watching tv. Terrible for video games.  Way, way too dark.  Had to adjust the tv, the game and the ps5s brightness all the way up and it's till to dark. Also seems to have some lag issues when loading a game map. Would NOT recommend if you're a serious gamer.",4
7/14/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought a 59.5 inch set. In 6 months the picture went out. Vizio replaced it with a 58 inch TV. It has now been another 6 months. This set is a better quality but it has problems understanding voice commands. Like the title says, not bad for the price",4
10/18/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this TV after an untimely accident with our old one. This was easy to setup and has a decent picture. We only watch it an hour or so an evening so certainly didn’t want anything crazy expensive. This one checked all our boxes.,4
7/20/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Had to correct the colors from the default values. Reds came out mostly orange on some platforms. Colors are a bit washed even after correction but not too terrible as I was able to mostly correct the image through the settings. Odd that the volume is only adjustable to even values from 0-100. Why not just have 50 values if they can only be set that way, regardless? When paired with the Vizio 5.1.2 soundbar the audio peaks above what the satellite speakers can handle. I’ve used worse television sets and this is not bad for the price.",4
7/24/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bought the 43 inch V-Series for our game room.  Specifically for my son's gaming console.  He has not had any complaints other than the brightness.  The TV viewing angle is not very good although I do notice some fading around the corners.  Sound is also very good and does not need a sound bar/  The apps work seamless without any issues.  I have also tried out the new Visio Mobile app with the beta  VIZIOgram.  App is ok and needs some work but overall, it's a great additional feature to have.  Please keep this as it will prove to be very useful and used.  Highly recommend VIZIO if on a budget.  It is truly a great VALUE!",4
8/24/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is our 4th Vizio bought all of them are good been buying Vizio since it came out and haven't bought any other brand tv love the product but the speakers on 55"" could be better so I don't turn it up so high when trying to listen better. But other than that good tv our last 55"" lasted us for 3 years and just recently bought a new one",4
9/27/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this TV back in July and started having issues with the volume and fast forwarding. You could press up in the volume once and it would keep going to full volume with no way to stop it. Same with Volume down. This also started happening with FF and RR. Called Vizio and they were quick to send a very knowledgeable tech to repair it. Hopefully will not have this issue any time soon, as I love this TV.",4
6/29/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought my TV for my new apartment, to sit on top of a bookshelf/TV cabinet. The picture quality is incredible! The colors are clear and crisp. The built-in speaker sound quality is sometimes fuzzy, so I didn't rate it 5 stars. However, this issue may be unique to my set and not a bug in the product line. This is my third Vizio TV, I bought two 32"" models, one for a guest room and another as a housewarming gift for my son. 
The streaming apps loaded on the set cover every possible genre of entertainment. I especially like the free movie and TV show apps. Vizio will be my first choice when purchasing TVs in the future.",4
8/2/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I actually had this TV for over a year now, and even though the remote went through a wash cycle, it still works (after replacing batteries and cleaning it up).  The TV has a built-in chromecast, so it's easy to view videos from my phone or ipad, or just use the apps that come with the TV.",4
7/19/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have had this television for a little over a year now. I have not had many problems with it. Mainly bugs in the software updates. These could only be fixed by my perspective by restoring it to factory settings and re-updating. However, the picture and audio quality are on par for the current market. It comes pre installed with numerous popular streaming apps with a large variety of other per your discretion apps available in their app store. Overall I am satisfied with my purchase and quality of the product. Software updates appear to need work to me though.",4
7/27/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bought this TV to mount in my office for general use. Mostly use it to watch YouTube and various streaming services. But the bonus and primary reason for buying this TV was for use with my PC as an extra monitor. Because it has 4:4:4 chroma sampling this makes it a perfect fit to use a monitor. Everything works as you would expect and does a decently good job doing it. The only complaint I would have is that the Vizio OS or the home screen can be a bit slow and unresponsive at times. Other than that I'd highly recommend this TV for the value.,4
7/21/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love all of the features on this tv and VIZIO is a great brand, the only thing I would negatively say about it is that the sound quality isn’t the greatest. However, I know that it’s a smaller tv size and therefore its’ capabilities are limited in comparison to larger models.",4
7/12/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The device seems to be great in regards to picture and sound quality. Packaging was well done, and the protective coverings were meant to stay on until removed.
I would suggest changing the default start up screen that notifies the user that a network is not available, not all people want their devices connected 24/7, and it is somewhat bothersome having to then search for the input that is normally used. I would prefer to start the device and instantly see the programming from whatever service I use, i.e. Dish or Comcast.
Functionality of the remote is good, but again, the start screen requires interaction using the device remote, versus the input device remote, such as Dish or Comcast....",4
10/4/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] So far so good, the only flaw or problem I have had is the TV speakers. Really low quality sound compared to other TV's I have had. I bought a VIZIO sound bar and what a difference. Makes watching movies much more enjoyable",4
11/18/2022,"This is our 4th or 5th Visio. Have always been very happy with the brand. This brand has a frustrating feature that I can't change that when you turn it on, it starts on the ""home"" screen with all the apps instead of ones regular TV channel. Because of that, you have to use 2 remotes - Visio one to be able to switch to regular TV and ones local cable remote. Previous Visio TVs did not do that.",4
8/23/2023,"While I DO love most things about this TV, there is one I do NOT. I don’t like the size of the font on the settings menu. I have Low-Vision which is why I need a 65” TV. And while the menu and home screen are ok, the settings menu means I stand right in front of the screen when I do need to go to that section. Sucks that I have a 65” but the actual settings is on a 3 sq” display (abt. Cause I’m a smart “mouth” like that). But otherwise I love this TV. I love the sound quality and the video quality is awesome as well. The smart features and the ease of use is great. But come on I know I’m not the only one who has a TV this big for other reasons besides just having a big  📺. So come on Vizio, don’t make a screen size so ginormous and then ha...",4
9/21/2023,"Bought this TV for football, it does not disappoint on the picture clarity, super easy to setup as long as you have a smartphone. The interface is a bit laggy but is to be expected in this price range good enough for me. It remindes me of bluray players menus. The speakers is what is really lacking with this tv. I recommend a sound bar with good base to go with the tv and its perfect. [Picture 4.5/5, Interface 3.5/5, Sound 2/5]",4
10/3/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] After setting up my new 50"" Visio TV, I had NO problem going through the set up process.  HOWEVER -  - - - - I was UN-able to connect my Spectrum television service to the new TV.  Everything else seemed to be functioning properly, EXCEPT my Spectrum.  Now waiting for a Spectrum technician to come and help.",4
10/18/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've had this tv for a few months now and no problems I love that it was able to connect to the Alexa so I can control it through that. I would rate this a 5 star but it was hard to set up at first.,4
7/6/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love the way I can stream movies from internet and all the free streaming apps on there already loaded.  Makes watching tv fun.  Makes decision making hard so many choices. Unbelievable when I can remember only three channels growing up in rural area.,4
8/7/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] We’ve had this TV for almost 2 years now, and has great picture and sound. However, it sporadically won’t work for no reason, and many of the apps aren’t maintained well by the external developers. For example, Paramount TV+ doesn’t work properly at all, so we also had to get a Roku for those instances. I also love the Watch Free+ they provide, but again, they have issues like incorrect schedules on the guide or repeating commercials back-to-back sometimes up to 5 times in a row. Overall, I do love the TV.",4
12/8/2022,For the price and quality. It's a good TV,4
11/26/2022,Love the picture and quality for the money. Interface is a little glitchy and klunky.,4
12/25/2022,"Easy to set up.
I had some trouble getting the picture to look as clear as my last Visio.
I have almost figured it out.",4
6/28/2021,"The audio is a little weak, other than that it seems to be a good television.  It was easy to setup and was packaged very well when I received it.",4
12/24/2021,"I bought the same model twice. First one was delivered broken. The second one was bought in the club. It has a slight, yet noticeable, imperfection.",4

12/12/2022,The video quality wasn’t as great as I thought it would be. But other than that I love everything else about the tv!,4
3/15/2022,The picture is good. I took a star away because it takes awhile to load when you turn it on and randomly shows an error while playing.,4
8/12/2021,"Great picture.  Easy to hook up.  But sounds is not good.  Sound from 1 - 100... have to put it on 85 to hear it, sitting 15 ft from screen.",4
2/4/2024,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The tv is great size fits my space perfectly nice color but the remote control terrible!,4

1/25/2023,incredible scale and vivid images; easy to set up; vizio is the only tv ive owned in almost 25 years!,4
5/20/2022,I love my TV. It is well worth the money. I wanted something I could use with the apps easily. The picture is great. I would buy again,4
8/18/2022,I got this Visio TV for my grandma because she couldn’t see her smaller one very good. The price was the same. She’s happy with the purchase!,4
9/18/2022,Works with Alexa - love the remote.  Excellent fir the price.  Picture quality a little subpar but you get what you pay for.,4

11/20/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Set up was easy and so far so good. I had to think 2xs to buy Vizio as I heard thru friends that Vizio was not as reliable as they once were.,4
11/1/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is the first Vizio TV we have owned. It was easy to set up and I like the many different options there are. We will learn about use these in the coming weeks. So far the TV works great.,4

11/23/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] For the price it s a great deal. You get good colors and great 60z for your average gaming console. The viewing angles are okay and the blacks aren’t perfect but other than that it’s a good deal.,4
12/1/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It's a good TV, it has a hard time going between screens sometimes but that could be the wifi as well. It has good visual but not great sound",4

11/26/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am very picky with my color and spend quite a bit of time adjusting it normally but this TV was near perfect out of the box.,4
11/29/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It has connected well and the streaming works great. It hasn't always had a great connection to my phone for mirroring but that may just be my phone. Otherwise it has been a good tv.,4

11/26/2023,We bout this Vizio tv to replace the 10+ year old Vizio we had. We appreciate the clear picture and format of the options. The update was quick and easy once I turned it on and connected to the WiFi.,4
12/7/2023,I like the size and ease of attaching the cable TV and DVD.  I had to call my provider to get the picture full size on the screen not realizing Visio had at one time blocked my provider so no one could use your TV.,4
12/4/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I didn't choose 5 stars because it came with a dot on the screen it's not big but it shouldn't be there I didn't return it because it will be a long process and it doesn't bother me that much,4

11/11/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Has alot of great features.  Would like the spotify app. Watchfree+ is great to have except it would be nice to be able to resume where you left off and not have to fast forward to where you were.,4

10/12/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great tv wish I could have Roku. Great tv nice picture only thing is the Vizio app remote can be a little slow and delayed,4
7/20/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I brought this tv as a gift to myself. After 10 years of having my 42” Vizio tv it was time for an upgrade. I love my new 50”. The only thing I didn’t like was it didn’t have the Crunchyroll app.,4
7/13/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] We like the features, especially the ability to use phone as a remote. We have struggled to get picture color and sharpness right.",4

11/28/2023,"My last Vizio tv was a 37 inch I think. It was almost 20 years old and still working good. I decided on an upgrade. The price of flatscreens has come down over the years and you can buy a much larger screen with more features for less money than 20 years ago. This 50 inch is a smart 4K with chromecast built in. It was $248 which is about $200 less than what I paid for the 37 inch.
I have streaming apps on my phone and iPad and I can select a movie and start it on my tv. Also have the same apps on the tv but I think being able to do it with my phone or iPad is easier and faster.
I could have gone bigger but I think this is plenty big. When I was younger we had a 13 inch BW tv and no cable. 
I think anyone would be happy with this tv",5
11/27/2023,"I purchased the 65” Vizio 4K TV In part on the strength of good reviews but a sale price of just under $400 pushed me over the edge. I use a Firestick most of the time so I didn't care too much about the TV's build in OS, but I found that it's actually pretty decent and offers a nice array of alternative content. 

I replaced a 48 inch 1080p LG and the difference is remarkable. I would definitely buy another one.",5
9/26/2023,This Vizio 4K UHD is easy to setup may take some time updating as you get connected with internet. I would recommend this beauty too anyone and everyone who enjoys a quality product with clear high definition and quality image. So amazed at how great this quality flat screen is for the fair price.,5
9/8/2023,"Love the size, the clarity and the sound…..amazing!! Make sure your current tv stand is large enough for this to sit on top of, had to purchase a new one for this set. Plenty of apps (but not abc) to enjoy hours of entertainment, minimalist remote control and after purchasing (hopefully you catch it on sale) you can enter a sweepstakes for a Vizio sound bar which in my opinion isn't necessary because the sound is robust as is but who's turning down the opportunity for a free useful electronic 😏",5
9/10/2023,"Great TV, picture is great, not a fan of the legs, not as sturdy as I like, this was an upgrade in size from a 43’ Vizio D, to a 50’ Vizio V, crisp, clear picture. To solve the leg issue, I bought on Amazon a center TV stand. I’m sure once I have it put on, I’ll feel better.",5
7/9/2023,"Really outstanding performance, I've had one other Vizio in my life and it's probably 10 years old and still performs great. I basically use m Vizio for Gaming on my PS5 or watching football. So far I have no complaints at all, would highly recommend",5
10/11/2023,Great picture love different settings we like the vivid picture setting. we also like the fact that the soundbar sounds great too. normal sound is good too weight is good also setup was a breeze make sure you download the app first thing also adding my other accounts is easy too very happy and will buy again if ever need one.,5
11/16/2023,"TV is very sturdy. It has some weight to it, but rather easy to mount. Graphics are above what I expected for its prize. The VIZIO user interface looks a lot better than most other TVs and is put together quite well. The TV is very responsive to remote commands and inputs. I don't find myself using the microphone commands on the remote, but it capable. Definitely a great deal and worth the purchase.",5
11/5/2023,I liked the updates and the map showing where the driver was. It gave me a sense of how close they were to actually delivering. The Walmart app also showed the expected time of delivery and how many deliveries the driver had before me. This was our first time having something delivered from the store. A picture was taken and sent to us in the app saying it was delivered but they meet us at the door to make sure we received the item in hand.,5
10/8/2023,"I like ho light in weight. The picture gives an in the theater type of mood. Although I like the Roku products, it's nice to have a product not dependent on third party devices to get the best results. That's what this product does for me.",5
8/22/2023,"Great product, I've always loved Vizio products and this one most certainly did not disappoint!!
Amazing picture, works great with the sound bar, and gaming on it is insane!!
Definitely would recommend especially for the price.",5
9/22/2023,Amazing TV and  great price! Im so happy with my purchase. This is my 3rd Vizio television and they are really great! The picture is amazing. They are very easy to set up also.,5
1/14/2024,"This 50in Vizio smart tv is a great choice if you're looking for a new smart tv.The picture is beautiful and the operating system is smooth and easy to navigate even for a person that isn't familiar with smart televisions.I ordered it on a Thursday and received it on Friday before 1pm,very fast and it is easy to setup. The only thing I suggest is to setup a soundbar if you're planning on watching movies, sports etc,that really is normal with mostly all smart tvs as they aren't great with volume issues.It arrived in perfect condition. I would definitely recommend this tv for the price point.",5
11/14/2023,"Once having a Google screen, and inspired by family to change to Vizio, I have no regrets! The wider screen, the border is so small that it makes it looks almost like Waterfall edges🤣 GREAT TV AND UUSER FRIENDLY 🥰",5
3/15/2023,Easy to buy. Easy to load. Easy to mount. It's much lighter than my old Vizio. It also lets me stream Fubo . Which saves me 110.00 a month over my Direct TV.,5
3/13/2023,Love the new added features they have available. Voice remote. Headset although I don’t know how to connect the head set yet  everything else works great color sound great,5
2/11/2024,Perfect TV and size. Was supposed to come on Saturday but was so excited that it came early Sunday morning! Easy unboxing and set up. Just need a TV stand and we're all set!,5
11/18/2023,What sold me on this tv was the Bluetooth headphones connection compatibility. I am a super early riser in the mornings. I love being able to put my AirPods in and watch tv with out disturbing my husband. The voice control remote is awesome to take you right to the app you want to stream on. So happy with my purchase. I’ve had it for 2 weeks so far with zero issues. The sound isn’t as loud as my old tv so I am thinking of purchasing a sound bar for it. Not an issue for me though. Still over the moon with this tv!,5
11/12/2023,If you're looking for a great quality easy setup picture and sound perfect tv that doesn't break your pocket This Vizio is the one ! We replaced it from our last one which lasted us many long years. Our relatives %26 friends have other well name brands that haven't held up like this brand . Honestly I never take time nor honestly have time to leave reviews however I feel this will help others who are struggling to find a good tv. For them or as a gift,5
1/26/2024,"With 4K resolution, it really stands out if you want to make a statement in any room. One of the best features for me was that they included Bluetooth connectivity to any headphones, so if you wanna blast that movie at night by all means. It also syncs with your PS5 and your fire stick TV so you don’t need so one remote.",5
5/17/2021,"Good size at 55 inches and easy set up, it walks you through everything.
It has tons of free show, movies, etc and apps. It also has it's own free
Tv app that has tons of stuff too. Really easy to navigate anywhere with
in the tv and all the options it has. Remote control is sleek and very easy
to use. I love the voice search. It's so easy. I like that at top of remote
it has Tubi, crackle, Netflix and 3 others, but wish one was programmable
to the app I use most instead of what they preselected. The tv is really
very nice and has vivid, clean and beautiful color on all pictures. Volume
is good but muted do to speakers being in the back of tv instead of
on sides or front, because it's mounted on my wall the volume isn't
as loud as...",5
5/4/2021,"This is the first 4k TV I have ever owned and wow, what a difference!! The 4k streaming is incredible. The colors are super vibrant and it really feels like you are in the show. I was in complete awe watching a nature show. The rest of the TV is just as impressive. The box has simple instructions on it for set up and installation plus there are instructions inside. Setting up was a breeze. The home page has all the most popular apps already pre-installed and all you have to do is log in. Connecting to wifi was quick and easy as well. My home wifi immediately popped up on the scan list and I was connected in less than a minute. The connection was fast! The voice remote is an added bonus and actually understands what you are asking for. The r...",5
5/8/2021,"I was so happy when this arrived unbroken. I have had that issue in the past with big screen tvs. It did however not have a power cord. I was able to use our cord from TV that we had. The colors are Amazing! The sound quality is AwEsOmE! When the kids play their games its as of you are IN the game. Perfect for family room. What a gift this would be for a wedding, housewarming, or just an upgrade. You will not be disappointed.",5
5/7/2021,"This is not a TV, it is an experience. I have another major brand that is two years old and the difference in the picture quality and features from it to this TV is no less than amazing. We don't have reliable internet in our rural area so I can't use the smart cast or other features. I connect it to DIRECTV and the features are fantastic. The colors and detail are unbelievable. It is not easy to connect and program but once it is up and going it is worth the effort. The sound could be better, I have it connected to a sound bar so that is not a problem. I use closed captioning most of the time and due to the size of the viewing area the captioning is not so distracting to other viewers. I would also like to see several more USB and HDML out...",5
5/10/2021,"This review will not feature all the intricacies of this TV but rather the mom perspective. If you are looking for an amazing TV that works great, has a ton of new features then this TV is for you. It is a great size perfect for any room. Super easy to set up. I was able to walk through the set up steps quickly and with ease. Nothing too complicated for set up which was super nice. 

The quality of the TV and what if offers is simply amazing. My previous TV wasn't that old (less than five years) but WOW the upgrade is so worth it! I love the build in apps such as Amazon, Netflix, Disney, Apple TV (that's correct no more separate Apple TV needed. So easy to pair with your Apple devices for screen mirroring. I mean so easy!), you tube, Peac...",5
12/7/2022,"It's very huge I really like it I don't really know much about specs but the colors are vibrant everything is gorgeous I highly recommend, and the packaging was amazing wrapped really well no cracks or anything, I bout a surround sound also to go with the tv but tbh, I don't think I need it because the tv itself has built In surround sound and it's very clean and loud man I'm in love lol",5
5/7/2021,"This smart television is a cord cutters dream come true! Even if you do not subscribe to streaming services, this tv has tons of movies and shows to watch for free. It is jam packed with apps for the entire family. These apps have every category imaginable for me to watch. From my favorite crime shows, live news channels, cooking shows, workout videos, sitcoms, etc. If you can imagine it, it is there. I played with this for over an hour and probably didn't even get through a small fraction of the items on this TV set. It has free channels such as Tubi, YouTube, Peacock, Pluto Tv, Newsy, PBS Kids, KidDoodle TV, Crackle, FaceBook Watch, The CW and so much more. Vizio also has its own app called Vizio Watch where I can stream tons of channels ...",5
5/18/2021,"This Vizio 55"" Smart TV is absolutely amazing for the price! It is 4K Ultra HD which makes a huge difference on the sharpness and the sound quality is actually much better than I expected. It is incredible how much the 55"" size makes a difference in everyone's enjoyment of the programs we watch! Visio has something called SmartCast that enables quick access to many common services like Roku, Netflix, Disney+, and it also has AirPlay and Chromcast built in. Because services like these are integrated, setting it up was a breeze and there was no need to attach accessories like a Roku stick, saving a little money. Like many electronics, there is a Quick Start Guide and no user manual so prepare to access that online if needed, however the most ...",5

5/5/2021,"This Vizio V-Series 55"" T.V. is beautiful and loaded with so many features! Firstly, it came wrapped very well, was extremely protected and was not damaged in any way. It was easy to assemble as there are feet (2) to the bottom of the T.V. that need to be screwed on (which came with the hardware - 4 screws) super easy. It was surprisingly lighter than I had expected but extremely well made and sturdy. It also comes with a remote control that needs to be paired, easy as 123. The picture quality is amazing! It is not too light, not too shaded, just right. The fluidity of the refresh rate was smooth.

It definitely checks all of my boxes for being a great TV.,5

If you are a gamer this is a great 2021 Vizio 50inch upgrade for PS5 console PS4Pro gaming experience!  I use the headset for gaming and Dolby sounds greatness with headset ears for awesome graphics with no lagging HDR.  I would recommend to anyone with gaming passion like myself and under 400$ with 5 year warranty.  Thanks Walmart for the good deal!

It supports Dolby Vision and HDR10, with AMD Freesync as well. The low latency makes it greay for gaming. I'd definitely recommend this TV. I've used it over a year now and have no complaints. The Vizio interface took a little getting used to switching from Roku. I'd recommend this TV to anyone looking for a great gaming TV.",5

1/7/2024,"Great picture with setting adjustments that matter. Easy to set up and start using with an app for my phone. All the little things that I was looking for - sleep timer, bluetoooth so I can connect headphones, easy to navigate menus so my kids don’t need help. Great purchase. Vizio never disappoints!",5
6/9/2023,I was a little concerned about mounting the tv because of the size of the tv but it worked out perfectly. No issues. Absolutely love it.,5
6/9/2023,I really love my new TV the size is perfect for my living room Walmart was very prompt on their delivery and had a good price. Very happy thank you!,5
1/18/2022,This television is an exceptionally good deal. I also use it as a computer monitor. No more squinting to read the print. The picture clarity and definition is incredible.,5
1/31/2024,"For less than $250 who could ask for anything more.
I have owned a couple Roku TVs in the past and I've always thought they were the best for the money. 
This smart TV blows them away.",5
1/27/2024,"I can’t find anything negative to say. The price was right; (my tv was destroyed in my recent move) I barely could afford this. Never did I think that the picture could or would be so vivid and crisp. The live image is better than on the ad. A lot better. The sound is immersive and intense. 
Set-up is straight forward. I think it took less than an hour from start to finish.  I’m only using WiFi and have tons of channels. 
The remote is simple and actually unnecessary. You can download an app to your phone to do everything you want or need. Either way, you can access voice remote and end hunting for shows once and for all. 
This is an exceptional TV at any cost!",5
1/31/2024,This was a great purchase! All of our televisions are Vizio. They are always very reliable and last a very long time. This particular TV was on sale so we thought we would purchase it for a guest room. We recently got rid of cable and needed the technology so that we could stream our favorite channels. The set-up was quick and easy.,5
2/2/2024,"You can’t go wrong with the Vizio Brand, it is plug and play easy. Walmart delivery brought it into my living room for me, my son helped me take it out of the box, he plugged in the HDMI cords, I turned it on, it connected to the internet automatically, updated its software, and VOILA I was watching local TV, satellite, Apple TV, Free TV, YouTube, Hulu, etc… Vizio TV’s truly are plug %26 play! Walmart delivery as always exceeds expectations!",5
4/16/2023,I love the tv.,5
2/11/2024,"I absolutely LOVE my new Smart TV from Vizio!!!!!!  The colors are bright and vibrant!  The set up was a piece of cake.  The only drawback I would mention is the Remote Control that came with the TV.  The remote requires the use of two remotes.  The Vizio Remote controls the Volume while the primary Cable Remote volume buttons no longer functions.  I tried tying the two remotes should be activated by three digit key codes.  But it doesn't which is unfortunate.  However, the TV is great!!!!!",5
6/3/2023,Looks so nice,5
1/24/2024,"The TV fit exactly where I wanted it to with a little push...the measurements where right on but I didn't allow for the ""feet""....my bad!  The set up was sooooo easy and it synced with my other wi-fi gadgets without me having to do inputting on them.",5
1/25/2024,"Incredibly easy set up.  Extremely well packaged, and easy to unpack (cut the straps and slide the box up) Fantastic picture out of the box, no playing with brightness and color settings.  Get a sound bar or surround sound system unless you use only closed captions.",5
6/11/2023,I love the tv so clear,5
2/11/2024,"I love this tv so much the Vizio has been my favorite TELEVISION from my teenage years till an adult, it’s help me through college and  when I got my first house always reliable had my first Vizio for ten year before I got this one and it wasn’t because it broke I just need something new for the new crib, but the thing that I love about this smart tv is the free streaming that saves me so much on cable and satellite bills, bunch of good channels different from the norm but interesting stuff being shown good select of movies too and all the apps you would ever need for your tv ! And did I tell you how much I save on cable bills? I don’t have one ! Free streaming is the way of the future Vizios becomes the Best family television in my opinion...",5
2/8/2024,the visio tv has all the bells i need 43 inch fits in my apartment just fine providing good vidual acuity connections with internet were easy and I  like easy remote control with multiple sites accessible from the remote buttons one touch.I could have gotten a bigger tv but this one is perfect for me. grandpa john.,5
2/14/2024,"I needed a larger TV for my living room as i have a long high wall. The 40"" just didn't cut it. This is perfect with the tv/entertainment stand I bought!
I couldn't afford a Samsung or higher cost tv. Vizio's a great in-between and I'm super happy with it and the 40"" in my bedroom!",5
1/25/2024,Works very well...Just a little problem connecting WiFi.  Once this is activated the push to talk microphone  becomes available .  I was amassed just how accurate  the voice recognition works.  My only challenge is to try to remove all the unwanted channels and streaming garbage that populated the antenna input during setup.  Very pleased and at a great price.,5
5/13/2023,The price was awesome,5
5/24/2023,Love this Vizio nice Tv,5
1/28/2024,I love the size! Also how easy it was to take out the box and just plug it in. I love the picture and the sound. Beautiful Surrounded sound as well And the colors on the picture This was a great Vibe And it also connects to all of Bar speakers And Dvd player,5
5/8/2023,Love it,5
2/16/2024,"Shopping through choices was EZ on Wal-mart app. Picked this Vizio 65"" and it provides a crisp picture and wall mounting was simple. First TV was too small (55) so we easily exchanged and put 65 inch on the bedroom wall in a 19 ft long bedroom.

TV has bright screen even on days when Florida sun is pouring through 4 sliding glass doors.",5
2/12/2024,"Got this TV after our rokus backlight went out. We’ve had it for about a month now and it’s been great with the quality of the visuals and audio. I appreciate the free channels that came with it too. The only thing I wish is that we could download Crunchyroll or Dropout since those are our main streaming services, but understand that it may be a bit niche. All things considered I’m really happy with it, at a great price no less!",5
2/1/2024,"""The tv remote is the only thing i have to complain about!  ""It's very cheaply made %26 i can't change the channels like most normal tv remotes can do, with an up %26 down button option on the remote!!  ""But other than that this Vizio brand ""50- inch color tv is fantastic with great color!!",5
1/4/2024,"I just got the TV and it has a nice picture quality. TV speakers are good, I hooked up my 2018 Vizio surround speakers and the sound never sounded this.",5
3/9/2023,"This is actually my third Vizio in this series... I bought a 32-inch a few years ago that required a chromecast dongle, and a 50 inch last year for the foot of my king bed.  Both were  good, but I wanted to use my headset to get high quality and reduce background noice, plus the voice command feature helps with my bad eyesight and memory... this is the perfect set for the bedridden.  It was quite an undertaking to set it up and go through the registration for youtube, youtube tv and Prime again, but Everything went without a hitch.  Pure luxury for me and highly recommended.  I bought this via curbside and didn't even have to get ut of the truck to pick it up... not heavy, a little difficult to unbox, but well worth the effort.",5
5/19/2023,Very pleased with this 65 inch TV.. picture is gorgeous and love the way it looks on my fireplace.,5
1/3/2024,"I was looking to upgrade my wifes TV in the room from a 40"" Zenith to a smart TV and found this Visio at a great Black Friday price, now she has all new channels and apps to chose from not to mention the visual quality of the Visio by far an excellent choice.",5
12/28/2023,The picture is really detailed is one of the few tvs I've looked at that has av cable plugins for older devices and also has free live tv with some pretty decent channels. It also has 3 hdmi ports one is EARC. This tv is easily worth the amount you pay for it.,5
1/19/2024,"I am very pleased with my new 65” Vizio TV. It was easy to unpack and set up.  It was nice to have an “extra set of hands” because the size of the TV makes it a bit cumbersome (not heavy-just awkward).  This is my 3rd Vizio TV.  I used to be a fan of Samsung TVs but I find Vizio makes at least as good a TV but often priced for less.  In fact, I was stunned by the $398 price for this set. I mean this is a 65 inch Ultra High Definition set capable of 4k.  It seems I see similar TVs by other manufacturers for $1,000 or higher at other stores. 
It has a great picture, nice remote and connected nicely to a Vizio sound bar I also bought. It connected very easily to our WiFi and recognized the other Vizio system in the house.",5
1/13/2024,"The color of the picture is amazing for the price. It's no QLED but pretty good. Wide selection of apps available. I was also surprised how much content was available on Vizio ""Watch free "". The speakers are not great, just like with any other TV anymore...I already had a Vizio sound bar and the tv remote worked with the soundbar with no setup.",5
12/30/2023,I spontaneously bought this tv after my Hisense died after 2 yrs. This tv has surpassed my old Hisenae so far. The picture clarity is excellent. The sound goes as high as 100 but we keep it on 35   are able to hear clearly.  I love that Vizio offers their free channels. I hope it lasts longer than 2 yrs. This is a winner.,5
1/21/2024,"My 47"" VISIO of 13 yrs just would not die,.. But I finally got the go ahead and upgrade anyway to this 55"" .  It has the ARC I wanted to seamlessly work with sound bar using ARC. Love everything about this TV so I will list minor downside. Did not come with printed manual which I like to have in front of me when setting up.  I found everything I wanted through trial and error. Only other downside for me is that it does not have option to choose a different screen size for a given input as my last one did. My older DVR requires that the screen be stretched. Also remote does not have ""previous"" button or ""number digits"" so for a few bucks bought another remote on Amz that does have those. So one remote for me and one for my wife. win win.",5
1/3/2024,I've been buying Vizio T.V's for many years. I won't buy anything else. My 10 yr. old tv still works like a charm. The current tv i just bought was a Christmas gift for my son and he loves it. I HIGHLY recommend Vizio for tv purchases. You won't be sorry!!,5
12/26/2023,10/10 with easy 10-15 min install.  This is the third Vizio in my household.  Streaming is really easy anyone can do it. The voice remote is a great addition.  The picture quality is great and putting the tv legs on is easy as well.  This is exactly as described and are long lasting tvs.,5
12/28/2023,After owning a LG product and seeing that customer service after the purchase almost doesn't exist and since purchasing a Visio and getting immediate action being taken to solve the issue and after a year later they replaced the television with a brand new one,5
1/19/2024,"I love it and the guy mounted it so easily and quickly I was more than happy to pay for that extra service! I have a 50 inch Vizio that I have had for over 10 years and it is still going strong, I just wanted a bigger one. They are well worth the money!",5
1/15/2024,"I like the fact that I can cast to the TV from my cell phone or from my tablet. The picture is great the sound is good, and it is Friendly.  The only problem was that it was a little difficult to remove from the box. You really need two people if you get a 60 inch TV like I got.",5
1/17/2024,"I regret ever stepping away from Vizio. Coming back to the brand and i find i have clarity, speed, and awesome grphics. Only small issue is the strength of the speakers, but i feel thats be cause they aim downward rather than out front. Once wall mounted, everything changes for the better though.",5
1/16/2024,"Was a bit worried about this being shipped, but no issues at all. Love the TV. Setup was extremely easy. Supports a crazy amount of apps. Voice commands a huge plus. Remote is so simple. Great picture. Tons of settings to play with. Super happy with the purchase.",5
1/1/2024,"This is a great TV and especially for it's low price.  I purchased a VIZIO TV 16 years ago and it still has a perfect picture and of great quality.  I remember when the cable tech came for installation...his words were...""WOW...I see a lot of TV's and this is the 'best' picture I've ever seen!  He was right and it still has the 'best' picture!  There are many settings to adjust the TV to your liking.  Very happy that I purchased another ""VIZIO"".",5
9/5/2023,"I am a couple of months into the purchase, and I still absolutely love it. Sharp, clear, beautiful picture. It comes up right away when you switch the power on. It was super easy to connect to my sound bar, and all of the Settings are easy to adjust. This was a replacement for another brand that I thought I wanted… I have a Vizio in my bedroom, that used to be in the living room, but I wanted to go larger. I bought another brand that starts with the letter L and its other letter is G, and it was an absolute nightmare of a television. Antiquated tech, fuzzy picture, and everything on NBC had the audio delayed. I was using YouTube TV, and couldn't watch anything on NBC. When I got the Vizio, straight out of the box, it was/is perfect. I will ...",5
7/18/2023,"This TV is fantastic! It was so easy to set up, the tutorials walked through each of the steps and we had all of our streaming video accounts up and running within 30 minutes. The quality is fantastic, and what a great price!

Additionally, we originally set up shipping, which would have taken 3 days. We were pleasantly surprised when our local Walmart called and delivered the TV at no additional charge less than 24 hours later.",5
8/29/2021,It's a perfect size and not heavy at all. Love how I just connect it to wifi with no extra cords or anything going on,5
2/27/2022,Very awesome the pictures and Quality i have been purchasing this Brand since it first came out love ❤️ my Vizio,5
11/6/2023,Love this TV. Great picture and easy to set up all of the smart features. I had a prior TV in this same model that broke after a year and Vizio was amazing at replacing it.,5
1/29/2024,This great so far. But when I was buying this though PayPal someone use my account n bought something for$309.37 at the same time. So beware of your accounts,5
1/23/2024,The TV performs exactly as described. I like the screen size and screen clarity is great. The remote is easy to understand and work and the screen is a perfect size.,5
1/31/2024,Has lots of great apps. I can connect Bluetooth headphones when I don't want to wake up anyone but still watch TV. This TV replaced my 10 yr old vizio so I've had a good experience with this brand.,5
2/8/2024,Ordering on line was easy and the tv was delivered the next day. The picture on the screen is so much better than my old 43 inch tv. The tv has many other options for streaming. This is a great tv for the price.,5
1/29/2024,I already have one like this in my  den and have enjoyed it.  I bought this one for my grandson for Christmas for his first home and he loves it.  I would highly recommend it.,5
1/25/2024,Purchased this TV back in August and as of now everything works great and looks very clear. The television is mainly used for gaming. It is connected to my PS5 and looks good.,5
2/5/2024,this is an excellent TV for the price I hesitated buying but because of all the positive reviews I have been reading about this TV I decided to give it a try and I do not regret my decision it is a beautiful TV,5
1/22/2024,"This is by far the most beautiful Vizio I have ever owned. I started using only this brand about 8 years ago. Have never yet been disappointed. And this seller is right on the money timewise, information, great person to do business with.",5
1/28/2024,"I love my big TV.  Its working just fine.  I  prefer Vizio.   My previous TV was Vizio.  It was still working,  gave it to my daughter.   It is over years old.    can't go wrong yrusting a Vizio!   The cost was amazing!",5
2/5/2024,"Good product so far. Only complaint was the set up process took way too long. It wanted to scan the QR code, log into your email, create an account, pick out show genre’s… and a few other steps I felt was a bit much",5
2/14/2024,Im very happy with this tv. It's  my 2nd vizio. The picture is perfect and sound is good too. I had my first vizio for 12 years and never had a problem. Just wanted two tv's.,5
1/29/2024,"i like the clear, crisp color. fits perfect as my living room is small.  this is my second vizio.  my first one got hit by lightning so i had to purchase another.",5
1/25/2024,"The last Vizio tv that I had lasted almost 16 years. It just stopped working, it wouldnt turn on. I hope that this one lasts that long. Great picture and was easy to set up.",5
2/14/2024,"I appreciate the timely delivery.  The clarity, brilliant colors and great audio allows you to experience every moment on screen.  I enjoy my time on the couch watching great movies and listening to music.",5
2/5/2024,"I had no trouble with my order. I ordered on Saturday and I got it on Sunday.  I love the TV.  Excellent picture, not hard to set up. AND THE PRICE WAS AWESOME!!!!!.",5
2/17/2024,Marc  was beyond extremely helpful with assisting me to secure my TV on top of my car.  Best customer service I've experienced at this Walmart in 12 months,5
2/11/2024,The only thing I dislike is the fact it does not have the app Crunchyroll I am a major anime buff so it's disappointing that I have to airplay my anime shows from Crunchyroll otherwise it functions perfectly,5
1/31/2024,"Very nice, clear picture, lots of other features since it's a smart TV. I'd recommend to buy it. I've only had it for a couple of months so I don't know about any problems that still may occur.",5
12/10/2023,I bought two 65 inch Vizio Smart TV's during Black Friday. One for myself and one for my daughter and her daughters. As usual they meet ALL Expectations (so far). I would definitely recommend them to anyone who wants to buy one for their family home or for a gift that should last you for years with no problems.,5
12/1/2023,"The move is to buy during Black Friday and ship to your house. Free shipping, came literally the same day. So super affordable fast delivery. Can't beat that. Vizio is a great tv brand. These newer models are super light weight, come with feet to attach (I mounted it.) Great picture. Only thing I dislike is the remote size and button options. Very small and easily misplaced.",5
12/2/2023,"This TV is super easy to set up. The picture and sound quality are excellent right out of the box.
Vizio's user interface is superior to Google TV. The settings menu is much more user friendly and intuitive. Vizio's streaming platform is complete with so many free live channels and every streaming app you can think of is available. Hooking up an over the air antenna and tuning in local channels completes the package!
We got this for my mom who recently moved into an assisted living facility. I like the everything about this TV better than my Sony that cost twice as much.",5
12/12/2023,Great picture and functionality. Only problem was very slow installation download. It took four hours to install software before the TV was ready to use. I have a medium speed connection and it consumed 3 gigabytes of data and I only get 50 gigs of data per month. Because it consumed so much bandwidth I will likely be without high speed internet for the last few days of the billing period. This is not Walmart's fault. I would like to see Vizio have software preloaded that would allow use of the TV with less download time.,5
11/29/2023,"I saved $71 on this TV. I wanted a bigger TV for the living room.  I found this bargain but worried it might not be a good TV. I was wrong.  The picture is so crisp and the colors are beautiful.  It was easy to set up by myself.  I am not very tech savvy, but I even managed that by myself.  I did buy a soundbar with the savings as the speakers on the TV don't face forward. They blurred the dialog and made it hard to understand. Soundbar cured the problem.",5
12/8/2023,Quality and sound is amazing. Along with this tv I bought the Vizio sound bar and wireless (also Vizio) subwoofer. Yes this is the best I can't wait to finish up setting up my living room so I can really enjoy watching a great movie with the sound yes I know and I can't wait. Get it ALL,5
11/2/2023,"This TV gets great marks on the price, the tech inside also makes it an easy win for most buyers. As a gamer you can't beat the VRR support, Dolby Atmos and Vision HDR 10. All the current bells and whistles most gamers through around the web. 

Slight ding for me is a gamma issue i can't seem to solve which leaves most red colors seemingly oversaturated. Other than this great TV. 120hz would be a killer feature at this price. Time will tell oh and maybe Xbox Cloud gaming support.",5
11/9/2023,"A good T.V with a great price. The clarity is exceptional and everything I would want in a T.V and more I might want later but not ready for. All in all, a great T.V. I have waited a couple months now for this review to put it through it's paces and I could not be happier with it. There it is.",5
12/3/2023,"Its not to heavy, its great for your bedroom.  I've been buying Vizios ONLY since 2010 Im the type of person that wants a tv in every room and this is a great addition. What i noticed is we cant get our tvs fixed you have to buy another so only time will tell 👍🏾 Buy it from Walmart ❤️",5
12/7/2023,Delivery driver stole my TV. They did not get a signature from me so now I’m left with waiting on a refund for the amount of the TV that I bought when they quickly chose not to deliver and chose to steal the TV. So I have not been able to enjoy anything.,5
12/11/2023,"Was happy with purchase, but had to return it due to the fact that  have another Vizio tv in the same room. Each remote from both tvs were controlling each other.

That is The only reason why I had to return the tv. There is no way to reprogram the remotes to work o oh with one tv unfortunately.",5
12/11/2023,"We got this tv to replace our older one that kept losing internet connection. But the picture on this one is amazing, it's like we are in a movie theater watching our favorite tv shows.  Crystal clear picture and installation of apps is also very easy.",5
11/30/2023,I ordered online however I did pick unit up via curbside young man was very pleasant quick and also had a partner with him. Brand new out the box no problems have everything I need can't wait to play with my new baby big Vizio customer I brag on them so much lol like I own it. Thanks and great job Vizio and Walmart!! Satisfied happy customer…PS just got approved for a Walmart card w/ great limit yayye. Happy holidays everyone be kind spread love and be safe!,5
11/26/2023,"Did not want to spend too much, do not need the latest.  3rd TV of this brand.  Easy setup, sharp picture, no dead pixels, good enough sound. Have Airplay %26 Smartcast; important features for us. Tolerable wait time when changing channels.  Walmart pickup was easy.  Good price.  Very happy with purchase.",5
12/13/2023,"As with our previous Visio tvs, this one appears to be great in programming, picture clarity, remote control ease of use, and generally a wonderful television!
I would definitely recommend this produst and I would buy it again!  Can't get much better than that!",5
12/9/2023,"I bought this tv to replace a 50"" Magnavox that stopped working.  The picture on this Vizio is beautiful and clear. Setup was very easy and having all streaming apps built in is great. Great TV! If youre looking for a great tv with a beautiful picture, tgen i highly recommend this tv.",5
11/21/2023,"This tv is working very well for us. When the Roku is buffering, the Smartcast is quicker. Even though our living room is small, the size is great. Hooked up easily, and mounted on the wall. Definitely need the soundbar. I've always liked our Vizio TVs, hoping this lasts.",5
12/2/2023,"Shipping was so fast. I ordered this tv at 6 pm and it was in my doorstep at 7:45 am the next morning. Set up was easy, picture is good and it's not too heavy considering its size. I think m it weighs about the same as my older 43 inch that I replaced it with. I can't really speak for the streaming service or smart tv part of it. We use Apple TV for everything",5
12/18/2023,I love the picture quality on this. I had a 32 inch that was a different brand and this picture and sound are much better than I expected on this. I don’t have to worry about not finding what I want. It has tons of apps and I’m glad it’s all right there on the Home Screen. The remote is easy to use not too big like some tv remotes. I love everything about this! It was so easy to set up too but then again I’m pretty tech savvy.,5
12/17/2023,"The picture, the sound and most importantly the PRICE. It was easy to set up, and you can pair it with your smartphone! I’m not a tech person but I was able to put all my apps on it that I wanted, it also had apps like Netflix and YouTube and Hulu already programmed, I just had to log into my account! I am super happy with this purchase!",5
11/23/2023,"Huge, clear, great price for what u get. It has everything you want or need built to watch or stream anything and u really don't even need your cable service anymore as it has live local channels as well. 
The only drawback is that the new remote is small and few buttons but any older Vizio remote works great so I was set.",5
10/27/2023,"Purchased for mom who was having a difficult time seeing her 47"" screen. This solved the problem. Setup was easy. Picture and sound are excellent for a tv at this price point. We had it shipped and was delayed over and over. FedEx kept saying it was ""out for delivery"" but then it wouldn't come. Pretty frustrating as there was no one to contact (according to Walmart and FedEx). But it finally showed and has been a great buy.",5
11/22/2023,"Everything was a great process. Fast shipping, I love this TV. It’s a smart TV %26 I can access cable. It shows very clear. Highly recommended. The only thing that I struggled with was screwing the legs on but it’s all set up. Thank you Walmart. 
Happy holidays everyone.",5
12/7/2023,"Using in my workout gym in my basement. 
This tv is Bluetooth so I use my earbuds when on the treadmill or working out. 
I use the tv speakers when folding laundry. Have had absolutely no issues with the delivering.  The tv has great picture. I watch Netflix. Prime. Or built in channels. 
Love it !! 50” is a good size for anywhere.",5
12/22/2023,"Offers a nice Mid-range experience  for a low range price.  the picture is clear, the menus are simple, the remote is self explanatory,  and the T.V. has tons of apps and free channels to choose from. 

people mention the tv being super quiet.  It was for me out of the box, but then I tinkered with the sound settings and had it auto-balance the sound, and it was fine after that.  (I am hard of hearing as well...).

If i had one thing I wish i could change, it would be the home screen, because I really dont like all the extra ""view this or try this"" stuff on the menus, and would like to have all my preferred menus first...but the fact I can arrange the menus I do use so that my most common apps are in an order i prefer them is enough to make...",5
11/4/2023,"I have had the television for a little over a month.  My initial thoughts are the value you get at this price point is difficult to beat.  I was able to purchase this TV on sale for $375.  Being able to purchase a 65"" television from a well known manufacturer with a strong history in making quality electronics for a long time, is unheard of.  If you set proper expectations with what the television is going to offer then you will be very happy with this purchase.  This TV is not going to have the dynamic crystal clear pictures, it will not have a lot of custimation settings, and backlighting issues can be noticeable at times.  You will get a very big screen that is very sleek with very good picture quality (not amazing but ok).  The interact...",5
11/20/2023,"Loving this tv. The picture and price are great. I got my tv this past Friday. Had it delivered from a store. Came the same day I purchased it online. Was easy to set up. I tinkered around some with the settings a bit, and now have the picture settings I like. Highly recommend this set to anyone considering a purchase 👍",5
12/9/2023,"I was introduced 2 Vizio several years back %26 it's always been a reliable brand. Now, we family has 4 of them, including this that I just purchased. What I liked most about is the customer service. I had an issue w/this TV's remote %26 all I had 2 do was instant message them %26 within a week or so, they sent me a new remote. What i didn't know is that Vizio remotes are suppose 2 be interchangeable, in that, 1 remote is suppose 2 operate another TV if ever there's an issue which X-plains why they sent me the same remote 4 another TV of theirs that I have but pre-programmed 4 this TV. 

At any rate, I like the picture %26 sound qualit. The  setup is rather easy, including the setup of the use of their app 4 matters like warranty registrati...",5
11/26/2023,"Works great, great picture, decent sound. I probably will add a sound bar to this. It has an HDMI port specified and ready for a sound bar. Beware this TV does not have a ""tuner"" in it. You will not have channel 3, 4, 5.2, 7.3 etc. It is not something I need, but just know if you plan to tune to stations with an antenna, this model will not do it. I chose it because it has a MULTITUDE of viewing apps. This is it biggest feature,",5
11/26/2023,This tv works as expected. The measurements are true to size which was important for me because I was trying to ensure it fit on the current tv console table I have. The tv is clear and the sound is clear. I have no complaints from this purchase. Easy pickup from Walmart as well.,5
12/11/2023,Great price and super fast shipping!    The tv was even more than I expected.  Not only did it hook up to my satellite but the built in WiFi connect to my network.  I was able to watch Amazon prime with ease.  Also Vizio seems to have their own streaming service which if you didn’t have another source at least you could watch tv.,5
9/15/2023,Everything about this tv is surprising in a good way. Sound and pic are way better than lg or samsung at the same level. Feel ripped off that I went with the big brands when this tv gives you exactly what u want without breaking your wallet.,5
5/6/2023,well I just hooked us up today as I purchased it. very light. easy to mount to the wall. picture is beautiful but as I said I just purchased this today. so far I am very happy with this TV. but I will really let you know if I have to add to this if there is a problem.,5
2/14/2023,Very lightweight. Crisp picture and affordable.,5
7/21/2021,Great picture and everything,5
7/11/2022,I love it. Wander over Yonder is brand new again. The picture is amazing.,5

9/28/2022,Truly a great purchase awesome smart tv,5
1/2/2022,Works great and is very clear from various angles.,5
1/17/2024,ordered tv on Saturday and was picking it up that afternoon.  it was easy to set up picture quality is great. this is m y first Vizio will buy another soon,5
1/8/2024,Make sure that you check the width of the TV stand!  We had to use two small bookshelves to set it up in the bedroom...temporary set-up during recovery. Works great! I like the Vizio brand.,5
1/19/2024,TV is great. Color is awesome. Sound could be better. Package was a bit damaged with shipping. Nothing was broke but next time will do in store pick up.,5
1/4/2024,"We've bought Vizio TVs for years and for good reason.  This is a ""smart"" TV with great features and easily accessible streaming features and a clear, beautiful picture on every channel.",5
1/1/2024,"I love everything about VIZIO! I had one many years ago and when that went out, I bought a Walmart brand TV. That went out and I bought another Vizio. It is an amazing TV.",5
1/10/2024,"TV has a great picture and sound quality is great.  Set up and smart features make it a snap to start watching right away.
Remote functions are very easy to use.",5
1/10/2024,"Great color and sound.  Easy to setup, but took a little longer than expected, with all the updating it had to do.  Paired with my Fire stick remote so it was integrated to the Vizio remote.  Pleasantly surprised about that.",5
1/2/2024,I would recommend this tv. Color is amazing and sound quality is great. Not to mention the free channels and movies that is provided with out singing up for a subscription.,5
1/7/2024,you can Bluetooth in your own headphones.  I seen this in the description and it was an answer to a problem we have i. our household.  loud TV gone!!!! Thank you Vizio!!!,5
1/19/2024,I bought this TV for my daughter. It was a birthday present for her and her boyfriend for both of their birthdays and they just love it. I love it great price big TV screen just what they needed Thank you Walmart once again.,5
1/13/2024,Vizio is such a good name brand.  have used them for over 15 plus years.  glad you sell them as have the last three from my Tarpon Springs walmart.very dependable.,5
1/4/2024,I love the Vizio brand. Smart tv is great the size is great. It's in my living room ! I also love the fact you can talk to the remote and it does what you tell it to,5
7/25/2023,Very good quality television.  Easy set up.  Only caveat is it wants to go to smart tv choices rather than straight to cable that I want.  Picture quality is very good and price was excellent.,5
1/12/2024,Has everything you want it to have. Speakers are decent would recommend a sound bar system for sure but for the price it's a 5 star for me holds up well.,5
1/10/2024,This television is a great investment for me and my Family! It's exactly what I wanted and needed! I'm very happy with it! It's Beautiful ! We love it!,5
12/29/2023,"Pro's:  Great color management, timely software update, quality of product!
 I maybe biased, since i inherited a very good Vizio lcd 40"" ,just died!

Cons : None yet!",5
1/3/2024,"Television is excellent...especially for the price.  But the delivery was horrible.  No damage, but they placed my big screen TV outside of the gates in the bright day.  Only by the Grace of God it did not get stolen",5
1/4/2024,Tv is great!  Clear viewing and the perks on the tv are great as well. Perfect size for me. Price is reasonable as well. I have had Vizio Tvs for awhile and I like them. Vizio Tvs are great.,5
1/19/2024,"At first, I had trouble setting up the TV, but now that I got it working, I am so in love with my TV.  It is so clear as if I'm at the movies. I'm so happy with my choice.",5
12/24/2023,Mine was busted when I plugged it in took back no hassle at all. I don't take things back normally because of the hassle s and make me feel like a criminal very well done,5
8/26/2023,"The tv is working great but being age 70, I am struggling with the operation. The boice remote does have numbers for charging the channels.  I have to live with that issue.",5
12/25/2023,Read a ton of reviews on other brands. We have had this brand for years and has been great. Went from a 32inch to 50inch and will never go back to a smaller TV.,5
12/23/2023,I bought this on sale and it is fantastic! The picture and sound are amazing! It's also nice not to have the Netflix set up showing by my TV. I have always bought Visio TV's and this one did not disappoint!,5
1/13/2024,Great TV for the price. Bought it for my mother to upgrade her 20 yr old set.  Easy to operate. She's in her 80 s and figured it out very quickly. Great picture.,5
1/6/2024,"This TV right out of the box set up, connected to cable and was ready to go. Beautiful picture, clear and the size was perfect. Would recommend for the price anytime!",5
1/13/2024,"This is a great TV it if the box! For a value TV the speakers are wonderful and not tin sounding. You do not need a sound bar if you don't want it. 
The picture is brilliant and works perfect for gaming.",5
12/23/2023,"I’ve had it since August 2023 now since I moved to my new house and it’s December, about to be janruary 2024 and the tv has Been great so far. No complaints at all highly recommend",5
7/3/2023,"Great TV for the price! 
The only drawback is the remote not having channel numbers, or stop, pause, rewind, and forward. What it does have is voice control, so if you can master that, you're set!",5
5/12/2021,"Wow! We love this big Vizio TV! This tv replaced a 32"" old model that was impossible to play and enjoy video games on. This TV has a beautiful clear picture and great sound. It's perfect for gaming. Vizio makes great product lines and this M Class tv is the perfect choice of value and quality. We would heartily recommend this model!",5
8/20/2023,"The 70"" Vizio V705-J03 is an excellent tv so far.  The delivery was smooth - no issues with cracked screens or missing remotes.  The initial hook-up was easy and connecting everything was simple.  Initializing the app with my credentials and passwords is time-consuming but par for the course.  The functionality and overall picture is absolutely gorgeous.  60 frames per second is ample for streaming Netflix, HBO and YouTube TV.  I did purchase a 36"" Vizio soundbar to compliment the theater-like experience.  My only gripe has been an odd smell from the TV that has been there since the intial plug-in.  3 weeks later and the smell has diffused; and a myriad of people have experienced this anomalous smell.  Apparently, it is just part of the ele...",5
8/4/2023,"LOVE this TV.  I was a little worried with the negative reviews, but I'm so glad that I purchased this TV.  It's huge (I upgraded from a 60 inch) and the colors are crisp and the detail jumps off the screen.  I'm seeing movies in a different way with the 4K UHD.  Great value and the delivery went pretty smoothly.  Would 100% buy another one, if needed.  I've loved Vizio products for a while and am happy with this product.",5
8/21/2023,"Great TV!! Purchased this for my mother after being the test dummy for the 60 inch version! She loves it a lot and has since gotten rid of some monthly subscriptions. The TV had shows on demand, like Maury, news channels, cheaters, even children’s shows!",5
10/8/2023,"Vizio 55"" TV. Great television for the money and brand name. Set up super easy. My Cox Contour remote is automatically set up with it. You can use just one remote, which I love, The cox contour remote. Picture is great, I don't like vivid, but you can choose between 4 pictures of color. the rest was just easy, downloading on it's own.  I love it. 
The remote it comes with is very much like an amazon stick. But I don't use them. One remote is important to me.",5
10/7/2023,"I like having it connected to both DIRECT TV  and also the internet ...I really  like all buttons on remote for NETFLIX..CRACKLEE..PLUTO..WATVH FREE...SPEAKER BUTTON TO ASK QUESTIONS..
IT'S GREAT TO USE THE CHROMECAST TO PUT STUFF ON TV SCREEN FROM MY PHONE ETC
.I'M REALLY ENJOYING THIS TV,!!",5
10/14/2023,"awesome tv. when compared to my same year, make LG tv of similiar spec, but twice the price, it is really in its own class. it pairs amazingly with the vizio sound bar and sub. sound is crystal clear and the bass is better than i got out of the LG. Remote is perfect size and the features are great.",5
10/11/2023,"I say typical because, even thou I read negative reviews, this TV, like every Vizio I have purchased in the last 20 years, have been packed well, arrived in excellent shape, has assembled easily, and put into my “ system” in minutes!!!
This review could get more detailed but I have TV to watch!!
Enjoy this one as much as I!

This TV's pic is amazing! The color is exactly why I wanted to upgrade to 4x!!",5
7/11/2023,"It's amazing how fast the electronics world changes.  I've owned several Vizio products over the last 10 years, along with Samsung and others.  Every time a purchase a new TV, I can't believe how sharp the picture is compared to a TV I purchased 2 years ago.  It's kind of like cars, what is cutting edge and only on highline models, will be on every car within 10 years.  The electronic industry is doing it in 2 or 3 years.",5
8/16/2023,"Is as described. The only thing I didn't like was the delivery was weird. I was expected to figure out how to get the tv from the curb at the front of my apartment to my apartment door on my own and actually told that's my problem. When I got there to meet the guy he ended up dollying it because it was just me and my 2 small kids, but the fact that I was told it was my problem and expected to drag a 70in tv all the way from the front of my apartments to my door is ridiculous. He should have dollied it to my door in the first place. It was almost a return if he hadn't.",5
9/29/2023,I'm greatly appreciative about the selection. I choose this particular flat screen for the clarity and visual settings. Super simple setup with programming my particular entertainment selection. Very satisfied with the retail pricing of this particular model. So once again I'm super satisfied with the brand of electronics.,5
7/31/2023,"I wanted Zizio because of their participation with Dolby for HDR. I am by no means ""tech savvy"", but this feature, to me, was important, and I was vastly rewarded! This TV was purchased to replace a 15-yo TV, for my bedroom, which I knew would be used mostly for noise to sleep to. I have since moved it to my livingroom, because it's by far the best TV I've ever owned. Vizio is one to watch! They know what their consumers want!",5
7/17/2023,"perfect simple tv. you are able to customize the apps where you want them. there are short cuts for certain apps on the remote itself which is nice. those cannot be changed. it doesn't take forever to turn on. some smart TVs do. for the price, you cant beat it.",5
7/31/2023,"This  TV is a great value. The picture is clear and sharp. I found the remote to be very easy to use. Other reviewers commented negatively about using the remote. It was not an issue.  

Many apps are already loaded and ready for you to sign in. Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime video, YouTube, etc. There are also many other viewing selections.",5
10/22/2023,This TV arrived the next day after ordering! Fantastic customer service by Walmart. Set it up yesterday and it looks great. Had a little trouble creating the Vizio account but finally completed that and the setup was easy. So far very happy with this purchase.,5
6/26/2023,"this is the second Vizio TV I've purchased in the past 6 months, a 70"" for my living room and just recently a 50"" for my bedroom. Very pleased so far. picture and sound are very good, I've got a Vizio sound bar for both that makes it even better. simple to set up and use, only thing I wish it had was voice command like my old Roku TV had.",5
8/3/2023,"Easy set up. Crystal clear. I've owned Sonys, Samsungs, and LGs. After many moves from state to state and overseas, tv's breaking here and there, there was no point in spending thousands again and again. Vizio is by far the easiest to set up with a clarity and price point. Only down fall is the tv sound. A matching sound lane is an absolute must!",5
10/18/2023,This is my 2nd Vizio. My first one I had for around 12-15 years it still worked but the screen was losing its color. So I decided to replace it with this one. The price fit my budget.  The new technology and lighter weight is fantastic. The visuals are so crisp and vivid. The colors are bright and clear. I hope to have this tv for many years.,5
7/14/2023,"This is a pretty good TV with great sound!  I'm not incredibly picky with my A/V.  All I can tell you is that it has a great picture, user friendly, easy to set up, pretty light for its size, and has much better sound than our 55"" Roku TV. We've only had this TV for a week now, so I'll update this review if things go south.  For $400, I can't complain, so far.",5
9/24/2023,"I am totally in love with this purchase..it is absolutely beautiful on my bedroom wall and Vizo doesn’t disappoint! I had a 32 inch for years and it was still going strong but I wanted to treat myself to something new for my birthday and this checked all the boxes! Set up was easy, and customer support was great!",5
8/19/2023,I Love that I can find my streaming Apps right there on the home page.  I like that it has an awesome picture for gaming and Movies and TV Shows. I dislike that it leans forward after you attack the legs. It makes nervous that it might tip over if the fan blows on it.,5
7/8/2023,I love this TV.  My only complaint is that you can't remove apps from it. I was having a problem with an app and needed to uninstall and reinstall only to find out that isn't an option without doing a factory reset. That being said I would still purchase this TV.,5
7/22/2023,"This is a great TV at an awesome price- a 50 inch high quality brand for just 259 bucks, awesome.  A nice young man delivered the TV within an hour of me making the purchase. We chose to do the setup ourselves and it was very easy. I was very happy to see that it offered Bluetooth for my headphones as well as the older 3.5mm standard plug, so I can also use my older high end wired headphones, NICE.  You can download the 52 page users manual and view it online or print it, and it has multiple languages, with English being the front one,",5
10/17/2023,"I have been using this TV for a few months now and am 100% satisified.  I am not a movie buff or audiophile but this TV definitely satisifies my needs.  I have had no problem, fairly user friendly and the picture and sound are as good as I would hope.",5
9/23/2023,"Absolutely wonderful product, Good sound, Excellent graphics, Nice comfortable viewing size, Remote could use a redesign, Lite weight, I feel this was a very good buy for the price. I wish they would add a browser feature for direct internet access; That would work very well with the remote voice feature.",5
10/17/2023,"I've only had the tv for a couple of weeks, but so far i really like it. really clear and vibrant picture,  the sound is good and very easy set up process. great  price too. Love the whole layout of the apps...very easy and convient. would recommend.",5
8/25/2023,"Our previous Vizio lasted for 14 years of non-stop use and was a floor model in the store so when we were needing to replace it we definitely went looking for another Vizio! And we are not disappointed! Quick delivery (came 2 days early), arrived perfectly, much lighter than our old set and was super easy to hang on our previous tv's wall mount with only buying longer screws. The set up was simple along with pairing it to our dish service and we are very pleased with the crisp color, great sound and going from a 55"" to a 65"" how much bigger %26 brighter the picture is! We are extremely happy with the Vizio brand!",5
7/14/2023,"I think as hesitent to buy Vizio brand bc working for the cable company know this brand doesnt last long. there weren't a lot of options in this screen size so I want with it. At this price point I'll be surprised if it last 2 years, but it's going to guest bedroom   and won't be used much. It has a beautiful picture and setup was easy.",5
9/25/2023,"Got the 55” V-Series on sale at $298 and I have to say that this beats my $400 LG TV in every way except maybe the TV speakers. Even then, the speakers still sound great. The picture and sound quality are both great for movies and gaming. I wouldn't use the TV speakers to play music because the speakers aren't going to give you the performance you'd want for that but regardless, music still does sound decent.

Install was easy and setup was a breeze. The new software update makes the Home Screen look great. Good job Vizio!",5
10/5/2023,"Don't understand all of the negative comments. So far it's been a good purchase. If anything changes I will update you. Good price, nice picture, good sound, looks great on the wall. The Dallas Cowboys look great on it. I will update you if anything changes.",5
8/7/2023,"When you first turn it on the tv is in demo mode. After completing set up process the picture improves. Smart features are an asset. I can log into my youtube account! 👌
Combined with my ROKU and Directv I have endless channel options. 
I'm glad I opted for the 43"" (bedroom). Not too big yet large enough to enjoy. Picture and sound are very good… granted I use a soundbar and subwoofer.",5
7/12/2023,"So far, so AWESOME!!! I love that it's a Smart TV. It has more apps, then most, the price was right, and; it comes with Redbox App, which it definitely a huge benefit, via; most Smart TVs don't come with that app and free live TV (WITH MORE TV PROGRAM OPTIONS)....",5
10/5/2023,My sister just bought a house and I'm not one to get her basic gifts. I got her a blender and she was already so ecstatic about that. This can the day after and she was at a loss for words. She hasn't even opened the box and already she's soooooooo happy with it! :),5
8/21/2023,"Likes: Great picture clarity. Wide variety of choices without having to have cable. This smart tv let’s you watch channels without having to pay for expensive cable. You just need internet connection. Very simple to set up. 

Dislikes; that o didn’t get one sooner.",5
10/5/2023,I bought this tv in a 75 in for myself last year. I went to my parents house and their tv was so small I couldn't see over the wood burning stove so I bought them this tv in a 65in. Now they have a big tv in their living room everyone can see when they come to visit,5
7/8/2023,I am sooo happy with this tv!!!! Came on time %26 in perfectly great condition packed very safe. This was so easy to set up ! I am so not into technology at all so I was afraid to get a smart tv.  My son started up it took less than 8 minutes for all the scanning or searches and it automatically recognized our WiFi. I don't see great I wear glasses and being able to say Netflix or prime or Hulu is great. Didn't need to do anything for the voice remote to work. Only improvement would be for the remote to light up but that's not a big deal. The tv is so so nice for 317.00 with tax this 55 inch looks bigger than it is idk if it's bcuz it's in my room but everyone of my kids and grandson thought it was big and my grandsons room has a 70 inch ! ...,5
7/14/2023,"I like this TV. We had a bumpy start but not sure if it was new internet service or new TV but since all is good now, I give that a pass. The set up was easy enough after I realized my internet was tweaky. The HD picture is vibrant and sound is great too!! I hope it lasts for only $300",5
10/4/2023,"This is a two part review as the product itself was a great quality and we've been really happy upgrading to all Vizios in our home. I do want to say though that the Walmart employees who delivered it, they didn't just knock on the door and drop it. They walked it in the house and placed it in the living room and I send them out with a thank you tip and waters. Could not say how much I appreciated it being a mom at home by myself and having to consider getting that tv up the front steps. Big appreciate for going above and beyond.",5
9/15/2023,"The 65"" Smart TV from Vizio is a great item. The picture, speed of actions, price, and being lightweight (wall-mounted) are definitely a plus. My only concern is the smaller size of the remote. Yes, It is a bit slight and because of that it is actually a cumbersome remote to operate. 
The sound is good for a flat-screen TV, however, I ordered the Vizio surround sound system and the sound has intensified the listening enjoyment. I would recommend this product.",5
8/18/2023,"I know there are numerous tv brands to choose from that are equally good as the Vizio. However, I've bought and trust the Vizio brand for over 20 years. I have never encountered any issues. The features are fantastic. This tv purchase is actually replacing my older model 65"" Vizio that I've had for over 13 years. No issues with the older model. I'm actually paying it forward and giving it to a friend. She's overjoyed to receive it.",5
7/12/2023,"my tv died on the 4th of July weekend.. I ordered this tv the same night, and it was delivered the next morning for me. Excellent packaging, easy to unpack and assemble. No need for a second person. I did all by myself easy peasy. The picture is excellent, easy to set up, and easy to use remote....price is a steal. I highly recommended it.",5
3/29/2023,Love the interface of this TV! The only thing I was missing was how to add additional apps. Couldn't figure it out if it is an option. I ended up buying a Roku stick to add for my other network apps that aren't included. This is so much more user friendly than Samsung in my opinion.  Great color and clarity.,5
10/7/2023,"Love this TV. It loads up fast, has a bunch of apps already installed, including Chromecast, and you can customize it by adding other apps. The picture is great, and I really love the voice-activated remote control. I got this TV on sale for $398 and couldn't be happier with it.",5
9/15/2023,"Very vivid ..lightweight-easy to unbox and setup.
   ps5 games with hdr10 enabled look amazing. 
auto recognized and labels console and firetv. 
Bluetooth to 5.1 system audio has good timing NO delay or lag voice sync. didn't test builtin speakers too much.Seemed a bit flat 
Os kind of laggy vs firetv max.
Overall pleased. showing friend a 4k scene on you tube looked great",5
9/18/2023,Was wanting an inexpensive larger screen television. Looked at the Hisense and the Vizio.  Can't address the longevity since I just got it but the quality build and ease of setup put Vizio Head and Shoulders above the hisense. The Hisense legs were plastic that just attached on the outside of the back. The Vizio legs are metal and actually slide up inside the frame of the TV and attach.  To start the Vizio all I had to do was plug in the Amazon Fire stick it automatically connected with our Wi-Fi and within 60 seconds I was ready to watch. The Hisense Roku wanted me to set up a Roku account and jump to a lot of hoops before I could watch TV.  The picture on the Vizio is fantastic and for the extra $20 it was well worth getting the Vizio.,5
8/6/2023,"It’s a fine TV. Would be fantastic if it had 120Hz refresh rate, but can’t expect that on a TV at this price point. If you’re a casual TV watcher or like to do basic console gaming, this TV is a great choice. Price seems very reasonable. Picture clarity out of the box is great and the sound from the speakers seems fine. I’d recommend a matching sound bar for better quality audio if this will be your primary TV.",5
4/18/2023,Great picture and sound. You can talk to the remote. Love the size.,5
4/6/2023,Lightweight and easy set up. Quality for the price.,5
2/10/2024,"I like the picture its very clear. It downloads faster than my other 7 year old Vizio, almost twice as fast.",5
11/18/2023,"a very nice tv. a bit blurry with fast motion movie scenes, video game play, but no worse than any other 60 hertz",5
1/25/2024,I purchased this item at what appeared to be a sale. I am glad that I did. It fits the space perfectly. The picture quality is very good as well.,5
2/12/2024,I received my orders in a timely manner although it was temporarily delayed due to unforeseen circumstances. Customer service was polite and helpful,5
1/26/2024,the tv shows great color great sound i love everything about it it even has free channels my fav love this vizio television.,5
2/14/2024,This is a great tv. I purchased the bundle that came with speaker and sound bar. Great deal!! Vizios are my favorite TVs,5
2/5/2024,I liked getting the television delivered a day earlier and at 1pm instead of waiting for the next day for the delivery.,5
1/28/2024,"I liked how easy it was to order %26 track the tv, it came 2 days earlier than expected. It was packaged well.  And, easy to set up.",5
12/30/2023,I love everything about this tv,5
1/26/2024,Awesome TV for the price. Picture is clear and sound is good. I did hook up a sound bar but it's not a necessity.,5
1/31/2024,Easy set up better than I expected. Picture shows beautifully sound is excellent is enjoyable altogether.,5
2/16/2024,Packaging was great. Simple to set up. Much faster than my old model. Only problem has been I have to turn the volume up much more than my 32”,5

8/2/2023,"Have been using the TV for less than a month and have found it reliable, with excellent color and sound.  Great value at Walmart on this size/features.
Set-up was done with no problems by a tech person.",5
7/11/2023,This tv is excellent and I’m so glad I purchased it! It was the easiest setup ever. The picture quality is gorgeous and there’s so many features such as free channels and lots of them. It’s an amazing tv!,5
10/1/2023,This tv is awesome. I still haven’t tried out all of the different features as of yet but it’s definitely worth the price. The only problem was that it didn’t come with a remote control in the box and I had to contact Vizio to get one.,5
10/23/2023,"TV works great, though it is a bit weird to have a remote control with NO number buttons on it. Might eventually replace the remote with a different one.",5
8/12/2023,my other tv which was a 50 inch was about 5 yrs old the picture went white had volume but no picture so i bought this 55 inch which is a lot taller but its taking sometime to adjust. so far it us ok picture is more vivid.,5
9/26/2023,"The picture is AWESOME  !! The sound sucks  "" it's not really the volume it's the bass  , it's lousy  !!!   
I hooked up a sound bar and it's a whole different animal  ""  it went from a guinea  pig to a LION  !!!!",5
10/2/2023,"This replaced an earlier version 43"" model of the same maker, that the screen pixeled out after a misshap. A little long getting the updates installed. But it was a good choice as a replacement.",5
8/29/2023,The thing I love the most is the voice remote control that's a big plus. I wish I had more local news in the free watch. Everything else is great resolution is amazing.,5
9/5/2023,"Super easy set up, got my fire stick and computer working with the tv. Great price, picture and love that I can enter the channel number on my remote.",5
9/28/2023,"Beautiful picture, sound, easy to navigate and best of all it was on sale! My old plasma tv died and was roughly 12 years old. This tv was a nice upgrade and great price.",5
9/22/2023,So happy %26! extremely satisfied with my purchase. Money well spent...Tons of pre-installed apps to choose fron. Highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a 65' TV!,5
8/13/2023,"so far so good. easy setup. just a few upgrades in the beginning but after that, everything was a breeze. easy interface. simple remote. nothing fancy so we'll see if it lasts.",5
9/11/2023,The TV is great size. The sound isn't best quality but we ordered a sound system so we will see how that goes. It came quick and it was packaged well.,5
8/13/2023,"The set up was so simple. Great picture, I should get a sound bar for it. 
The two young men that brought the TV to my vehicle were so nice and helpful, hey would not even accept a tip after they loaded it into my vehicle.",5
7/18/2023,Love this TV— it works so well and looks even better than our old one. The color resolution is great and I love having a few free channel networks to watch where I don’t have to pay a subscription.,5
10/2/2023,Absolutely love it. This is the fifth Vizio flat screen purchased over the years (all still working) by our family(s) and they just keep getting better. Best bang for the buck!,5
10/19/2023,"This is my third Vizio to own over the course of the last 2 decades. Love this brand, have never had issues other than just needing to upgrade to larger sizes! Would recommend!",5
7/9/2023,"My son told me to choose 
this brand.  He's an engineer so I did.  This is the best way to go. The picture, sound and pixels are very good. It's a great 
value for the price!",5
9/20/2023,very easy app too navigate im loving the tv itself and props to the delivery guy for getting it on my porch in great shape and going the extra mile for tucking it behind my patio furniture,5
7/14/2023,Picture quality is great! We love it. We prefer the old school tv's because the new tvs have to be “set up” before you can turn it on to watch. Great price and is worth it overall.,5
9/5/2023,"Shipping was perfect, easy to set up,  we really like Vizio tv's.  Our last one was about12 yrs old and still in great condition. No issues.  We just wanted a bigger one.",5
10/8/2023,Amazing picture quality for the price. It was easy to attach to the mount and easy to set up. The tv runs smoothly over Wi-Fi. Picture quality is far better than my 4k ONN tv.,5
7/4/2023,Vizio is a great brand.  I have not used this tv yet as I am waiting for someone to set it up.  The delivery was fast and efficient.  She was also very kind and friendly.,5
7/21/2023,Love it! The picture quality is great and so are the features. I love that you can easily keep track of what devices are plugged in back to the HDMI ports and that they are all named-it's not a guessing game.,5
8/28/2023,"Menu system is very fast, the remote is pretty intuitive. The colors are very vivid, 4K looks excellent and for a 50-in TV it weighs nothing. Speakers could be better but that is the way it is with most TVs you have to buy a sound bar.",5
7/25/2023,"This tv was a perfect fit for over the fireplace in our den, we have another larger one over our mantle in the living room. Both Vizios have beautiful picture definition, sound and love all the apps it came with. Id definitely recommend to everyone.",5
8/15/2023,"I'd been searching for a budget-friendly TV. I did some research, and decided on this one. Such a beautiful, vibrant, sharp display! I recommend this TV 100%.",5
8/4/2023,I love the quality the picture is awesome. The interface is cool as well. I would say what I don't like about the TV would be it kicks off the voice command sometimes.,5
7/16/2023,"we love this tv,  it was easy to set up, and use.  Ilike there is a an app you can use in the event you misplace the remote.It has a very clear high definition picture.",5
10/22/2023,"We bought two of these. One 6 months ago for family room. Now a 2nd one for living room. It was recommended by Kurt the Cyber guy and cannot be beat for the price,",5
7/9/2023,Great TV for the price. We use it in the bedroom. The picture is great and the volume is good too. It’s very light so be careful if it’s at kids height. They can easily knock it down.,5
7/6/2023,"Amazing tv great picture %26 sound plus it was delivered same day I bought and they were very gentle with it
It was more than I wanted to spend but totally worth it",5
8/26/2023,"The sound is not loud enough you got to turn it up high on some movies, but the TV is great so far.  I've always had VIZIO TV, and I never had problems with them.",5
10/8/2023,Don’t need cable with this tv alls you need is internet and you can watch live tv and on demand. No subscription needed unless you want to subscribe to anything that’s not included.,5
7/16/2023,"I saw this Vizio listed on sale on the app and bought it. I replaced a 65 inch Philips. I am very happy with everything. The picture quality, and the app menu screen.",5
10/20/2023,We absolutely love this TV. We ordered on line with pick-up the same day. Everything went perfectly. Got the TV home and it’s a easy set ip. Color is great too. Would recommend this TV to anyone!,5
7/1/2023,"I liked the quick and prompt service and delverly I recieved. The delivery person also helped me locate my 55"" TV as it was too much for.me.to handle with my bad wrist. He was very courtesy in giving me.a hand.",5
10/3/2023,"Purchase this tv for my living room. At first, I thought it was too big to fix on the entertainment. But, my daughter and I were able to add the legs and it fits perfectly.",5
7/5/2023,I gave this TV 5 stars. The picture is so clear %26 the apps are easy to access. A big thanks to Walmart %26 Vizio for such good service %26 pricing. I highly recommend this TV.,5
7/28/2023,I love the sharp colors and clear picture. It was also easy to set up which is a plus. So glad I chose this TV.  Fast delivery is also great. I didn't have to worry about getting it in my car,5
7/18/2023,"I had a quick delivery with no damage to the box. This Vizio 50” LED smart TV is so much better than my last TV. 
In the “1950”s all tv’s had a round picture and were black and white pictures.",5
7/5/2023,"This was the first time I utilize the online service and I was quite impressed. Young lady that bought the television said she was very very nice and very very respectful. If I could, I put a recommendation in her folder. Thank you.",5
9/15/2023,The best and sharpest picture in a television that I have purchased.. the price of this television was incredible.. I've always wanted a Visio tv and very happy with the purchase.. would highly recommend,5
9/30/2023,"Bought this for our kids game/movie room. The price was right and picture quality top notch. No real complaints, navigating the built in apps is easy and intuitive.",5
8/24/2023,Purchased this TV when I was on sale for $350. I absolutely love. It was easy to hang on our wall. The color and clarity is great. I definitely got my moneys worth.,5
10/5/2023,"You can access all your favorite apps, has bluetooth for wireless headphones, easy to navigate. Works great with my directv. Plus, it has a tons of free programs!",5
7/5/2023,I did need help setting up the TV for an antenna.   Unfamiliar with the newer technology  and figuring out the remote was the biggest hold up.  Couldn't pass up the price.  It really is a very nice TV.,5
10/18/2023,This is a wonderful tv at such a good price.  We can see every thing and read what's going across the bottom of screen.  Great for senior's.  Glad we have it.,5
7/7/2023,"This was an amazing price on a real good tv. It replaced the Vizio we had, and the tv went kaput after a storm recently. But I know it was a great tv because it lasted 12 years. I trust Vizio.",5
5/18/2023,"The price was a plus. This Tv has a beautiful picture. Easy to set up, Had to use a table top TV mount. The TV is a 55 inch big screen. This company has been around for some time. I have also seen good reviews. I would recommend if you are in the market.",5
5/19/2023,Got this tv home and it was packaged very well. The feet were easy to put on and fit my tv stand beautifully. The setup was easy to understand and did a good job walking me through the basic settings. The picture has been wonderful so far with no issues! Only complaint is the smart tv menu design by Vizio could be more intuitive but it gets the job done. I use my phone as a remote and all my apps I use are favorited so I have real easy access to them. Overall this a great TV!,5
5/16/2023,So far so good with this TV (unlike my other Visio which likes to reboot randomly- sometimes multiple times in a row).  This TV is not one of the main TVs in the house- just something for workout videos in the basement gym. It's performing as expected for now (3 months in).,5
9/22/2021,Great Tv for the $$$,5
6/17/2023,"The Tv is completely fine, it's a big tv, I love it, I don't know why so many people have negative reviews about it, it was not damage, I like the screen, the volume is normal, everything about the tv is perfect, basically if you're not careful with it, of course it will crack, but mine came perfectly fine. I now own 2 visio tv, a 43 inches and a 65 inches. Don't hesitate to buy it, a 65 inches for $398, is more than enough.",5
7/17/2022,Excellent TV,5
11/14/2022,luv my tv,5
6/19/2023,Very satisfied with the service I received from Walmart on my recent purchase of a Vizio TV. It was delivered as promised as quickly as anyone could expect. Packaging was a good condition. It's now up on the wall working fine thank you Walmart good job.,5
5/24/2023,"I wanted a smart TV as we had oura for 12 years and I was tired of using a gaming system for streaming. This TV has all the apps you could imagine. I wish the quick buttons had better platforms, but the setup is great so I was able to organize them according to our preferences. 5/5",5
5/10/2023,So far so great. I was hopeful that delivery would be fine. it was. Im delighted with this purchase. I live the press and speak option on the remote saves you from scrolling for channels. just say find peacock and it brings up the channel. I no longer am squinting another plus. I did what another's review said and went into system and turned up the volume and now  I don't have to use a higher volume each time I watch something. It was less than a new x box my grandson just got. Crazy.,5
6/15/2023,"This is our 5th Vizio TV we have purchased over the years. The brand has outlasted all over brands we have purchased so we felt good about pulling the trigger. This TV has a good, picture on par with other lower-end 4K smart TVs. We love the 65"" size for the price of most 55"" models.  A bargain at the price they are selling at.",5
10/30/2023,My Sister and her boyfriend got me into the Vizio smart tv. I put the 50” into my bedroom with my dad and it fits perfectly in there. Now I’m getting ready to make money for another Vizio smart tv for my living room so that I can get a 65 or 70 inch screen that’ll be perfect for my living room and you will be notified when I’m ready to purchase the Vizio smart television,5
3/28/2023,"After carefully measuring the inset space in our RV, we ordered this shipped.  It was delivered next day directly from local store.  it was to high to fit in the hole, so installed moved the wall bracket and it fits great!  Unlike the Spectre tv, that only lasted 14 months (with no traveling), he said it was a good brand.  Even got a picture of where it was placed when delivery.",5
3/21/2022,Works amazing,5
5/9/2023,"It has only been a few days, but so far everything is great on this tv. We have had several Vizios they are always easy to set up and this one was no exception. Great picture, excellent price. Wish it had 4 HDMI slots like our last Vizio but I guess that's not common anymore, and at the low price point completely understandable.",5
5/10/2023,"I generally read the reviws before purchasing electronic equipment for insight as to any issues they might be having with the product. Since I already own 2 smart Vizio tv's ( 24"", 40"" ), and have only had one issue with the remote on the 40"" ( nothing to cry about, didn't need it anyway), I decided to go with it again on a 43"" smart tv with Bluetooth. Easy onscreen set up as with prior models. Only had it a short while, so time will tell.  For what its worth, gave the 24"" to a neighbor kid who didn't have one. He's excited and hopefully gets as much enjoyment out of it as I did ( bought on 1/2014 )...no issues!",5
6/13/2023,"Super nice TV. Easy to operate even for us old folks, picture is sharp and excellent. No complaints. Purchased it to replace my Hisense 43H4030f1 that we had about 4 years, then it went bad. No complaints with the Hisense Roku either. Tried the V Series over the D Series.",5
5/26/2023,Great quality for a very reasonable price. Easy setup and fairly easy to use the apps. I love utube tv app and I have cut the cable cord and stream all my local channels and have all of my favorite channels for a third of what I was paying. I also purchased a vizio for my bedroom and completely satisfied,5
6/6/2023,"I liked everything about my experience with ordering online and the delivery process. Everything that I read online about this 4k 65"" Vizio TV is true. My family is enjoying this experience. The color of the picture is awesome, and the sound quality is outstanding.",5
6/26/2022,Great tv,5
5/22/2023,This TV is the perfect size for a bedroom. The picture quality is amazing and top notch. The sound is super loud though so I keep it lower. My family loves Vizios and its all weve had. This is the best quality TV weve had by far! The price was amazing too. We will be getting the V series from now on.,5
5/30/2023,"My mom moved in with us and the room she's in doesn't have a cable jack so we needed a smart tv for her to watch shows..Vizio is a trusted brand in our house and this was SO easy to set up, picture quality is great and size is well worth the price point. I'd buy again",5
6/24/2023,Clear picture quality. Very satisfied with the deal I got on this Vizio smart tv. I found this cheaper on walmart.com than Amazon and that is really saying something. I wasn't expecting the quality to be as good for this price. I highly recommend this tv.,5
5/15/2023,"i actually fell in love with mine while researching. Within 1 week/less, I truly found more %26 more unexpected yet exciting benefits
 Unless you can just drop a couple of thousand on a tv, purchase a different brand. Oh. Very likely more complicated to se5up. At my home, we love ours more %26 more.",5
5/14/2023,"Walmart’s price was great, and the delivery was right on time!  My only negative is with Vizio, not Walmart.  I’m old-school and rely on manuals and schematics.  Setting this up was difficult as it is NOT just attach cables, and it’s ready to go.  No explanation of how to get TV channels after the screen tells you that you have no signal.  Online chat walked me through how to get to “add more channels” to get anything to appear!  Honestly, VIZIO, change me $10 more and include a set-up guide with pictures!",5
2/9/2024,"Everything 
Vizio is a good brand. All my TVs are Vizios",5

7/23/2022,"I wasn't sure I should purchase this VIZIO, but I am so glad I did. The color, the audio, and the size are perfect for me. The price was my original drawback as I wondered how good was it at that low cost? Well, folks, it exceeds my expectations. I love Walmart for bargains and products...",5
6/24/2021,I thought the sound was bad but found an adjustment in audio settings that made that better. Still a little tinny and the screen tends to be darker than the others in the house and I have tried everything to lighten it up. Thats the reason for only four stars. The support staff is good and easy to get in touch with.,5
11/2/2023,I love this TV and find it very user friendly. This is my third one and even the first one I purchased in 2018 is still working great.,5

12/8/2023,"Tv is very good. Easy to use, easy to hook up. Colors are very nice and sharp. The price was great.",5
2/12/2024,Disappointed. I ordered this online because my store was out of this color. Very disappointed t receive this and see the handle is a much lighter shade than the tumbler. I'll still use it but not happy with the color difference,1
12/5/2023,"Given the increasing cost of everyday items such as groceries, you can imagine how frustrated I am to once again receive expired food in my pickup order. The food expired a full month ago. Not only is that a waste of my money, it is also unsafe given that it is dairy. Almost one full month. I placed my order on December 4, 2023 and received cottage cheese that is stamped “best by November 6, 2023”.",1
9/3/2023,"DAMAGED. Supposed to have a handle. It is not there-broken off. If it won't hold up to shipping it won't hold up to the amount of use I will give it. I ordered a lavender 40 oz tumbler because I drink A LOT of water and need something to hold a lot of water in my van AND be easy to handle. I thought WITH a handle this would be ideal. But seeing the poor design of how the handle would have attached, I don't think so. 
AND thought the color would be more like the Ozark 20 oz tumbler I have. I like it but it is not large enough. But without a handle it would be tough to use a 40 oz tumbler while driving.",1
2/8/2024,Deliverer did not use notes for entry code of the building so did not deliver my package.  Instead returned it to the store. This is very upsetting.,1
12/22/2023,I'm upset that I can't use my tumbler because wrong straw sent with it. It wouldn't be so bad if I had an extra taller straw at home to use. Other than that the cup is beautiful!,1
10/22/2023,What idiot came up with this design???  A SCREW IN LID???  A lid that does NOT line up for easy drinking???  It lines up just off the handle which is quite possibly the most clumsy position for the straw!!!,1
7/18/2023,I ordered this Tumbler and chose curbside service… The associate brought me a Tumbler with no handles. Handle was completely broken off and raw metal connection points exposed. Will be returning.,1
3/20/2023,"came scuffed up, if i was good at returns id exhange it , but the shipping on this was already delayed to begin with, and dont feel like dealing with returns.",1
11/13/2023,When I got it via pick up it was cracked and I didn't notice until I got home and got it out of the bag to wash it.,1
1/7/2024,I received my cup broken!,1
10/3/2023,This product was sent with a bent part in the metal on the bottom of the cup. Didn't realize it until after the first week. Picture attached.,1
8/29/2023,Product shown with straw but was not delivered with a straw. I will return item when I am able to go out.,1
4/19/2023,I have ordered 2 of these to be shipped to me. They have both come extremely dinged up and chipped and to top it off the second one has no straw! And Walmart is making me go in twice to return them. its so ridiculous and inconvenient.,1
11/11/2023,Lid was broken when I received,1
3/15/2023,"Arrived scratched, Walmart made it right but it doesn’t hold ice long at all like other Ozark I’ve used. Put ice in around 10 pm and by 5 am all ice had melted. Super disappointing since other Ozark tumblers I’ve used held ice for days! The lavender color is very pretty!",1
4/5/2023,"These cups are great however, the shipping is leaves a lot to be desired. I ordered two cups and there was nothing separating them in the box. They are both scratched on the stainless part and One has a scratch in the paint. It’s not like I can return it for a non damaged one because these are sold out everywhere. This was for a gift and I’m bummed.",1
10/21/2023,The Tumblr come with no straw and two dent in the side.,1
8/13/2023,Arrived broken.  Piece chipped off and had to be when packaged as broken piece was not in the box.,1
6/6/2023,"The Cupid broken, when I looked on the camera the delivery person did not place it he dropped it on the ground",1
5/27/2023,"Received with a broken straw and black marks that could not be removed even when I washed it, marks  looks worse In person then in photo",1
11/1/2023,The top of the tumbler cup was covered in dust. The tumbler was scratched toward the bottom and the paint was scrubbed off. There were little spots on the tumbler. Did not bring it back because I am at home ill. But I am very disappointed that this cup was picked for me or that it would be sent to any customer in this condition .,1
1/11/2024,"So it says it's 40oz but it only holds 1 20oz water bottle and less than half of another water bottle. So I would like 26 oz maybe.  If I could return it, I would.  Also, it doesn't keep my water cold, ice melts fairly quickly.",1
1/22/2024,Order took longer than it should have. The straw was not included as described. If I use a regular straw it's much too short. Highly aggravated. I need the straw that comes with the tumbler,1
9/22/2023,"This cup did not last 2 months and the ice did not last the night. I went back to my cheaper cup. The lid had a very high lip around the perimeter, and the 2 areas that the opening stopped after screwed on were not in easy access to the handle. I threw this cup away. i recommend not buying.",1
10/14/2023,"I was so excited to receive this item then so let down when it didn't keep my ice til even lunchtime. I had to keep refilling it with ice multiple times throughout the day which is not something I have the ability to do, so, sadly, this cup sits on the shelf at home not being used.",1
8/7/2023,I purchased 3 of these cups mid April back when they were $15. 3 mth later These cups no longer keep drinks cold at all. The ice melts within hr or so. I'm not sure I shld be disappointed seeing I only paid $15 but every penny counts now days. I was a big fan of ozark cups %26 they were my go to when the yeti came out but I will just have to spend the extra $20 %26 purchase the name brand. Happy I wanted to do a review so I cld give a honest feedback.,1
3/30/2023,"Terrible at keeping ice! The only thing this cup has going for it is the appearance (at least the rainbow cup). I’ve been wanting an affordable tumbler that is stainless steel and can fit in my cup holder in my truck. I saw this on someone’s Instagram and picked up three of these cups. I put ice to the TOP and add cold water, the ice is melted only a few hours later. Don’t waste your money on these like I did, I am returning the other 2 cups that still have tags and will use that money for a more expensive brand that can actually keep drinks cold.",1
8/19/2023,"Poorly made, I bought two and the handle came off of both of them with minimal use, one while holding it. After screwing the handle back on twice and it falling apart again, I shoved them on a closet in disappointment and haven't touched them since. I had high hopes of using these while traveling this summer,",1
11/24/2023,"I didn't like the screw on top makes it very difficult to keep a straw, and when you put ice in the mug, I gave it away to my granddaughter she was thrilled to have it",1
11/19/2023,Ordered for my pregnant wife bc she was asked to up her water in take by her OB. It's pictured with a straw but didn't come with one. I picked one with a straw so it would be easier for her if she was reclined or laying down resting.,1
12/7/2023,the old style i had the ice lasted over a day. i only got this one because i loved the purple color. this does not hold the ice well at ALL!!! size/ ounce is nice. color is stylish. crappy insulation...or lack there of,1
12/14/2023,These would have been great tumblers had the correct straws been with them.  I ended up having to return them back to the store and order online to get the correct straws.,1
12/22/2023,It's sad that with Walmart they guarantee you a delivery and then send you a notification. It'll be three or four more days late from when they say when they say overnight. They don't mean overnight. They mean in three or four days,1
12/26/2023,"My 40-ounce Ozark Trail cup is not keeping ice in my drink or my drink cold for even 12 hours. I am really disappointed, as I have some of the 32-ounce tumblers that work great.",1
3/25/2023,"Wanted to love it, but the lid arrived with a huge chunk missing out of it. This had to have happened before it was packed because the missing chunk wasn't in the box and the box arrived with no damage.",1
1/16/2024,mug came and is missing the straw. how can this be missed? no stores near me even carry the navy to exchange. ridiculous,1
1/18/2024,Didn't look like the picture. Received a dirty white tumbler with a broken clear/white straw instead of black.,1
1/8/2024,I was disappointed by this Ozark Trail product. The handle came off my tumbler in less than 2 weeks after purchase.,1
8/22/2023,"Had less than month and the handle broke, it was loosened quickly after getting. original one I had got water inside and couldn't get it out. Not a fan.",1
10/13/2023,"great tumbler,  ice kept water cold well over 24 hrs .  after i had opened the package i noticed a dent about the size of a quarter on the side of it.",1
9/30/2023,"The tumbler arrived damaged, and was purchased for a gift. The tumbler was not wrapped in any type of packaging to keep it from getting damaged during delivery.",1
8/27/2023,"the handle broke after a week. never used it in the dishwasher. loved the cup. so cute. heavy weight and seemed good , unles i was holding it and the whole thing snapped right off",1
7/29/2023,I have purchased 3 of these because they fit in my car and all three have been defective. The first arrived with a cracked lid. The second a dent on the side and the third without a straw. Walmart needs to get it together.,1
7/10/2023,The cup was shipped to me and did not come with a straw. Called customer service and they said they would mail me a straw and the straw never came. The lid is also hard to get on and off.,1
9/4/2023,I love this cup but after having it a little over a month the handle has come unattached from the cup at the top. Making the handle useless and the cup inconvenient without the handle.,1
4/11/2023,"Sweats and doesnt stay cold as long as other tumblers.  I usually like the Ozarka tumblers, but this one is way off my expectations.  It does not hold ice as well as the others and the cup sweats. I was going to use it with epoxy to decorate it but I can't because of the condensation.",1
6/25/2023,Loved this cup at  first but shortly after buying and using it I realized how tough it was to open. This resulted in the handle breaking off while attempting to open it to fill it up. However it kept my water cold and the straw itself was really nice.,1
4/10/2023,"I really wanted to like this. Not only did walmart mess up my order multiple times causing me to have to cancel and reorder TWICE, but when it finally did arrive the bottom had such big dents that it wouldn't even stand up on it's own. I carried it around from 6pm to 11pm ONE day and the color is already worn off on every edge and groove. It's like the color coat is chalky and just rubs off with barely and friction. I really wanted this to be a decent cheap alternative to the Stanley tumblers.",1
2/15/2024,"it was returned bc i received a used tumbler! gross! 
i can't give 0 stars",1
2/12/2024,The item was delivered at the wrong address,1
2/16/2024,returned to store straw was not in cup,1
1/26/2024,The cup started falling apart straight out the box,1
2/14/2024,I ordered two cups and only got one,1
2/22/2024,Will not buy again . Straw is half plastic half rubber,1
1/29/2024,arrived with a dent in it and several black fingerprint smudges.,1
2/13/2024,tips over to easy...doesn't keep anytime cold,1
1/27/2024,Still waiting for delivery...shipping is terrible!,1
1/31/2024,i can't review something that i never received but was Charged for it,1
4/6/2023,"After reading reviews I thought we’d give this Ozark tumbler a try for our 11yo daughter. After washing it and filling with ice/water, I started screwing on the lid while holding what appeared to be a sturdy handle. It loosened up right away and then fell completely off side of cup. Super disappointing bc the rest of tumbler looks great. Ozark def needs to figure out a better way to attaching the handle to the cup especially for how large the cup is. Do t waste your time just go with a Stanley or Yeti and skip the hassle.",1
11/11/2023,it was never delivered to me but to someone else so someone got a free cup if i could give 0 stars i would,1
11/24/2023,The cup only lasted 30 days before the handle fell off and the straw had complications. Should have just bought a Stanley.,1
12/17/2023,"The cup arrived not in the original packaging, I know this because I have ordered multiple and they come in a box. The cup is all scratched up.",1
12/1/2023,i was very disappointed in the straw. instead of putting a linger straw in the cup they added a rubber piece to the straw.,1
11/27/2023,When I picked it up it is dented on the side and the handle is loose. I now have to return it and buy another one.,1
12/12/2023,i DISLIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT WAL-FARTS DELIVERYS AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS VERY BAD AND RUDE!!!!!!  :-((,1
7/31/2023,I love my cup but my cup is discolored. Looks dirty. I have washed by hand. Very disappointed.,1
1/4/2024,Missing lid and straw from container.,1
12/28/2023,my order was delivered to another house,1
1/6/2024,horrible the cup sweats and nothing stays cold,1
1/11/2024,Love the color but the cup itself didn't stay cold for more than an hour,1
12/29/2023,Cup came scratched and dented.,1
1/19/2024,Cup was extremely scratched up dented up when received.,1
1/3/2024,my cup had a dent in the bottom so it doesn't sut flat and the handle was loose.,1
1/9/2024,It doesn't keep your ice cold!,1
3/10/2023,Does not even keep ice in it for 2 hours. Have lots of ozark cups I love but this one is not what it claims,1
7/24/2023,The bottle always was difficult to open but now it unusable you can't even open it to use it don't buy,1
9/20/2023,"The handle falls off, you screw it back on, it falls off again. This need a better handle, mines in the trash.",1
8/8/2023,"The handle broke off within a few days of owning this, and it never once went through the dishwasher I hand washed it every time",1
8/21/2023,It was missing a straw. Now if I want to return it I have to bring it into the store. I got it through grocery pick up.,1
8/24/2023,Ordered online and the handle was broken off.  Can't speak to how cold or hot it keeps things as I didn't keep it.,1
7/23/2023,Ordered to pick up at the store and it was delivered to me already broke the lid. I returned immediately.,1
7/9/2023,The handle broke off within a couple weeks :( so sad it's a perfect “dupe” to the Stanley- wish it would t have broken so easily!,1
8/7/2023,"I loved the cup, but within the first two weeks the handle came off causing me to drop it and then the top cracked so now it's not usable.",1
7/20/2023,"The cups itself is fantastic, however obviously the straw was missing so the straw that was out into the cup is definitely the worst.",1
10/12/2023,Don't recommend this cop at all It's top heavy falls over the straw gets moldy with simple ice water after having it in the cup for 2 days,1
4/7/2023,Terrible quality.  The handle broke off within 24 hours of owning it.  I was simply holding the handle while unscrewing the lid... and it broke right off.  So frustrating and disappointing.  I do not recommend,1
4/15/2023,My handle broke off at one week !!!!! I could tell it wasn’t sturdy abets time I was holding it while twisting the cap ! Pretty colors - I got the gradient one. Walmart refunded me but now I have handle-less Lol,1
5/8/2023,"I loved the cup, however, the handle is weak.  The handle was the deciding factor for this purchase.  If the handle is important to you take this into consideration.",1

4/19/2023,Arrived with broken handle,1
6/25/2023,Handle is plastic and moves back and forth. Not sturdy. Received with a large dent in the bottom,1
5/23/2023,Like the cup but the lid is really hard to get off and on.,1
5/12/2023,It doesn't keep my drink cold for that long,1
5/27/2023,The handle is broken and I want my money back. What do I need to do ??,1
5/11/2023,The top is so hard to twist to open and close,1
5/14/2023,The handle broke within two hours of having it,1
6/22/2023,It does not keep ice very cold. Plus the lid is the hardest thing to get on and off.,1
4/14/2023,Handle broke off while I was carrying it up the stairs after having it for 3 days.,1
6/27/2023,Ice melted almost immediately,1
5/14/2023,It's nice and big but it came with a dent in the bottom of it.,1
6/26/2023,This cup arrived with scratches and does not keep ice.,1
6/27/2023,"Handle is loose, will not last long.",1
6/30/2023,it doesn't keep ice at all,1
5/26/2023,Broke after 2 weeks. Finally just bought the real Stanley,1
1/4/2024,"I tested this cup in the house with the air conditioning against my other cups..yeti, stanley, RTIC and an Amazon special. My ice was completely water within two hours in this cup. It's lightweight and inexpensive, but if you want something to keep your drink cold for longer than a couple of hours at most, this isn't the one.",1
1/23/2024,"The cup leaks.  I set the cup in my passenger seat as I was preparing to crank up my car and hit it by accident.  The cup fell over on its side and I saw it was leaking from the top.  I picked it up and checked the straw and lid (it was screwed in correctly) and when I turned it sideways and upside down, water was gushing out.   i am looking for a contact number to replace as I am hoping the one I purchased was defective.",1
1/17/2024,"I typically love this brand. the cup itself is great.  it insulates well. However, the handle weld broke within just a few uses. I replaced it with the Tag brand.  The design of the handle is much more stable and for nearly the same price as this one.",1
1/8/2024,"Cup was great for the first few months, but after everyday use as my tumbler I picked it up off the table and the handle came off !!!! The cup was not dropped or damaged prior to this so beware!",1
9/10/2023,"Behave this tumbler for 3 weeks, I hate it.  Since the 2nd use the lid has not fit properly. It's always been hand washed, I never dropped it, nothing. As the days went by, Lis became impossible to get off, handle is half falling off and NOW the lid is completely stuck on. I am a very fit person, so is my husband, neither of us can get the lid of. Total waste, now I have to buy a new Tumbler. Should have just spent the $45 on a quality mug instead of the Walmart rip off.",1
10/9/2023,"I was loving this. It keeps things cold just as well as my Yeti and the screw on top is easy. Since it's 40 ounces, I can take it in the car and have cold water all day.

Unfortunately, in under two months of use, I just picked it up and the handle snapped off….leaving me with the handle in my hand and my tumbler rolling around on the floor.
It's too big for me to carry without a handle, so it's useless now.",1
7/22/2023,I loved this cup at first. Less expensive than the Stanley cup but it's definitely not the same quality. The handle on my cup broke off while I was twisting off the lid. The cup is useless now. I don't have the receipt or the label so I can't return it.,1
4/7/2023,Don't buy. Handle broke off in less than 3 days. Super disappointed,1
1/31/2024,While this item was great.. it did not last long.. the handle fell off at the bottom after 6 months of moderate use..,1
11/5/2023,Literally every single time I go to refill this cup it takes me at least 15 minutes to open it. I am going to be buying another brand and throwing this one away.,1
10/30/2023,"The lid got stuck and would not come off, three days after I bought it. We had to throw it out because no matter what we did the lid wouldnt come off. Waste of money.",1
11/19/2023,"Bought 3 of these,  two for me and one for my sons girlfriend... the handle snapped off on BOTH of mine... not a bargain when they fall apart... very disappointed...",1
9/19/2023,I've had other Ozark Trail tumblers and this one does not hold up to those! This one doesn't hold ice like the others I have and once the ice is melted my water stay cold much longer.,1
8/16/2023,The tumbler is very nice and holds ice all day.  My only complaint is the straw.  It is soft and feels funny when I use it.  I've tried to find a replacement but none of them fit and seals completely.,1
7/28/2023,Not happy with handle! It felt loose and you can't tighten it. Only had it a few weeks and the handle snapped off. Not happy. Walmart would not exchange it.,1
10/16/2023,"My handle only lasted about 30 days before it completely broke off, the plastic tip on the straw, splits and breaks. I loved using it until these things broke.",1
7/18/2023,Paid cash. Tossed receipt. Got home and found that someone at the store had dropped it. Small dent in the bottom but enough that it wobbles badly. Very fragile. Not what i would call durable.,1
9/26/2023,I only used it for water and found a scratch inside the cup. Got a refund and ordered another purple one. It had the same scratch inside it. Returned it as well. So the scratch is from the manufacturing process. Sad because I really liked it.,1
7/28/2023,Overpriced $20 is too much $15 is the right price for this especially with the handle that always breaks. Inflation is supposedly going down but this went up….,1
4/24/2023,I was really looking forward to this cup.  Figured it would be a cheap alternative to the $50 Stanley ones.   I do find the handle to be sturdy and makes it easy to carry around.   First negative is the tumbler already has a scratch on it and I've only used it 2-4 times and handwash it only.   Biggest thing I am disappointed with is it doesn't hold the ice for that long.   I had a 32 oz ozark trail and it would literally keep ice in it and cold til next day.   This one melts in a few hours.   So although it did save me money initially.  Wish I wouldn't have got it!,1
2/4/2024,Lid was broken when I received it. Ended up returning it.,1
2/13/2024,It came broken and with the straw missing.,1
1/30/2024,Handle literally fell off while carrying it.  I didn't drop or break.  Wouldn't suggest.,1
11/8/2023,Returned because the bottom 3/4 of the straw is hard plastic and the top 1/4 is flexible rubber. Very strange.,1
11/28/2023,Lid broke and they don't sell replacement lids! My favorite cup and can't use anymore because they don't see just the lid.,1
1/9/2024,Handle broke after 2nd use!,1
1/10/2024,I never received this item. It was canceled. Have a 1 because I had to give a rating.,1
1/10/2024,These were shipped 3 to a huge box with no packing arrived damged.,1
10/3/2023,The cup fell off my porch and ended up with a HUGE dent in the side of it. None of my other name brand cups are very did that.,1
6/6/2023,I bought this is the store and had this cup for 1 week and the handle broke and when I went to return the very rude  employee and manager were  really rude and said they can't take it back because it had a lot of “wear and tear”. Don't buy this !!!,1
12/12/2023,the handle fell off 2 days after purchase!,1
11/24/2023,My handle broke off after only a couple months,1
11/18/2023,the cup does not stand without being wobbaly the bottom boes out,1
12/11/2023,had it one day and it dent on the bottom and now it wont sit still when you set it down.,1
10/30/2023,the handle unwelded after a few months.,1
11/27/2023,Paint is peeling off from the top making it pretty ugly,1
11/28/2023,Handle broke off after 3 uses!,1
9/28/2023,handle fell off within a month,1
10/20/2023,Handle broke after a few months of use,1
8/28/2023,nice but they lied about it being spill proof,1
9/22/2023,Doesn't keep anything cold for long sadly.,1
8/3/2023,i like the handle on it but i hate that the ice doesn't last long at all.,1
9/12/2023,handle fell off within two weeks,1
9/2/2023,Had to return both cups we bought because the handles broke on both of them. Poor quality.,1
10/4/2023,Loved it until the handle broke off.,1
6/27/2023,It only lasted a few weeks and I just came back to buy another and the price increased $6 in 4 weeks!! Not worth it for this cheap junk.,1
6/14/2023,Ice melts in less then 3 hours. The label says up to 25 hours but does not even come close. Dont waste your money.,1
3/11/2023,"I bought this cup last night at my local Walmart and love it at first. In less than 12 hours of purchase, the top attachment came loose and I can't get it to reconnect. You can use the handle on the cup at all.",1
4/11/2023,This is the worst insulated cup I have ever owned.    The ice will not keep in this cup longer than 3/4 hrs.    Guess you get what you pay for but total waste of money!,1
6/19/2023,"these do not hold ice at all. melted in a short period of time, does not last all day.",1
4/16/2023,the handle is cheap and broke within the first 2 days of use,1
3/22/2023,Why advertise these when they’re none available??,1
3/28/2023,I was so excited for this cup mainly because I can’t afford the “Stanley” one but also this brand has never failed me In the past it always kept my drinks cold for a long period which this does but unfortunately I wanted the handle and fit in my car cup holder which it did but in less than a week of using it the handle snapped where it’s welded prior to it snapping when I first got it the handle always felt slightly loose and wiggly. I’m so sad I really was bragging about how I love this cup:( till this!,2
11/27/2023,"Not a bad cup. I'm not one to use ice, so I'm not sure how insulated it really is. The straw is interesting? And the lid is a bit irritating to get off sometimes, but my yeti is the same way. My main problem is it's supposed to be dishwasher safe. This is only the 2nd time it's been in the dishwasher... ???",2
8/30/2023,"I have ordered this white tumbler twice now and each time it has either been dented or have marks on it which won't scrub off. I don't know if the tumbler was like this before it's placed in the box or if it happened during shipping but if it was just placed in there like this can we get some kind of quality check with our orders?  (I've included a pic, this was after me trying to scrub it clean.)
I'm frustrated because I was hoping to have this for my niece's birthday, but I can't give her a damaged gift.",2
4/6/2023,"For the price, this cup is great! However, I’ve had it about a week and with normal usage, the finish is already chipping off the bottom. I believe this is from simply putting it in the cup holder in my car.",2
3/2/2023,This cup was the perfect size and color. The top of the handle was missing the clip to keep it attached to the cup. This could not have been a shipping issue and was most definitely a manufacturing issue. The cup would've been perfect if not for it being broken and unusable. I have other cups from this brand that perform excellent.,2
10/11/2023,The cup is great all around but within 2 weeks the handle broke off.. :(,2
2/9/2024,"I always have a basic CLEAR chapstick on, but from literally day 1 of using this cup it's stained the silicone straw. It's ridiculous. I regularly wash this cup because I have a rotation of cups I use. There's only ever just plain water in it. No flavored waters. No soda, juice, tea, NOTHING but water. That's it. Why on earth would this straw look so dingy the first day? Especially when it's regularly washed and kept clean and only has water in it?",2
1/15/2024,"This tumbler kept water cold all day, the straw is flexible on top but rigid inside the tumbler, and it feels sturdy. Unfortunately the rubberized coating on the outside became completely tacky and sticky to the touch due to the label/display stickers. Nothing we tried could take the stickiness away, so it's useless now.",2
1/16/2024,"I saw the good reviews on this and thought I would give it a try.   I think I got a dud.  I had high hopes because I have the name brand crazy cup and it holds ice for 48 hours.  With how crazy everyone is being over them I thought this would be a great alternative.  I chilled my cup first and then added a huge chunk of ice to it.   The ice didn't even last 12 hours.   With my “crazy” brand cup, I get 36-48 hours usually.   It was worth a shot, but didn't work for me.  I gave it away.",2
12/11/2023,"I'm pretty upset with this cup, I ordered this for work purposes so that I could drink water. And have a cup that was 40 ounces to have in my car that fit in my cupholder. Of course that will happen, however, I ordered this online and got same-day shipping, it was delivered quickly, but it was delivered without a straw, so I have no straw for this Tumblr.",2
11/27/2023,"Great cup and great sale price.  However, I didn't realize Walmart was going to charge me a $6 under price fee and $25 shipping fee.  I didn't see the fees until I submitted payment and got payment confirmation email.  I would have been better off paying full price at the store.",2
10/31/2023,"I noticed this cup doesn't keep ice near as long as another Stanley dupe that I have. I have another off brand and after putting ice in it and leaving it in my car, it still had ice the next morning. With this cup, the ice is melted within a few hours and it's been inside at my desk.",2
10/20/2023,These were great at first! I liked them so much I bought 3. Now less than 3 months of use and 2 out of the 3s handles have broken. They are too large to not have a working handle so they are useless now.,2
1/23/2024,"it nice looking pretty tall 
when i received it the straw has slits around it wont beable to use so im get nna have to find a real long reuseable straw",2
1/25/2024,"Too big n bulky. Wanted something bigger for car trips. Too big 4 a Senior 2 be lugging around. Yes, I'm 60! I have a 25 oz. one %26 it won't even fit in the cup holder, like it's suppose too? The handle is awkward too...",2
1/19/2024,"The cups works well for keeping ice and drinks cold, but the handle came loose after a day of use. My husband tightened it, but it just comes loose again.",2
9/24/2023,"Holds ice long over a day. Overall I like the cup, but there are a few disappointments. 1. The cup leaks extremely easily. You just tip the cup ever so slightly, and water is pouring out all over everything. 2. The handle wont tightened. Kinda like someone or something stripped the screws.",2
8/27/2023,"my tumbler arrived in the mail with a shattered lid, in three pieces! This color is out of stock at stores within 50 miles of my house that is why I ordered it for shipping. so, I called customer service, and they gave me a $5.00 off my next purchase of $10.00 or more! I ordered a replacement lid from Amazon  however it does not fit it is to small, also the lid from my Stanley does not fit it either ! I love the color of the cup i wish I had the lid!",2
9/18/2023,"I have no idea about the quality or the function of the cup…the colors are vibrant and it's a great dupe for you-know-who….however, it was “packed” with some ladies boots…very loosely packed…and arrived dented. Had to return. I've ordered a replacement however-the cup is lovely!",2
9/26/2023,Been wanting them to add a handle but of course they went SUPER cheap %26 Chinese on the handle %26 cup. 2 handles broke already in less than 3 weeks. Should have molded the handle into the metal with metal.2 cheap screws into plastic is a joke. Great potential but this model fell short. The old 40 oz is still the best.,2
8/23/2023,"I love the size of the cup and the fact that it fits my cup holder in my car; however, mine does not keep ice at all. The ice even melts within 1 hour inside of an air conditioned home. I have owned the Yeti version Ozark cups and they hold ice well, BUT NOT THIS ONE!",2
2/13/2024,handle came undone and not able to fix it and had to throw it away. Otherwise I loved the mug and was Fairy disappointed when I had to throw it away,2
10/28/2023,"There is a dent in the bottom which causes it not to be level when sitting on a table
The straw also didn't come with the extender so it was too short to even use",2
11/3/2023,"Ice melts in a few hours,watering down drink badly.Very disappointed. Spend the extra money for a  name brand.This was a waste of money.I do not recommend.",2
12/3/2023,I find that this cup does not keep ice as long as it should. Mine ends up melted within an hour. Kind of disappointed that it doesn't work that well for $20.,2
4/17/2023,After one day of use my straw topper is already ripping I was super excited about this cup! Attempting to cash in the lifetime warranty but already having issues,2
1/19/2024,Ordered this online. The color is beautiful. However to bottom of the cup is dented and wobbles when I set it downdy. Sending it back.,2
1/16/2024,"Cup is great, lid is terrible.  Lid is hard to get started and straw does not line up towards front for right hand user",2
7/31/2023,The cup worked great for about a month.  Then the top part of the handle snapped. The bottom part is still connected however its lost all functionality.  Very disappointing.,2
9/17/2023,It was gift for someone and they told me that the handle broke off without even dropping it. I took a look at it and it looks like it was just poorly glued on.,2
10/8/2023,Should've believed the reviews I saw about the handle falling off! Super disappointing when you buy a tumbler with a handle and within 3 weeks there's just an ugly patch of unpainted metal where the handle used to be.,2
10/23/2023,"I bought this as a cheap Stanley replica but its nowhere near a Stanley. This leaks with the lid on, I stopped using this because of how often it would leak and spill in my bag. Spend the money to get something better.",2
6/16/2023,"Although I loveeeee the look of this tumbler, it doesn't keep drinks as cold as others. I have the purple Ozark trail one and it's great. Rec'd this one, filled it with extra ice this morning to make sure I wasn't crazy and sure enough, it's already melted by noon.",2
5/7/2023,"Handle was loose when I picked it up, but I liked the price point. It went through the dishwasher exactly one time before the handle came off completely. Crappy design! Other than that, the cup does what it's supposed to I guess. I prefer my Simple Modern Trek cup.",2
2/14/2024,Should come with a straw.,2
1/26/2024,doesnt keep water cold and leaks at the top,2
2/11/2024,"It does not keep my water cold for 12 hours, maybe 2 hours cold.",2
2/9/2024,I love the color but the cup is too heavy and bulky to use.,2
2/15/2024,"pick up order, they picked one without a straw",2
11/13/2023,My package was left out by the garage instead of at the front door! I'm glad I was home to get it right away! Not a good thing!,2
1/6/2024,more burnt brown not red photo deceiving,2
1/25/2024,Ice starts melting almost immediately,2
1/19/2024,definitely NOT spill proof!,2
1/6/2024,"My cup came with a white, rubber straw. Will be returning for false advertisement",2
7/14/2023,Love the size of it. The handle was extremely wobbly and ended up breaking not even after a week of use…,2
8/27/2023,It's good for a little while and then the handle breaks off. Doesn't hold ice well after a few weeks either.,2
7/12/2023,"Poor quality. I only handwashed the tumbler, and the handle fell off after 3 weeks of normal daily use.",2
7/17/2023,The handle broke on this and unfortunately it is unusable. I do have another color that is working great so far.,2
8/31/2023,Ordered online cup was dented on arrival and a week later the handle came off. But it did keep ice very well. Perhaps I was just unlucky,2
8/1/2023,"Decent cup, lid suctions on too tight, broke handle off trying to open the lid. I don't drink water cold so cannot comment on that.",2
8/28/2023,The straw doesn't align with either a right or left handed hold. It's off to the side. It does keep things cold. Probably would just by the Stanley,2
9/3/2023,"Cute colors but does not keep liquids cold very long. Also, mine did not include a straw that actually fit the drink.",2
9/17/2023,Nice size cup and the handle is convenient but ice melts within an hour and the cup leaks if it's tipped over,2
8/20/2023,"Nice cup and comparable to the Stanley cup, however the handle snapped off after a couple weeks of using it.",2
7/2/2023,"It's light weight, but the handle is wiggly, not spill proof at all and does an okay job of keeping drinks cold",2
8/2/2023,the handle broke off within a month.  great cup otherwise but the handle isn't welded or bolted on strongly,2
6/22/2023,The pink is cute however the white on the cup and the white on the handle are different. The cup is stainless steel while the handle is cheap looking plastic at least on this color combo.,2
11/26/2023,Not very spill proof and you must use the straw or you will not get a clean drink.,2
12/24/2023,sent with broken straw not in original package,2
11/16/2023,cup leaks if bumped over. i would return if i could,2
11/9/2023,The bottom is very dented so doesn't sit up straight.,2
11/15/2023,I was using this cup for about a month and the handle broke off. 💔,2
11/7/2023,handle is held on by two small screws.  handle loose  and wobbly,2
7/10/2023,Handle fell off after 2 weeks! Love the color and cup tho.  Just made terribly.,2
7/10/2023,Handle broke during second use.,2
8/11/2023,Loved these at first. Then they Started  to rust inside ?? Only used water in it,2
8/20/2023,came with dents all over it,2
7/29/2023,"Keeps drinks cold, but handle fell off after first use.",2
7/15/2023,The handle broke away from the tumbler within a month of use.,2
8/13/2023,"I do not like the screw on lid, very hard to losen up.",2
9/2/2023,Handle broke off the first week.,2
8/19/2023,The cup was broken %26 i returned the cup,2
8/11/2023,"It looked great, but the handle broke off the first time we used it.",2
9/17/2023,Keeps cool but dents easily. The straw gets stuck.,2
7/6/2023,The handle broke at the bottom without being dropped,2
8/28/2023,its not a Stanley..the ice melts like a normal cup..and doesnt stay cold like said,2
7/16/2023,the cup shipped to me without a lid or straw,2
9/6/2023,Loved it until one day I was putting the lid on and the handle broke off.,2
7/11/2023,I absolutely loved this tumbler but I only had it for two months before the handle snapped off.,2
4/6/2023,"Cute cup but doesn’t hold ice for very long and sweats on the outside. To me, the Stanley is worth the extra cost",2
5/21/2023,This is a really cute cup and a fraction of what the Stanley cups are selling for. But… after a month and a half my handle has popped off.,2
3/30/2023,Loved the cup but lid is so hard to put on. Bought it twice and returned them both because of issue of with lid,2
3/17/2023,Cup came in mail broken. The bottom of the handle wasn't attached to the cup and there are scratches all over it. Returning and asking for a replacement.,2
1/27/2024,"Lid is a disaster. Nice cup. Good choices in colors. Handle doesn't stay tight. The lid leaks bad. With or without straw a tip over will require a cleanup. Drinking without straw is also difficult due to where hole lines up with handle after screwing on lid. Ozark trail is usually my go to brand at Walmart,but this purchase will be returned.",2
6/21/2023,I loved this cup but it didn't last long. After a few weeks of use the handle fell off.,2
5/17/2023,straw was broken. Said will be deliver next day. Took more than a week.,2
5/7/2023,Cup handle broke after 2 weeks,2
6/24/2023,Not very sturdy and spills easily,2
4/24/2023,Tjis does not keep cold very long. That is disappointing. Still a nice cup and good sized.,2
1/9/2024,"Tastes funny even after a few washes. Also made me anxious. Anyone experience anything similar? Also has that lead button at the bottom everyone has been talking about with the stanleys. I recommend getting the 32 oz ozark and buy the handle instead. No button on the bottom, and no funny taste. Sad I'm not happy with it, but glad I didn't pay full price. It looks really nice and feels sturdy though.",2
1/30/2024,My tumbler arrived without the straw that was advertised as included with the tumbler.  Extremely disappointed as a regular straw is too short. Limited use of the tumbler because of this,2
1/17/2024,"Thought I was winning when I bought the knock off, but I was wrong. Had it for 3 weeks and the handle broke trying to get the lid off. The color is cute but the white part turned color just from everyday use at work. It did keep my water cold though",2
10/7/2023,Love this cup and the colors it comes in (better than the Stanley colors in my opinion). I also love the silicone top of the straw as I have two toddlers who love to steal my drinks but are terrible on straws. BUT the handle broke within the first month of using it. Very sad and otherwise this was my favorite cup! Was planning on buying another one until that happened.,2
2/5/2024,"straw is weird, half hard half soft. hatd to clean. the screw on lid is tough to unscrew unless yiu are tarzan.",2
10/24/2023,Keeps water cold otherwise I'd give it only one star. Handle began to wiggle after a few uses and now the handle has completely fallen off. Would not recommend if you are looking for a cup with a sturdy handle.,2
1/13/2024,It appears that the part that keeps it leakproof was not included in my shipment so it leaks a lot.,2
12/30/2023,the lid kept getting stuck and the handle fell off,2
11/13/2023,Love the cup! Or I did.....until the handle broke off after 7 months.,2
8/25/2023,handle broke off where it is welded at the top after less than 2 months,2
9/22/2023,The handle broke off after about 2 weeks.,2
10/4/2023,handle broke within the first month,2
10/4/2023,Scratched up when i got it. Returned it.,2
6/8/2023,This has never kept my drink cold longer than a couple hours…inside or out I'm very unimpressed compared to my other similar cups,2
4/11/2023,Had to return didn’t come with straw and listed in description,2
3/13/2023,handle snapped on day 3 😞,2
6/28/2023,"Nice tumblers, but the $14.99 price was more suitable.",2
11/10/2023,"it isn't super clear that this straw is in two pieces - the top part is silicone. i much prefer plastic, especially since the top of this straw has an emblem which feels weird when you drink from it. doesnt keep ice particularly colder than other stainless steel bottles. much prefer my Reduce cup instead.",3
11/24/2023,"It's great, but came in a repacked box and not in an original box like the other 9 I ordered. This item is scuffed up and looks like it was pulled off the floor. I'm giving this item away as a gift and will need to go into the store to exchange 
Why would someone send me a scuffed up 20 dollar cup?",3
9/29/2023,"Good size, bigger would have been too heavy when full. There is a small, permanent blue smudge on this one that I can not remove. The cup doesn't keep ice solid as long as I expected, but it's ok. The thing I do not like is that it is hard to position the lid with the straw to a selected spot, right side or left side. The top screws on, hard to control where it stops. I do like the handle, comfortable to hold.",3
12/19/2023,I really liked the tumbler specially because it was a gift for my kids teacher and her favorite color is purple but when it arrived it didn't have the straw,3
4/20/2023,"Filled with ice at 6 o'clock this morning by 10 refilled, just picked up my cup for a drink melt it again
I was able to sublimate on it, so that's a plus
I really like the straw… 
However, I want ice cold water

Not terrible for $15 but not great either",3
3/13/2023,"Keeping ice cold is all that this cup has going for it. The handle is plastic and on the upper handle where the screw is it is cracked, whete the bottle handle connects to the cup it is dented so there is a gap between the handle and cup. Not a very good design.",3
3/6/2023,"This is quite large but not as heavy as a person would think.  It does keep contents warm (started at 180 degrees and maintained for 30 minutes.)  It does not fit in standard car cup holders, unfortunately, which I presume is the reason for the shape.  We tried it both our cars and it did not fit either one.",3
2/5/2024,Doesn't hold ice long. But overall love the color and style,3
9/20/2023,The cup however not worth 19.99 the handle broke 4 weeks in . Still use it just wish the handle wouldn't of broke. Ice last 24 hours plus .,3
5/2/2023,The cup does keep drinks hot or cold. However about 1 month in the handle came apart.,3
11/11/2023,"fell off my car while i was unpacking groceries 3 days after i bought it. bottom is now slightly dented so it doesnt sit right and the lid broke. they dont seem to sell replacement lids, and i tried a brand off amazon and it didnt fit so now the cup is useless to me an ill have to buy a replacement.",3
2/9/2024,"No problem w/car cup holder nor breakage of handle.  While other reviews cite the convenience of transfer from fountain drinks into this container, I like my water to stay cold.  This doesn't insulate drinks for long, so I prefer stainless steel.  I had no problems drinking through the included straw, but buying a set of extras is a smart backup.  The lid stays on firmly.  Overall,  I'll get my money's worth more than the highly-touted brand.  it's better than the wastefulness of buying vending machine water.",3
7/6/2023,"Keeps drinks very cold and ice frozen for a long period of time.  I bought this as a joke because my daughter raves about her ""Stanley""... Unfortunately the handle snapped on it after a couple weeks.  I still use it, but its still broken even after trying to reattach.",3
1/6/2024,"I ordered a purple one and a green one. The purple was great! The green one was uneven on the bottom so it rocks when you place it down. Also, the handle is a different shade of green than the rest of the tumbler. It had a faded cheap look to the handle. Very disappointed.",3
1/8/2024,"I ordered this insulated tumbler because it was advertised to be commensurate with the Stanley tumbler that is so popular right now, but much more expensive.  I ordered this in Aqua Blue but what I received is mint green.  There was no packing slip included in my order.  Not good.",3
11/12/2023,"it's a great cup, but the bottom is dented so it doesn't sit straight which is probably not the case for most of these cups but worth saying. also it leaks baaaaaad, but your level of clumsiness/chaos in terms of animals and children determine the level of importance for that.",3
12/18/2023,"This brand is great. Better than all others I have. But there seems to be a design flaw in the 40 oz I just bought. I have a 32 oz that is old but keeps ice all thru the night. The 40 oz I just purchased is top heavy and has fell over many times.  I will not use this one again. I have taken out my old 32 oz tumbler and it still amazes me how well it works at holding ice, day and night.",3
11/19/2023,"This cup was a pretty color, but I did not love the straw. The top of the straw was soft, so it compressed together every time I took a drink. Also, when screwing on the lid, the straw never ended up in the right place so it made it awkward to use the handle.",3
11/23/2023,"First let me say that I'm a cup snob. Initially, I loved this cup so much that I considered buying a second and tossing all of my others. It's that good. Until today. I've now used this cup daily for the last 15 days and today, the straw broke. It's never been out of the cup other than to wash it and then it goes straight back in. I'm not even sure at what point it broke because I was drinking out of it and all of a sudden, my drink wasn't coming through the straw anymore. I opened it up and to my surprise, the side of the straw is busted out. It makes no sense considering how well it has been taken care of. The cup itself is still in fantastic condition - it keeps my water cold for easily 24  hours and I will absolutely continue to use it....",3
4/13/2023,Love the tumbler but I’m really sad that the handle just broke as i was putting the top back on it. I went to pick it up after i tightened the top and the handle broke. Have not dropped it or done anything strenuous to it at all. Literally bought this not even 2 weeks ago.,3
4/16/2023,I bought 2 (blue %26 black) %26 they’re both dented at the bottom so they’re wobbly ): i was so excited for these but i’m worried they’ll fall over %26 dents usually mess up the insulation. It’s hard to tell through picture but the bottoms are bowed from the dents.,3
1/14/2024,It's ok doesn't keep cold for too long but I love the size. It's not leak proof but it works good. I loved the color even more it person then in the pictures.,3
1/20/2024,Was so excited about these tumblers and purchased 3. However I absolutely hate the lids!!! They never go on correctly no matter how many times I try. I get so frustrated trying to put them on I end up using my yeti.,3
10/12/2023,The lid and straw. I have used the tumbler for iced tea. When you fill it with ice the silicone top straw must be laced through the lid hole through the underside. Then the lid is screwed on. The straw hole is to the side not centered I. The lid so the whole mass of ice cubes must be turned with the straw while aligning the screw lid which doesn't align easily with floating ice.  Would prefer a solid plastic or metal straw and a centered straw hole!,3
3/27/2023,"I wanted to like this tumbler so badly, as I love my other cups/coozies from this brand, but sadly I returned it. I didn’t like the top part of the straw, the rubber/silicon collected lint and dust and don’t seem like it’d be easy to keep clean. I would have replaced the straw with something different if I’d kept it. I also was not a fan of the twist lid. I wish it was just a push down lid like the other cups. I tried twisting it on a couple different ways but the straw hole never really hit center like I’d want it to in comparison with the handle. Overall the black color was sleek and it seemed to be very good quality. A new lid and straw and I’d be sold!",3
7/21/2023,"Bought the first one and got home to realize there was a dent in the bottom.   Went back and picked out another one, felt around the bottom for a dent and exchanged.   As I was walking out realized the handle was loose on the one I just bought and had to go back and exchange again.   I would check all aspects of this tumbler before purchasing.     Otherwise I think it is a good product and great value.",3
8/19/2023,"The cup is nice %26 has held up so far after a few weeks of use. It is a tight fit in the dishwasher, but it goes in %26 gets clean. I took off 1 star because the lid can sometimes be difficult to twist off, and 1 star because the handle moves slightly when im trying to get the lid off. I'm worried the handle will eventually fall off, but it's working for now %26 the cup keeps my water cold all day.",3
7/18/2023,it works extremely well at keeping drinks and ice cold for long periods of time (i left my cup of ice water in my car for my entire 10 hour shift in the 100° heat and there was still ice) HOWEVER the handle is cheap and mine broke off within 3 days of having the cup. i still use the cup without the handle but was extremely disappointed.,3
2/1/2024,It doesn't keep my ice very long and once the ice melts my drink really doesn't stay that cold. Easy to keep clean though and love the straw!,3
2/17/2024,This is ok. It's not a Stanley. Doesn't keep ice cold as long as the Stanley. Not bad for a knockoff though.,3
2/15/2024,I love this cup but this one did not arrive in a box as my other 3 did. Makes me wonder if it was used? Or returned? Gross.,3
11/15/2023,"The handle was wobbly from the start. Tried to tighten the little screws but they only go so far in and the solder broke. The cup itself it great, just wish the handle was more sturdy.",3
10/13/2023,its a great cup they just need to figure out the weld on the top of the handle. id just make it another screw on.,3
4/18/2023,"I’ve done the test between yetis, Stanley’s, and Ozark Trail. I was on trial keeps the ice longer than both our competitors. However, I recently purchased the large Tumblr with the handle. And the handle came off within two weeks.",3
1/10/2024,"Very cute cup %26 seems good quality but it arrived with a big scratch down the front, so that's super disappointing.",3
1/25/2024,"Ordered this mug online. It arrived dented, missing the straw and the color is peeling off where it is dented.",3
1/14/2024,"Was bought as a gift for someone, she loves it but im upset the handle is super wobbly but it can be tightened.",3
1/19/2024,"I thought it was going to kick ace like a Stanley, but didn't.  The ice melts by the next day.  I still like it, but its not s 5 star for sure.",3
10/27/2023,The design is odd. It only offers the straw option and the lid does not screw on easily enough. It should provide a better opening to drink without the straw and the lid should twist or snap on easier.,3
7/22/2023,"The size and function of this cup is great, but the handle is very weak. We have two and the handle snapped off of one, and I can feel the other one wanting to break.",3
7/8/2023,"This cup is nice %26 it's does its job, but Not even two weeks of having it and it's already peeling. I was very disappointed to say the least. I got lavender and navy both are peeling and I baby them",3
9/20/2023,I love this cup except the lid is very difficult to line up correctly or to sometimes remove! With that said this cup does not leak and keeps things cold therefore I still use it daily!!,3
8/26/2023,"The handle of this broke within the first month of getting it. It felt loose when it arrived, so I wasn't terribly surprised. Otherwise, I really loved this cup! It made me drink so much water and it fits in most cup holders.",3
9/9/2023,"I love my cup, but the handle broke off within a month of having it. I do love it otherwise and bought a second one. If this one breaks there will not be a third times a charm!",3
7/12/2023,"It keeps drinks cold and it's a very cheap alternative to the Stanley. I love the straw. However, it was too big to fit into my standard size car cup holder. I had to 3D print an insert. I ended up buying a different cup to travel with.",3
8/1/2023,The color was pretty and it held ice for a long time. The only thing I didn't like is it didn't fit the cup holder in my car and spilled a few times so I gave it to a friend who loves it!,3
7/30/2023,"I really do like this cup! It keeps your drinks ice cold and your hot drinks hot for HOURS!! The reason I didnt give it five stars, is because the lid leaks :(",3
6/25/2023,"At first I was pleased with the style and color. However, after use- I soon found that the cup stains- when poring:making coffee into the cup and splash or spills occur they remain on the mug. Nothing takes it off %26 It became unpleasant to look at. Maybe a father color would be better.",3
5/13/2023,"Cup leaked in multiple spots, not just the spout. Handle broke off second day of use. Kept water cold and I liked the straw feature but now the cup just sits in the cabinet because of no handle and two square spots on the cup where the handle screws were.",3
6/12/2023,I bought this as a replacement for one my husband had that had the handle break off after about a month of ownership. I have a purple one of my own and it has a sturdy handle so we figured it was a fluke. This one arrives and has a shaky handle so we will be returning it. Had I not ordered online I'd have been able to check the handle so just beware that the handle may be an issue.,3
1/30/2024,I have had it for less than a month and it's pealing already.,3
2/14/2024,It's a bit too big and the lid is hard to get off and on right,3
1/26/2024,"Would have been 4 or 5 stars if the handle wasn't loose, and it would not tighten",3
1/29/2024,I don't like the straw's being permanent.,3
2/6/2024,Good capacity.  Water doesn't stay cold even with ice for more than about 4-6 hours.,3
2/16/2024,I love a dupe but I hate that the handle gets loose. Holds ice really well.,3
11/12/2023,The cup tilted when it was sat down and the straw was cracked. Kept drinks cold. I'm sure I just got a bad cup.,3
12/21/2023,"I'm on my third day using it and so far it  hasn't kept my water cold, only cool to temperate, as the ice melts fast.",3
1/11/2024,"It didn't fit my Honda Pilot drink holders. the cut was too large, making it spill over",3
1/24/2024,handle is loose already and doesn't keep drinks very cold.,3
1/14/2024,i got this cup a few months ago it does great but ice does melt fast!!,3
1/18/2024,I like it but it's too big,3
1/22/2024,This 40oz.  Up is too big and too Havea y. I will return for 30oz.,3
10/24/2023,Bought this because I couldn't make myself pay Stanley prices. This Ozark Trail cup is okay for the price. Doesn't hold ice for too long.,3
10/13/2023,I bought it to try it out and the cup is so large that it makes me feel odd drinking out of it. It does keep my drink cold for the work day.,3
9/9/2023,"Unfortunately the lid screws on difficulty and the straw isn't aligned with the front or back, more towards the sides.",3
8/9/2023,So far it's keeping my iced tea cold during the day ( but not overnight.)  I don't like the straw. It's not leak- proof.  I would not purchase again.,3
8/10/2023,The lid gets stuck and very hard to remove. Doesn't keep drinks as cold as some of the other cups I've tried.,3
8/10/2023,Loved! Sadly can't give it 5 stars because the bottom part of the handle came off and now I can't use it,3
7/26/2023,Loved how the tumbler kept my drink cold. Didn't like the fact that it made my water taste like a metal taste. Going to take the tumbler back.,3
7/7/2023,"Love this tumbler, very similar to the Stanley quencher. Wanted a second but saw the price has gone up $5 since March, which is ridiculous.",3
5/6/2023,I have the 40 0z cup and it leaks if tipped over.  My similar cup by Simple Modern is way better  and leakproof. But for the price this ok for home use to remind me to keep drinking that water!,3
6/6/2023,"So the water is cool after 24 hours but ice was melted, I like the flexible straw but was hoping ice would last longer. For that price tho it's a great mug.",3
11/23/2023,Kind of false advertisement if you dont read the description. The cup does NOT come with a straw!!,3
12/3/2023,the handle broke on it about 2 months after i bought the cup,3
12/22/2023,Most times I set it on most surfac s it falls over.,3
11/4/2023,the lid had no vent to use without straw,3
12/16/2023,the straw holder was lose,3
12/9/2023,the cup came very dirty and there is eithet a scuff or small scratch i cant get out,3
11/3/2023,Very good at keeping my drinks cold.  But take care because it's top heavy and easily tips over!,3
11/12/2023,"As for looks it cool, but it leaks really bad if knocked over.",3
3/4/2023,"So I have the namebrand version of this type of mug that went viral on TikTok. This Tumblr has the same look and almost does just as good of a job. So for same-day use you are going to still have a cold drink all day. One difference I can see is overnight. Why am I drink? Does stay cold the ice does not stay in the cup in melt were in the name brand version overnight I still have ice in the Tumbler. Overall, I think this is a pretty good dupe in a sense if you don't want to spend the money on the brand version I can see there is definitely different quality in the handle of the cup and the weight of the cup but if you're not picky and you just want a large Tumblr for your drink and they should be fine",3
8/22/2023,Doesn't keep ice for long and doesn't hold up well with normal wear and tear,3
8/2/2023,Good except the handle broke off very easily,3
8/12/2023,Top is hard to get off and on,3
10/2/2023,didnt include straw. otherwise great!,3
8/12/2023,Cup was great until handle broke off,3
8/7/2023,Wanted it to have a sip slot as well as a straw.,3
7/27/2023,"Great size and versatile, however, the handle broke off after 2-3 month use.",3
8/7/2023,I loved the cup but it only lasted 3 weeks and the handle fell off.,3
10/5/2023,"Bottom of cup is too narrow ,it tips over.",3
7/14/2023,I love how cold it keeps everything. Not a fan of the silicone straw,3
9/12/2023,"Love the cup, but when ordered to be shipped, it arrived without a straw.",3
7/4/2023,Came with a dent in it. Ice melts quicker then I thought it would.,3
8/9/2023,I loved how it kept ice for a long time but it is starting to chip,3
8/28/2023,My cup had a stain due to the big tag it comes with 🥺,3
10/5/2023,It leaks just like the Stanley.,3
7/2/2023,It holds a lot of water and I can't taste the rubber straw. It doesn't hold ice very long thought,3
8/23/2023,Great cup but straw broke almost immediately. had to buy replacement ones off amazon.,3
6/30/2023,Didn't come with a straw like in the picture.,3
9/9/2023,handle didnt stay tight long.,3
9/11/2023,I enjoy the cups as a Stanley dupe but leaks quite often,3
7/23/2023,"Pretty color, doesn't keep ice though.",3
7/10/2023,The lid is hard to get on and off sometimes. Would not buy again.,3
7/3/2023,"Straw doesn't have a lid, and the actual lid doesn't close with the straw",3
8/28/2023,Very similar to the famous Stanley but doesn't keep drinks cold very long,3
7/19/2023,didnt think the quality was up to par on this one but its a cute cup i returned mine,3
8/15/2023,"Overall a great mug that keeps ice cold, however the paint is chipping off after the first wash.",3
7/15/2023,"Dropped it once and the handle broke off. Insulates well, just not built very durable.",3
7/26/2023,the handle broke the first time i tried to open the cup,3
8/12/2023,it doesnt let you drink from your left hand,3
8/9/2023,Handle broke off after a few weeks. Walmart replaced it.,3
8/16/2023,Handle is loose and jiggles back and forth,3
7/26/2023,This cup is great for keeping drinks cold. But it is so tall that it is easy to knock over.,3
7/18/2023,Nice cup but it stains on the outside.,3
9/23/2023,"Doesn't kind ice from melting very well, but like that it has a comfortable handle",3
7/28/2023,Not good for hard elements handle came off in a month still would buy again do,3
9/22/2023,handle broke off after a few months.,3
10/24/2023,"Doesn't hold ice as well at my yeti, but i like the straw and handle",3
8/29/2023,"I love this cup! Very good at holding ice, however very unstirdy, my handle broke the first week😕",3
7/14/2023,"The one I received didn't come with a straw, otherwise a great cup. Stays cold for a long time!",3
7/14/2023,easy to hold and transport. fits in cup holder. water doesn't stay cold long,3
6/2/2023,Works great but lid is difficult to get off. I'll barely tighten it and it is still difficult to remove when I go back to fill it up.,3
4/13/2023,It doesn’t stay as cold as I would like but for the price it’s acceptable I suppose. It does leak if tipped. Just a warning. Lol,3
5/16/2023,Not my favorite cup. It's very heavy. Only redeeming quality is it fits in my car cup holders. The size is awkward.,3
3/28/2023,It a big fan of the pieced together straw…would prefer a solid 1 piece straw instead.  The cup on the other hand is GREAT!!!,3
5/24/2023,"It's s great dupe of the Stanley cup, However mine came with a loose handle and I've read other reviews where the handles fell off,",3
1/27/2024,"I purchased this for the 40oz feature that could/would fit in cup holder in vehicle.

I m a LONG time Ozark owner.  This particular cup is disappointing!  I'd doesn't hold the ice as long as my other Ozarks.  My others don't fit in my vehicle cup holder.  This is extremely disappointing for me.

I wouldn't purchase again, knowing the ice in the cup last only a few hours.  I'm not sure if it's even made to keep ice 18-24 hours like the older version..",3
2/17/2024,I used this cup for a couple weeks and loved it. Then one day I accidentally knocked it off a side table next to my couch. It landed on the lid and broke the lid spilling water all over. The weight from the full cup must have been too much for the plastic lid. I elected to replace it with a tumbler with a metal lid.,3
6/25/2023,"its nice enough and serves its purpose.  however, yhe bottom is not even so it wobbles slightly",3
3/16/2023,great value for the money. But it doesn't fit the cup holders in my car.,3
6/23/2023,Love this cup! Bummer that the price jumped $5 in the last month.,3
5/11/2023,Love the color but it doesn't stay cold as my other tumbler,3
6/10/2023,Nice tumbler but my handle broke ☹️,3
4/25/2023,holds 40 oz but doesn't keep drink cold,3
6/13/2023,Handle is rickety. Feels loose. Ice melts faster than I thought it would.,3
6/21/2023,Nice cups but not very durable. The handle on the two we purchased came loose.,3
5/10/2023,Was in a bag lost grip of the bag it fell and the Handle came off on the top,3
6/21/2023,Nice but not durable. The handles on both of our cups came loose.,3
5/21/2023,The handle broke after normal usage.  The contents remaun cold for 2-3 days.,3
6/27/2023,Keeps ice cold but handle broke off within a week,3
6/3/2023,i dont like the dents that it cane with 😔,3
1/6/2024,"I love all my other Ozark trail tumblers, but I cannot love this one due to the screw on top!!!  Make it like all the other tumblers with a push on top and I'll give it 5 stars.  With this silly screw on thing, you get 3 stars.  Please make it with a push on top so I don't have to spend $45 for a Stanley cup!!",3
1/8/2024,I've had my tumbler since late summer. I use it at least once a week. It's now January and it has started to make a noise. It literally sounds like there is an object rolling around inside the cup. I cannot figure out where the sound is coming from. The handle and screws are still intact. It's quite annoying.,3
1/24/2024,"I love the water bottle. The handle is great, I love the color, it fits great in my car, and I really love the half silicone straw on top.

However, there it's one con, and it's a major one for me. This bottle does not seem to keep ice. Once I fill the bottle with ice and then add water to it, the ice is melted within a couple of hours. If even that long. It's disappointing.",3
1/10/2024,"I got this cup from my father-in-law for Christmas. I love the look and feel AND of course the size, but I am constantly having to replace ice. Like every few hours at least which is disappointing because I'm not always somewhere that I can do that. Plus it's cold outside so I'm guessing during summer it's going to be twice the struggle so I'm definitely disappointed.",3
1/3/2024,The cup is light and easy to grip. The problem is getting the straw in the right place to work for me. The screw top seemed to cross thread or just put the straw in the wrong place. If you don't care about those things this cup is fine for you. I learned I prefer the tervis-type gasket lids to put the straw in just the right place.,3
10/10/2023,"The kids easily crack. Cup is ergonomic and easy to hold and fit in cup holders. The ice stay cold for hours even overnight. However, if you drop the cup at all the kids crack. I've had 3 lids crack just from dropping out of the dishwasher or on the ground. They don't offer replacement lids either. I do like the straws but wish they sold both replacements separately.",3
7/20/2023,"When I first got this cup I loved it. My drinks stayed cold and ice didn't melt for at least 24 hours, sometimes longer. It is annoying that the straw isn't in the middle because I can't always get the straw to line up right (that could definitely be user error). The last thing that recently started happening, my ice isn't lasting as long as it was as before, it will last maybe six hours in my cup. I did accidentally drop the cup, and I am thinking I may have done something to the insulation, but I have dropped it before, and it didn't affect the cup",3
2/1/2024,The 40oz cup is too big. It is difficult to close the screw on lid with ice in the cup and the straw in place.  Grams,3
1/2/2024,dropped from about 3 ft and cap broke already only had it for a few weeks. otherwise decent and keeps drinks cold,3
9/25/2023,Nice large cup that fits in cup holder. Ice melted within a normal work day. This was many days of trying it out. I live where it is hot and it does not keep drinks cold like other brands.,3
6/3/2023,"It's pretty reasonably priced in comparison to others. I'm a tumbler, cup, mug, bottle collector, so this one isn't the greatest but for $15 it's not a bad option. It has a soft texture finish but mine doesn't keep drinks and cold as I'd prefer. It does keep drinks cool but not icy cold like other tumblers I have. If it rips over it will leak. Idk these are pretty popular right now and I'm not sure if I could truthfully say this is the best option for long span cold drinks. It will keep them cool during a 8-10 hour work day but just not icy cold. Matter of fact when I filled it with solid thick ice at 6am at work by 9am my ice was barley visible and had melted the drink was still cool but I don't the the tech this mug offers can keep things...",3
5/25/2023,"This is a great alternative to the expensive tumblers!! Mine works great for holding my ice water all day and fits perfectly in the cupholder. BUT... the photo online is a little misleading. For some, this may not be a big deal but it is increasingly driving me nuts. The photo depicts the tumbler being right-handed with the straw closest to the edge. 

While you can hold the tumbler in your right hand (obviously), the straw is on the opposite side. I checked to see if the lid could be switched over and no matter what I do- it still screws in the same spot. Being a right-handed person, it's annoying to try and switch hands. Also noting that when driving a car, most cupholders are on the right side of the driver. So, when I try to pick this u...",3
2/9/2024,A little disappointed. wish I had returned for a shorter one but nothing wrong with it.,3
2/20/2024,This is not a Thermos.  It does not keep items hot near as long as Thermos does.,3
12/12/2023,"love the cup. holds ice for about 20 hours
 arrived scratched, staw is hard to clean, lid will get stuck on if you put it on tightly!",3
12/15/2023,It's wonderful to have the handle but it's too tall to fit in some cup holders.  Keeps things perfectly cold or hot for hours!,3
11/9/2023,"They need to work on the durability of the handle and  it would be great, it did keep drinks cold and held ice great!",3
1/16/2024,"it fits nicely in cup holders in car. 
But it's to heavy",3
1/22/2024,The handle color does not match the color of the cup,3
10/3/2023,"Love this cup, but the handle popped off after a few months of use %26 you can't easily reattach it.",3
10/10/2023,"After 2 weeks of use the handle broke unfortunately, other then that it's nice but I will probably replace with a different brand",3
7/19/2023,"I love the tumbler, but after 2 weeks the handle broke :( I always love ozark product, but i am disappointed in this.",3
9/26/2023,Way over priced the cost should be $15 bucks the product does not maintain keeping your drink cold or hot for long period of time maybe 3hrs .,3
11/29/2023,The handle broke off after 1 week. Still keeps water cold though.,3
11/27/2023,they keep things cold but the handles break easy,3
10/13/2023,"it is okay, the handle is loose and can't be tightened. Does keep drinks cold.",3
9/27/2023,i really loved this mug. but the handle broke off after a week.,3
10/26/2023,"Haven't tried it with hot drinks yet, but it's doesn't keep drinks cold for very long.",3
10/26/2023,Love these cups although Ive only had it for less than a month and straw broke,3
10/17/2023,"Not very sturdy, dropped and the handle fell off.",3
5/1/2023,I placed a pickup order for this and they brought it out to me with no straw. The product itself is good but walmart keeps disappointing me.,3
4/10/2023,"Great size and keeps ice cold, but scratches very easily. Have barely used mine and there are already two very ugly scratches in the coating.",3
5/16/2023,Love the tumbler. Hate the lid. Hard to screw on/off - impossible if you have small hands or arthritis.,3
6/7/2023,Price was $14.97 then 2 weeks later it was at $19.97!? I paid $19.97!,3
3/20/2023,"I was supposed to get four cups  ,only  got two ,why?",3
4/14/2023,Good cup but incredibly hard to get the lid off,3
11/17/2023,"Live these 40 oz. Wish it did not have a screw on lid. Only trouble was how they came! In a HUGE box, box was mostly gaping open. Six tumblers were in separate boxes for protection. 3 we're just thrown in tumbled around. I'm very lucky that none fell out of the box! Whoever packed it at the ware house needs a lesson on packing!",4
1/16/2024,"Was searching for a Stanley Tumbler  and this popped up, thought it was one until it arrived and noticed was totally a different brand. But looks the same, not so much concerned about the brand name at this point.",4
1/22/2024,Great price. Keeps ice water cold all day. Only complaint would be the handle color is off compared to the cup color. For the price you can't beat it though.,4
7/15/2023,"Love the color. It's well made and keeps things cool in the Arizona heat. It fits in the cup holder just like the Stanley I wish the lid was white or clear and was spill proof around the straw. Be aware you cannot put Stanley lids on this, they don't fit.",4
3/8/2023,"This cup is really nice looking. I got white and I love the color. It is a great, large 40 ounces and keeps my ice water cold all day. The straw has a flexible, rubbery tip, which helps it stay in the straw hole of the lid and makes it easy to drink out of. I like the flexible straw, but my teenager thought it was weird. The only thing I don't like about this cup is that it isn't spilled off at all. If it is tipped sideways water pours out of the middle of the lid where the extra plastic piece connects, in addition to the straw hole. I understand that a lid with a straw will not be completely spill proof, but I think it could be done better. Overall I like this cup a lot and I use it every single day.",4
3/31/2023,"I bought this because the internet told me I needed it. I don’t own a Stanley, and I’m cheap, so a $15 Ozark Trail dupe caught my eye. Plus, the pattern looks like a FL sunset. 

I died when I saw how big it is. My husband says I look ridiculous hauling the giant cup around and it doesn’t fit in my coffee maker (yes I do need a keg of iced coffee, thank you very much). The handle is nice, albeit large like everything else on the cup. The lid screws on and the closure system is intuitive.

The straw is trash though and made this giant cup loose one giant star. It’s like 2/3 plastic and 1/3 flexible silicone. Mine arrived ripped so it’s completely useless. I used one of my large Tervis straws instead, which look extra small in this enormous c...",4
8/18/2023,This is about half the price of some other more expensive brand. It looks nice. Not cheap looking. My only complaint is condensation forms around the rim and the top of the lid.,4
3/11/2023,"The 40OZ VACUUM INSULATED STAINLESS STEEL TUMBLER is a nice looking cup. Quality made. The handle is comfortable for such a large cup. The cup/tumbler doesn't leak when you sip either, that's always a plus. I used it for my coffee while I was at work. The cup/tumbler didn't keep my coffee hot very long. It also won't prevent spills. It's a functional cup/tumbler.",4
3/3/2023,I love that this is stainless steel and it's so big! 40 oz which I didn't realize how large that is it's a really good size cup with a nice handle. The side is stain resistant or it's so sweat resistant or something like that but I like it the blue color is nice too. It does not come with a straw,4
3/2/2023,"This pretty travel mug is huge!  I wanted to see how it would work in the car so I took it when we went on a recent trip.  This mug holds a lot of coffee.   And it does a great job of keeping the coffee hot enough for a long time.  My coffee was still hot 3 hours after I poured it.  It fit in my drink holder even with another smaller travel mug beside it.  However, the handle seems to be on the wrong side of the mug. When I picked the drink up by the handle with my right hand, the straw/drinking hole was on the other side of the mug so I couldn't get to it.  I had to turn the mug handle around to the left and pick the mug up by the side so I could drink out of it without spilling the liquid.  It almost seems to be made for left handed peopl...",4
3/5/2023,The 40 Oz. Ozark Trail stainless steel tumbler is great for camping or everyday use.  It is well insulated.  It is easy to carry with the comfortable carrying handle.  It is super easy to fill with ice and liquid as the opening is large enough to do that.  This also makes it easy to clean.  I also love the large size as it holds 40 Oz of your favorite beverage.,4
3/6/2023,Products from this brand are usually good and this time is no different. I tried this tumbler with cold water and juice so far and the drinks stayed cold for many hours. My one complaint would be the straw. I don't like that the top of the straw is uncovered and the type of material that stuff sticks to. It feels less sanitary because of that but I'll just use it in the house.,4
3/9/2023,Really love this cup. Always need something to keep drinks cold and this does the trick. Place water and ice in cup and it stayed cold for hours. The only downside is that the straw doesn't have a cover. So I keep this one at home as I have to drink lots of water due to my medicine.,4
3/11/2023,"Love the size of this tumbler! Keeps my cold beverages cold and my hot beverages hot. It barely fits in my car's cup holder and the handle is wide and comfortable to hold. Very nice tumbler but I have an issue with the straw. The straw is in two pieces, a 9 3/4"" long semi-clear plastic straw with a 3 3/4"" long silicone sleeve attached to the end. The first time using it I washed all pieces in the dishwasher and upon taking the straw out I noticed the silicone sleeve had slipped all the way up the plastic straw.  I've tried for 2 days to pull out the sleeve again with no luck, it's stuck. I'm not sure why they didn't just make the plastic straw 12-13"" long without a sleeve?",4
3/24/2023,"Effective!
Pros: Spacious. Comfortable holding. Matte finish. Insulated well. 
Cons: the cup's cover is of plastic 
Overall: 4/5
The best feature of the cup is the large quantity that it can hold.  I use it for cold/hot water. The insulated feature works really well and extends the desired temperature. I once used it to hold chicken noodle soup and it kept the temperature well.  I used it several times for camping and got asked by several fellow hikers/campers. I also like how comfortable I feel when holding the cup.  The handle is big but not bulky. The material around the cup and the handle is matte so it feels soft and smooth.  The only thing I wanted to improve is the lid.  I wish the lid could be made of higher plastic quality or somet...",4
3/9/2023,"I like products made by Ozark Trail. They always seem well-made with well-conceived features. This tumbler is no exception. The soft purple color is very pretty. The lining is double-walled stainless steel and the capacity is very large - 40 ounces. The handle feels ergonomically correct and the bottom third of the tumbler tapers in to accommodate vehicle cup holders.

That said, for me personally, as a fairly petite person, I have some reservations. First of all, even empty, it is quite heavy and almost cumbersome when filled with a beverage. It doesn't fit all the way down into either of my car's generous cup holders, so it ends up leaning at a slight angle, hence some potential for spills. The screw-on lid locks into place in such a way ...",4
1/31/2024,"Just a little bigger then I thought it would be be, but I like it.",4
2/16/2024,"He had a dent in it, and the handle was loose!! Other than that I love it!!",4
1/20/2024,It's really pretty but wasn't packaged well so got a lil scuffed up and also missing the straw,4
2/24/2023,"This cup is huge.  With the straw inserted it is 14"" tall.  One of my pics is with it next to a 30oz cup I normally use and it is dwarfed by this one.  The bottom diameter is 3"" so it will fit most cupholders but unfortunately will just barely go in the top of the one in one of my cars which is German, and they don't believe in large cups for some reason.  The handle is pretty sturdy solid plastic that is screwed to tabs on the cup body.  The finish (white on mine) has a soft feel to it.  The top screws on and is gasketed along with a swivel tab that can be positioned for the straw (which has a silicone sleeve that seals against the straw hole), a drinking port, or sealed.  The straw is the only thing I'm not too sure about.  It is flexible...",4
2/26/2023,"The 40Oz Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel Tumbler-Blue is my new favorite tumbler that I currently own. There are many good features about this tumble. First its forty ounces, which is awesome. I always feel like my others are a bit too small for me. This one holds enough to get me through the day much better than a smaller one does. Second thing I like is the handle is actually attached to the cup and not a removable one. I have had issue with handles before and this one is sturdy and secure. Third I like the screw top lid, way better than the press in ones that don't seal well. Fourth is that the lid seals every time all the time. The one downside that I think it has would be the straw. I would have preferred either a metal straw or a sol...",4
2/27/2023,"I absolutely love this Ozark Trail Stainless 40oz. Tumbler, it has a really great lid that you twist on which is great because it helps prevent spills in case you drop it or knock it over, the handle on it is good size as I have larger hands and it accommodates them perfectly. The color of it is appealing and I love the straw that is included with it. Just a great tumbler all around!",4
2/28/2023,This cup is very similar to the Stanley cups I own. The cup fits well in cup holders and is designed nicely. These are lots better and upgraded from the older model tumblers. If you like Stanley's at a discounted price this Ozark brand is pretty darn close!,4
2/24/2023,"If you have never tried an insulated cup, it is a must! This cup is so easy to hold and carry because of its handle. It has a good hand grip that is textured and feels very sturdy. The cup is  large but it will fit in a standard cup holder. This cup keeps your beverage cold for hours! Using this overnight, it still had ice and a cold beverage in the morning. This cup works very well at maintaining temperature even in the heat! If you go to theme parks, zoos, sporting events, anywhere outdoors and want to keep a cold beverage  this is something to really consider. I do wish it included a straw but i didn't have any issues using an extra tall straw. This lid is screwed on so there is no issue with it popping off easily when in use. Lastly, th...",4
2/24/2023,"Pros: very large, heavy duty, easy to fill, big handle fits big hands, holds ice for over 24 hours, straw with silicone tip, lid opening can face either direction.  Cons:  while it would stop major spills the top still leaks slowly when closed, does not fit any of the different cup holders in my van.",4
1/7/2024,"I love this tumbler! My ice lasts just as long as any Stanley tumbler so I don't think there's any need to spend twice as much money, unless you are a brand fanatic and you need the other name on yours. However, if you're looking for a great quality tumbler at a better price, I highly recommend this one! 

I am deducting one star because of the straw. It was a weird mix of silicone and plastic, neither of which appeals to me. I purchased some suitable metal straws and that is what I use with my tumbler instead.",4
2/26/2023,This is great for taking o the go. The insulated tumbler keeps my drinks nice and cold for up to 12 hrs. The straw and lid are easy to remove and clean. I can put this in the dishwasher on the days I don't feel like hand cleaning.,4
2/10/2024,"Love the cup, but the handle broke off after a few months. I used it daily but will need to replace it/throw it away. Hopefully they'll replace it for free.",4
1/27/2024,"I love the color and having a handle is great, so much easier to pick it up and carry it. Being a big mug, filling it makes its heavy. The handle is a secure and non painful way to handle it. The straw is two pieces, the bottom portion is a regular straw and has to be inserted from the bottom of the lid. The top piece is flexible and needs to be placed over the bottom straw from the top of the lid. The seams on the top portion of the straw are very noticeable when taking a sip. It is a screw on lid which is my only issue with this mug. It is hard to line it up perfectly to start the screwing and in order to get the straw in the right place for me to drink while holding it by the handle, I need to start the screw 3/4 around the top. I really...",4
1/28/2024,"This keeps my ice all day while working and is a very Barbie pink. The price of $20 versus the $40 for the Stanley Cup we're pretty much the same product as what I like. The straw is kind of weird because it's short, but then has a squishy plastic mouthpiece, which I'm not liking but not a dealbreaker.",4
1/27/2024,"I needed something light weight with a comfortable handle, and this item works out great for both. It doesnt keep ice for as long as ""other"" brands but does keep ice long enough for me. The price is reasonable and there's not a bunch of dummies fighting over them.",4
2/5/2024,The cup itself is great. Love the color it holds a lot and keeps it cool. The straw however comes with the cylinder cover I guess and you have to put it on the straw otherwise the straw is not long enough and you cannot sip the beverage. And drinking out of it is difficult because the straw collapses. Will have to buy separate straw,4
2/7/2024,"This tumbler does a wonderful job at keeping beverages, cold, and also a very durable however, if tipped over and not picked up soon, it will leak the entire contents of the cup. I still believe this is an absolutely great cup. It just has a minor flaw.",4
1/29/2024,"Slipped on ice with this cup, and it didn't even get a dent or a scratch. Seems to be a great cup. Keeps ice even overnight and hot drinks stay warm all day. The straw is a bit weird, the very top portion is silicone and slightly larger than the opening in the lid. I believe it's to make a pretty tight seal to prevent leaks, but sometimes causes very small silicone shavings--especially if you change back and forth between using the straw or not. Be sure to buy a straw cleaner and maybe an extra pack of straws because you just get one with the purchase. Overall, would purchase again.",4
9/9/2023,"I have had this for 6 months now. It doesn't keep ice cold as long as it did when I first got it. I never put it in the dishwasher. I love the grooved handle! I looked at many other 40 oz cups and wasn't able to find a single other one like this. It may not keep ice as cold as long as the name brand but is way cheaper and that handle wins! Let's also mention the interchangeable top. Happy accident I discovered that the lids for all my ozark trail 30oz tumblers fit in this!! I am not a huge fan of screw on lids in general, so this was awesome!!!",4
3/2/2023,"This is a nice big cup!! I love the Ozark Trail tumblers and the handle on this one is very handy.  It's a 40oz mug so when it's got coffee or water or whatever you enjoy, it can be pretty heavy.  
The weight when full is 3.77 lbs so buy 2 of these and work out both your arms.  ;-) 
I was hoping the piece on the lid would be able to close off the drink hole to prevent spills, but it's not water-tight. 
I love the flexible end, connected to the included straw. It's soft and bends without cutting off the flow of coffee, water, sparkling water, or whatever.  You can use the tumbler with or without the straw.  Works well as a stirring stick, too. 
The base is a good size to fit in my car cup-holder.  Only thing I didn't like was the straw was o...",4
1/24/2024,"I love the scent of this candle. I just wish it was stronger. I've bought them before with a lid on the jar and they seem to smell better. This one just has a little cardboard circle over the top and I don't think it has a strong scent, but for the value price of five dollars I am very pleased and will continue to purchase it when it is on sale.",4
1/20/2024,"For the price point this is a great cup. I love the vibrant pink color, the handle is very comfortable to hold (I've had others that weren't) and I like how the straw is a softer material. The one downside is I have to refill the ice a couple of times a day bc it does melt. The water is still cold, though.",4
2/11/2024,I love my cup two bottles of water can fit and it's affordable. I will say it has encouraged me to drink at least 4 bottles of water a day,4
12/6/2023,"It's  not too heavy. I love the silicone straw.I love the twist top lid. Except it's not quite centered(like holding the handle). If I was just sipping it, it would get on my nerves. But since I use the straw it's not a bother.",4
2/18/2024,"kept a drink cold for 24 hours, still bits of ice inside. seems sturdy, handle.is hughenough it fits in my cup holder. The colors are vivid and dont blend as well as I was expecting, but at theendof the day its just a cup!",4

2/17/2024,"My only downside to this is it doesn't fit in the cup holder in my car. Like at all. But for the price it's a great cup, holds ice overnight and has seriously helped with my water intake.",4
2/10/2024,"Great size for cup, keeps drinks cold for hours. The straw could be better it came apart first hand wash. It has a removable piece impossible to reattach.",4
2/17/2024,"I love that I could put ice in it %26 24 hours later, the ice is still there!! My problem with this tumbler is that it is too big and too heavy. I just ordered a 24 oz tumbler.",4
2/2/2024,I like that it keeps the ice cold for a long time. I don't like that it is top heavy. I'm afraid that it will fall over on to my carpet next to my bed while I'm sleeping.,4
11/25/2023,"Want a GREAT dupe for those thermal cups named after a gentleman?  Here's my review

Pros: Arrived quicker than estimated delivery time %26 as pictured, no chips in coating.  Holds 40 oz. and keeps drinks ice cold for 6-8 hours before ice starts to melt.  Keeps hot drinks hot for 4-5 hours.  Fits in standard cup holders %26 is lightweight.
Cons:My sole criticism of this cup is the lid can stick and is difficult to screw and unscrew.  Even if your lid were to get stuck %26 you had to buy another, it'd still be well worth it as it's the same quality as that other brand for 1/3 of the price.",4
12/14/2023,I bought this as an affordable dupe and I'm so glad I did. The Ozark brand is a quality product. This tumbler holds my water cold for hours. It's sturdy but not too heavy. I love the handle option and the two opening options - straw or direct drink. Such a great tumbler!,4
11/10/2023,"This is my second ozark trail tumbler. I love the feeling of the outside of the cup, it's not glossy and it's just very different. Maybe matte or velvety. I love the silicone attachment on the straw. I always bite my straws and it's so much nicer on my teeth. Ice stays about half the day I think, and I haven't put it in the dishwasher. I was excited with this one, hoping it would hold ice longer but oh well. I still really love the cup!",4
11/17/2023,"I like this bottle. I've had several. This seems to be holding up well. It's sturdy and does well in the dishwasher. The only issue I have is the straw. It's plastic on the drinking end but doesn't have a way to seal it keep it from leaking or from getting inside the straw. Unless I'm missing a piece, but otherwise it's great. It's a little more expensive than I would have liked.",4
11/22/2023,"I originally ordered this on the pink/ white for myself to always have plenty of cold water on hand. I haven't really 7sed it for holt beverages. My don liked ot so much I got him this black one and he doesn't like ice but it still keeps his drinks cold. The only reason O took off 1 star is the straw. its 2/3 plastic and top is this odd silicone. . my son just doesn't use his but i got somewhat used to it but have ordered some plastic straws instead. But overall excellent quality. Do watch  the handle mine came loose when holding it while opening the lid, but not enough to damage it. Will probably buy more for small gifts",4
11/3/2023,"Paint already chipping after hand washing before first use. Needs an excessive amount of ice or it melts quickly. Does keep the drink cold but ice doesn't really last. Overall, for the price it isn't bad. Haven't knocked it over so no idea if it spills easily",4
1/2/2024,"There were a few tiny scratches I saw after taking it out of the box from shipping but, otherwise, it make a great teacher gift for my child's teacher.",4
1/21/2024,"I like this cup overall, but I wouldn't buy it again. The ice doesn't last super long, and the top of the straw collects lint and hair very bad. Just pay a few more dollars to get a better brand.",4
1/7/2024,Two things I don't like about this is the fact that there's a silicone straw extender. They should've made a taller straw AND make the twist opening easier to remove for cleaning.,4
1/17/2024,I have about 4 of these. I do not use a straw and these are perfect. Only problem they do leak from drinking home even when the twist cover is in.  Otherwise I just love them.,4
1/19/2024,"I have both brands. I love the outside of this one much better, almost feels rubbery. Love the flexible straw too!
The lid can be challenging to screw on. Overall 4.5 stars!",4
8/27/2023,Love this cup!! I have 3 different colors but I dropped one and broke the lid. I have tried calling Walmart and Ozark Trails to purchase a replacement but you can not order a lid or a straw. You can buy other sized lids for their other cups but not this one. Other than not being able to buy a replacement lid and straw this cup beats Stanley's cups out of the water!!!,4
9/19/2023,"The cup itself is GREAT! I use mine daily and rarely have to refill the ice, it lasts for so long. I can probably refill the cup at least 3 times before I have to put more ice in it, and it takes me about a day to go through that much water lol 

I only gave it a 4 star because my cup didn't get shipped with a straw so I had to wait a week before my order of straws came from Amazon.",4
7/24/2023,"The cold keeping power of the tumbler is great. There are only two things that earned a four star rating instead of a five star rating from me. The first is the fact that it arrived with a small dent and smudge on it from the package condition of the FedEx delivery. The second is the straw is the usual large hard plastic, but to compensate for the extra height of the tumbler, a rubberized piece has been added for length. I'm not sure if this will last without splitting. Overall, it is a quality piece.",4
8/10/2023,"LOVE this water bottle. Stays cold all day, ice doesn't melt, and it doesn't spill easily. Just as good as a Stanley imo. 4 stars, because the silicone attachment on the straw isn't ideal. It flattens when I drink through the straw. Otherwise, perfection!",4
8/2/2023,love the color and the handle on it. it does keep yhe drinks  cold holds ice well i can fill it ip with 12ice cubes and it lasts all day  this tumbler is better than the other one i got on isle h8 by a long shot and it wae cheaper i do wish the straw was. metal and longer,4
8/28/2023,"I'm obsessed with the color and that this particular cup fits in my cup holder unlike the Stanley. However I don't feel like the ice kept nearly as long as my Stanley. I use it for my 12hr indoor shifts and fill it to the brim with ice at the beginning of shift and by the end it's about 1/4 full. Not terrible but honestly expected more out of the brand. Past purchases have held up to top brands I've had. Over all, great for the price!",4
9/11/2023,"I love the volume it holds and that you don't have to refill as often. 
I would rate this cup 5 stars if ice lasted a bit longer. On the really hot days, even indoors, ice did not last 24 hours. I have not used it for hot drinks so I am I able to speak to how long it keeps drinks hot. 
For the price though, I'd recommend it.",4
7/2/2023,"Great dupe for “the cup”. I finally snagged one of these Ozark Trail 40oz tumblers online, but ultimately returned it. I think it was sturdy and very similar in design to the other brand, but 40oz was just too large. I keep hoping Ozark Trail will put out a 30oz tumbler now. Also, would like to see additional colors.",4
9/27/2023,Love this. Big enough to last a long time staying hot or cold. This last one was delivered with a broken lid but I called about it %26 received a discount. The kids are interchangeable so I wasn't too bothered because I have other lids. Makes me happy to try to do my part in causing less trash. Every little bit helps!,4
8/20/2023,"The cup holds a lot of liquid and keeps it cold all day in the Texas summer heat. The handle is nice, I like the grip and it's not slippery. Easy to clean. The only drawbacks are the lid, it's very difficult to put on and take off. Even once you get the threads aligned, the straw hole ends up off center, kind of annoying. The second drawback is that there's no foam on the bottom, to keep it from sliding around or getting scratches.",4
7/31/2023,"I purchased two of these for my daily use and love that they fit in my cup holders, hold 40oz, and the flexible stray is great.  The downsides are that it does spill out pretty easily, it doesn't keep the liquid cool for long periods of time, and the protective coating is scratching off.  I would still purchase again because of the value and convenience.",4
10/14/2023,"It is full stainless-steel construction, with a double cup to keep drinks hot or cold for longer. It is a larger cup capacity but the bottom is necked down to fit in “standard cup” holders.

It has very special options a screw-down lid with a rubber seal and a large plastic handle so ready for adventures or day-to-day activities.",4
8/7/2023,"Mine came pretty damaged and scratched up in the mail. The one I got from my grocery pick up was fine. 🤷🏻‍♀️ 
They keep my ice water really cold! But haven't used a Stanley to compare ? For the price difference it might be worth it. Wish they had more colors !",4
10/12/2023,"Love the cup, just as good as the pricier ones. Only issue is that the matte coating on the cup came damaged and peeling off, I chalked it up as it is what it is but it's definitely annoying and will only get worse over time. Cosmetically it's annoying but the cup is amazing otherwise",4
8/5/2023,"This tumbler is great! The handle is more comfortable than the expensive brand one I have. It keeps things cold just as well tho. My only complaint is the straw. I wish it had a completely hard straw instead of the two piece hard/silicone that comes with it. Overall, I highly recommend it!",4
8/13/2023,"The cup is amazing and keeps drinks cold and I love it. However, it can be challenging to screw the lid on and I think due to that the lid is breakable. Already broke one unfortunately and there doesn't seem to be the option yet to buy a replacement lid only.",4
2/16/2024,The tumbler is very nice and seems to be well made but the straw is missing and I had to buy one to replace it.,4
2/20/2024,"Looks nice, sturdy, good for the price but does not have the insulation to keep things cold like Stanley or Yeti or some other brands",4
2/18/2024,I absolutely love all 3 of the ozark tumblers I've purchased. But the last one did not have a straw and I can't find just the straw for sale.,4
2/9/2024,"Only complaint I have is that it is hard to pull out of my cup holders due to the matte like texturing on the cup, I think.",4
2/15/2024,"Great tumbler good value but the staw is kinda wierd, need to change for a different one.  Like you are drinking out of a hose, strange.",4
11/13/2023,"I love the design, the color and the size of this cup. It does keep my drink cold for a while however, not as long as other cups have there is a good to keep most of it. Cool for most of the day?yes. And for $20 you can't go wrong.",4
12/8/2023,It states that hot drinks stay hot for 6 hours but that's cap. More like three hours but other than that durability is great. I never used the straw but nice addition to the product. Hand wash if you don't want peeling.,4
11/6/2023,Love this cup. keeps my drinks very cold. the outside finish began to peel a bit after using it every day form months but still worked great. Ice stayed cold even overnight!,4
12/8/2023,Ice melts extremely slowly. Most people will like that but I like mine to melt so I get more water to drink. Weird quirk of mine.  Cup is pretty tall too and heavy duty. I'm sure it will last the rest of my life if the lid lasts.,4
12/5/2023,"I really love this cup, easy to hold, light weight for the amount of ounces, but it scratches so easily. The coating is silky coating. It keeps ice melted for about 24 hours maybe.",4
11/30/2023,"This is just like a Stanley cup but I like it better because of the colors.  Be beware it is really heavy once you have liquid in it, but that's the case no matter what tumbler you would use.  Keeps liquid cold for me too for at least 12 hours.",4
8/21/2023,love how it looks super similar to a stanley which i didn't want to pay full price for but it's not really leak proof,4
1/17/2024,"I love the color and it does keep my hot coffee fairly warm all day, however, its not really made to drink out of it without the straw.",4
1/15/2024,"It doesn't keep ice frozen as long as I hoped it was, but it's come in very handy during recovery from surgery.",4
12/30/2023,"I liked the size, that it had a handle. Keeps my beverage cold. Disliked that it is top heavy and tips over easily.",4
1/17/2024,"Bought it for my grandma for her birthday and she loves it!! Uses it everyday and always keeps her water cool, just like she likes it.",4
9/8/2023,Cold drinks stay cold for a very long time. The only downfall I think this product has is that the liquid leaks out of the top if it tips over. It would be nice to have a seal around the straw.,4
10/17/2023,It's definitely not a leading brand that's 3xs as much. Keeps ice and water cold. Threw out the ridiculous silicone straw that came with the cup and replaced it. All in all the cup is good.,4
10/9/2023,"The cup is heavy, could be a weapon in a pinch. The ice stays frozen about half of the day. I'm not sure why the straw is short, you have to dig it out. Maybe I got the wrong size sent with the 40 ounce cup.",4
7/21/2023,Very pretty. I like the soft silicone top straw. It doesn't actually stay cold as long as my other Ozark trail tumblers though. It's also not spill proof at all. I have other tumblers that other than the straw are pretty air tight,4
7/4/2023,"Besides the handle breaking off I love this tumbler. Debating exchanging because it fits my cupholder and the purple color is as pictured. Also, easy to clean.",4
7/25/2023,"Keeps water cold, fits in cup holder in car and at gyms. I don't like the silicone straw attachment and have to order a plastic replacement. Overall is a cost friendly Stanley dupe that is great.",4
10/23/2023,this doesn't have a metal handle like my Stanley but keeps my drink cold like it for half the price. I prefer this silcon straw and I wasn't sure if I would. You really will enjoy this.,4
7/2/2023,"Good cup, but the straw was a no for me. The tip is flexible and I didn't like it. I had to order straws on Amazon.  Other tgan that it's a great Stanley dupe!",4
7/21/2023,This thing can hold a ton of water. Perfect to take to work. The only down side is that over time the lid does not screw on properly. The hole where the straw goes is close to the handle. Otherwise it's good quality for a great price.,4
7/17/2023,"I really like this cup. Unfortunately it did not come with the black straw as advertised, it came with a white straw. I prefer the look of the black straw.",4
8/4/2023,keeps it cold! i like the cup a lot except that it is VERY tall and a little tough to hold from the handle but overall it's great i use it daily for my massive ices coffees.,4
7/26/2023,Love the tumbler but it was delivered in a bag with the straw sticking up so I accidentally cut the end off the straw when I opened it.  Not as nice as the original but a good dupe.,4
10/20/2023,These cups are good for the price. They keep drinks cold for sure. The matte finish makes stains appear easily and the handles will come loose at the slightest drop.,4
10/2/2023,This is a great cup. The only complaint I have is it's not leak proof. The top could use a redesign to prevent this and it would be 5 star perfect! But I wouldn't let that keep me from purchasing it. Just don't knock it over. Haha,4
8/5/2023,"It doesn't save ice very well but keeps drinks cold for a long time. Downfall is that it can/will spill if you accidentally tip it over, even the slightest bit. Amazing color and very trendy.",4
8/24/2023,"It keeps things cold, Like every vacuum tumbler.  The handle is screwed on, so it's not the best, and the lid needs quite a few turns before being secure. But it's a good cup.",4
8/6/2023,It's okay for the price if you're too cheap for a Stanley. Dislike how there's an opening for sipping under the straw opening that doesn't seal completely.,4
9/13/2023,Perfect dupe!  May not be as insulated as the original but works perfectly for me which is why 4 stars instead of 5. I drink the water so fast that it doesn't need to stay cold for 48 hours. It stays cold overnight which is good enough for me.,4
8/2/2023,This seems like a nice dupe cup! Only thing i could complain about is that the handle seems loose when you take the lid off. Otherwise a great cup %26 will use for a long time.,4
9/10/2023,"Keeps my water cool. Great size. Easy to carry. Sometimes is not easy to close or open.  Besides that, I recommend it for the value of it. Less expensive than many others.",4
7/19/2023,I love the cup but the lid has to screw on certain way putting the straw at the end as opposed to middle of the cup.   Awkward with handle.   Also straw too floppy,4
8/25/2023,"Pretty great cup. Well insulated. I'm not a big fan of the exposed screw heads on the underside of the handle... looks like something that's going to rust pretty easily, so now I need to make sure they don't stay wet.",4
8/26/2023,"Would have given it 5 stars but mine came dented on the bottom, preventing it from sitting upright without wobbling. I was able to hammer the dent out but now it's ugly. That being said, keeps ice for DAYS.",4
6/24/2023,Cup is very nice and the colors are beautiful. Ice stays frozen for about 14 hours for me. I don't care too much for the lid. It twists on and depending on where you start to twist is where it ends up for you to sip from. It doesn't always twist on well. I also don't like the straw. I will replace it will with a full sturdy silicone one. This one is flimsy for the top 1/3 of the straw. Needed a “cheaper than the trendy cup” that fits in my cup holder for an upcoming trip and this will work once I get a new straw.,4
4/8/2023,"I'm pretty pleased with this tumbler. It absolutely keeps drinks cold for a very long time! Plus, you can't beat the price. The only downfall is the lid. It is NOT leakproof like many similar tumblers. The seal is fine around the lid but liquid leaks out from under the slider that covers the straw hole when not in use. I'd give this 5 stars if it weren't for that. Please think about upgrading the lid.",4
5/28/2023,"I love the color,  the way that it feels, and the fact that it holds a lot of water while still fitting in cup holders. That said, the buying process was a pain. I originally bought it weeks ago and that order was eventually cancelled because they ran out of stock. Then I ordered it again and after that order got delayed I was afraid it would also be cancelled, but it finally arrived a couple of weeks later. The cup came with a dent on the bottom so it is pretty wobbly, but with how long it took to get I don't want to exchange it and have to wait even longer to have a cup that I can use.",4
6/8/2023,"Curious as to why the $5 price jump out of nowhere. These are good cups, but they're not Stanley, so why are they now over $20(w/tax)??? Walmart is upping prices on more and more different items, and shrinking sizes, more than many retailers lately, and it's disgusting.",4
6/19/2023,"I purchased 2 of these cups for me and my friend while I was visiting his house...wanted to cheaper option to the Stanley tumbler. Cup keeps water cold, even without ice but the lid can be difficult to screw on and the straw is HORRIBLE...hate the silicone cap on the straw; hence, the 4 stars.",4
3/11/2023,"Don’t love the straw, but I ordered a replacement for the Stanley cups and it fits just fine. I think the idea behind the silicone extender was to prevent leaking from the top. But I’d rather a solid plastic straw. Also, it’s set up to line up with a lefty. So if you hold a cup in your right hand, the straw will be on the opposite side of the cup and if you hold it in your left hand, it will be closest to you, which kind of threw me off but not a big deal. Overall good insulation that holds ice.",4
2/3/2024,Great item but too large for ice maker and to hold.,4
1/30/2024,good brand. lerps things cold for a very long time.,4
1/28/2024,wish it had a little stopper on the straw to close it.,4
1/31/2024,Love the color and price.  Does not keep ice as ong as I expected but does a decent job.,4
2/8/2024,Missing the plastic part of the straw but other than that I have liked it,4
2/9/2024,Top is hard to get on. Threads don't always line up. Keeps drinks cold just like Stanley cups.,4
2/1/2024,Loved how long my water stays cold,4
1/29/2024,Good for drinking lots of water. Drinks stay cold all day. Great price.,4
2/6/2024,The tumbler is good. Except the ice doesn't last as long as they claim it too.,4
2/16/2024,"Keeps cold. Handle snugs up to cup, soft feel. Just wish straw was smaller.",4
2/8/2024,"doesnt keep ice as long as stanley, but great value",4
11/21/2023,Love this cup. Keeps water cold and helps me to drink more. Doesn't spill and easy to drink out of the straw.,4
12/11/2023,"Almost perfect! I love it keeps my drinks cold. It doesn't fit in my car cup holder, but enough where it's just tilted not falling over.",4
10/29/2023,"Color of amazing, when I took the label off it was slightly brighter where the label was. Will have to see if the color evens out.",4
10/29/2023,bought this as a gift as I bought myself one back in march and love it. sad the price went up $5 since then but friend loved it and th3 pink color.,4
12/10/2023,"Only issue I have with this is that it isn't leak proof. It's not a deal breaker, but would make things easier.",4
10/14/2023,"Keeps drink cold
Takes several hours for ice to melt 
Does spill",4
1/11/2024,Love these. Especially for the price!!,4
1/1/2024,"Love the cup, hate the straw",4
1/2/2024,These made some great Dirty Santa gifts for Christmas,4
1/14/2024,Great cup! Keeps ice for hours. Comfortable to hold,4
12/30/2023,Works just like Stanley but paint is kinda cheap. Gets the job done!,4
1/2/2024,My sister in law loved her cup so she could measure her water intake better and keep it cold.,4
1/7/2024,I wish the straw was one piece and that the top of the straw wasn't a flimsy plastic.,4
1/7/2024,it keeps everything cold and lasts all day!,4
1/1/2024,"Great quality cup, keeps drinks cold",4
7/9/2023,Keeps ice cold for long! A month ago these were 14.97 then they went UP in price to 19 bucks due to popularity!!!  Bring the price back down!!,4
8/8/2023,it looks sturdy! wish it has a brush for the straw for cleaning. now i have yo buy one just for this straw,4
8/5/2023,Love that it holds a lot of water while also fitting in my cup holder. The lid gets tough to take off and the seal on the lid twist sometimes,4
8/25/2023,"Great size that lasts me through my entire work day. Durable with a sturdy, comfortable grip handle. Keeps drink cold/ice for 12  hours.",4
9/17/2023,"Good cup. I like that the top of the straw is flexible, but the straw is too big, I feel like I'm swallowing a bunch of air.",4
8/28/2023,very comparable to the big brands. doesn't keep ice for 24 hrs but it does for about 8 hrs so I'm happy with it plus it's pretty!,4
10/7/2023,"The cup itself is great, don't like the straw as much because it tends to hold onto the taste of whatever was in there before",4
10/23/2023,Love it! Just wish the straw was solid plastic all the way up- I don't care for the silicon top on the straw.,4
9/6/2023,love these cups im in a walker and i can hold on to the handle and it wont spill keeps the drings great and  cold,4
7/28/2023,"I really like it, works well. The only draw back I have is the handle is loose after less than a month of use.",4
8/28/2023,I love the color of this tumbler. It doesn't keep ice in tumbler for as long as Stanley or yeti. But for the price it's very good.,4
8/13/2023,Fits in cup holder nicely.  Keeps cold.   Lid could be more versatile like the Stanley. But otherwise great tumbler.,4
8/6/2023,Good value for the money.  The ice does melt overnight but the water stays cold. I do love the colors though.,4
7/6/2023,"Works OK. If you use the straw, it's sometimes hard to suck through it because of the seal that the straw makes.",4
7/6/2023,Why is the straw so long?? I get being long enough to reach the bottom but then it sticks up a good 4-5 inches over the top!,4
9/18/2023,It's a great dupe. I've gotten lots of compliments on it. Works great. The lid closes at a bit of an awkward place but it's fine.,4
7/28/2023,I've loved this! Keeps my drinks very cold. Only downside is the paint has started to come off on the bottom.,4
8/7/2023,"purchased two of these and noticed that the straw has a crack at the top where it seals on both, i would still purchase again and didn't return them.",4
9/26/2023,Keeps my ice all day long however it does leak.. I love the colors they offer also I will be getting more,4
7/18/2023,"Really cute, holds ice well.  Although it is pretty big and heavy, not lightweight like the Tervis cups.",4
7/24/2023,"The cup was pretty, I returned because it was too large and heavy for me, also the lid didn't fit properly",4
10/10/2023,"It's a great cup, nice capacity, love the handles and the screw on lid,! For someone like me, a klutz, it's fantastic cup!",4
7/23/2023,Keeps ice for most of the day. Great flexible straw design with riding in cup and flexible outside of cup.,4
7/11/2023,I love the handle but I hate the straw and lid. so I changed it out with  1 of my other cups lids.  will definitely be buying a few more,4
8/28/2023,Good tumbler. A tad tall for my husband and he doesn't like the bendable plastic straw. Otherwise does the job.,4
8/7/2023,"I love this! Keeps my water cold, doesn't spill when tipped, great straw. Retuned my Stanley cup and kept this one.",4
8/9/2023,It keeps your drink cold and ice doesn't melt very fast. The lid is a pain in the butt! Hard to put on and take off at times.,4
8/2/2023,Not a fan of the silicone straw and the paint chipped at the top of rim of the cup other than that it's a good dupe.,4
7/26/2023,Great cup for car cup holder and keeping drinks cold.  The cup does leak if it tips over or traveling in backpack.,4
4/22/2023,"Love the cup, super cute. Holds ice well. That said, it's really difficult to get the straw/lid to line up correctly based on where you want it. It's always not centered.",4
4/9/2023,I bought two of these. One for my daughter and one for me. They are big and I really liked them I got the purple ones. I would recommend buying these.,4
6/3/2023,Great name brand dupe. Keeps water cold on hot days! The straw is silicon at the top. The handle feels a little less robust and stable than the name brand but for 1/3 the price I guess that's ok.,4
6/3/2023,"not a fan of the straw, but love the color and price and it seems to be just as good as my Stanley Cups.  i received it by delivery same day even though I had requested shipping, so that was a pleasant surprise.",4
5/28/2023,"Plus: perfect car cup!! large capacity, dishwasher safe, ice still in the cup after 12 hours, Fits in car cup holders. 
Con: falls over more easily in carpet or grass and lawn chair cup holder.",4
6/19/2023,"Great cup, holds a lot of water and keep it cold for hours, even without ice. My only complaints are the top is slightly difficulty to screw on and I absolutely HATE the straw...the two portion is silicone (which is the 4 stars).",4
4/12/2023,Great dupe for the overpriced Stanley tumbler. Highly recommend. Took off a star bc the lid is hard to open but other than that it’s great. Lavender color is very pretty!,4
11/4/2023,i always trust this brand. this is my new favorite water tumbler,4
12/24/2023,Like but straw is too short,4
11/8/2023,"a little bulky, but very good at handling day to day use",4
12/19/2023,It's a Christmas present but it looks like it's made very nice,4
12/14/2023,I like the cup. It is nice looking and easy to use. Just doesn't keep ice very long.,4
11/21/2023,"I don't like that the straw is bendy. Otherwise, perfect!",4
11/17/2023,"I do like the cup, not as cool as a Stanley but 1/3 the price.",4
11/6/2023,Best 40 ounce cup! Keeps ice cold drinks at freezing cold temperature for many hours.,4
11/29/2023,"keeps water cold forever.
wish it came in 30oz, sorta big",4
11/12/2023,Keeps drinks cold for good amount of time but the color fades after a month or so.,4
12/3/2023,"it's a great cup, but not the color i thought i was getting!",4
12/26/2023,The cup is as pictured but I'm a little disappointed that the straw wasn't included.,4

8/20/2023,Does not keep cold as long as my other ozark trail cups,4
7/23/2023,"cost effective, exactly like Stanley.  works great.",4

8/26/2023,Holds a lot. Leaks a little if knocked over,4
7/27/2023,Nice! Keeps drinks cold works as well as it's more expensive competitors.,4
8/19/2023,Keeps beverages cold for a long time. I like the bendy straw.,4

7/31/2023,Wish it had a rubber/no skid type thing on the bottom.,4
7/24/2023,"I like this. Only downside, I would change the straw",4

9/29/2023,It's a insulated cup that holds drink what else you want me to say cold or hot 👍,4
7/18/2023,Great! So great my neighbor stole it off my porch.,4
6/30/2023,Super cute cup and its big! but handle broke shortly after purchase. return was easy!,4
8/3/2023,Kris drinks cold and fits in car cup holder,4
8/13/2023,The cup does not stay as cold as it should be and ice melt to fast,4
7/5/2023,For the price it's outstanding. Just wish it held ice a little better,4
8/29/2023,This is my everyday cup for work and home it keeps my water cold all day into the next.,4
8/2/2023,I wasn't a fan of the straw. that's a personal choice,4
7/20/2023,Love the size of the cup and keeps my drink cold most of the day,4
10/14/2023,i love the screw lid! this cup is perfect for the car and at the gym! keeps cold for a long time.,4
9/20/2023,Holds ice really well and fits in my cup holder! Love the straw too,4
7/19/2023,Keeps ice for days. A bit heavy but good,4
8/19/2023,bigger than what I thought from the photo. but stays cold!,4
3/14/2023,"100% Satisfied. works just as good as my Stanley Quencher, and my Simple Modern Trek. However, the straw situation is weird. 2/3 plastic and 1/3 silicone extender, that is tough to remove to clean. I tossed the it and used the straw from one of my others. Overall I highly recommend this, just get different straws for it. I got white because it was all my store had, but I plan on getting other colors!",5
3/8/2023,Good item holds a lot of water came in handy the past few days we had some high temperatures and I was able to keep my water cold for more than six hours outside I love the color and it fits in my lunch box I like that the straw is so long it goes all the way to the bottom of the mug the outside of the mug never sweats it also kept my coffee hot on a one and a half hour drive with no spills great item would recommend to friends,5
2/1/2024,"This cup is a gorgeous purple. My daughter got it as an early Valentine's Day gift. She put some jack %26 sally stickers on it and it looks like it was made that way! Sooo cute! It is rather large but it encourages her to drink her water at a fraction of the cost for a Stanley. Oh, and zero lead 👍🏼",5
1/31/2024,"I love this tumbler and I have 40 oz Yetis and Stanley tumblers.  For this price, you can't beat this Ozark tumbler. I conducted an ice test on all three of these tumblers and even though the Stanley held ice SLIGHTLY longer, it was a tight race between the three.  The Ozark can hold its own against the mighty Stanley and Yeti!",5
4/29/2023,"This cup is perfect. The handle. The tapered bottom that fits in car cup holders. THE COLOR! Who else has been obsessed with lavender purple? My most favorite thing about this cup though? Well obviously the silicone straw. I can't tell you how many times metal straws hit my teeth very hard. Now in the middle of the night when I need water, I don't almost chop a tooth. Also your beverage will stay cold for a good long while. I think I had some last almost 2 days and I don't put too much ice. I like that the outside doesn't get condensation!",5
3/16/2023,"I found the ozark trail version before I was able to get my hands on a Stanley.   The ONLY difference is the OT cup doesn’t have the rubber grips on the handle and the top of the lid….and the straw has a silicone extender (which I prefer because I can kind of chew on it).
As far as being sturdy and keeping your drink cold/hot…they’re the exact same thing.  Same size.  Same everything
It’s a great dupe!",5
1/23/2024,"Under $20 %26 as hot pink as can be. Ozark is just as good if not better than any cup you gotta wait in line for %26 I didn't pay $200-400 cup. Ordered from the warmth of my house,  delivered to my front door. I did order a different lid, Ozark 40 oz magnetic lid and it fit perfectly. Ordered a few more in different colors. Thank you, Walmart",5
1/7/2024,"I love the way it was packaged and the little Ozark trail emblem in the straw. 
I haven't tried it with ice but I poured soda out of the fridge and it was still cold at least an hour later. And the seal is good so it did well not letting the soda become flat. 
I'm very happy with it. Love the handle and straw and feel of the coating on the outside.",5
1/12/2024,"I love this cup! It looks absolutely ridiculous and I hate the trend, but it works to help you drink a lot of water. I can only carry it in my jeep, this is a HUGE cup! Had a friend laser mine to customize it. What I like more about this one than the trendy original is the straw, it's soft on the outside and hard on the inside. It just works well, and I like mine more than my girlfriend's $70 cup. Buy it!",5
1/15/2024,"Decided to jump on the “pink tumbler bandwagon”, but didn't want to put on my boxing gloves or go broke buying another well known brand. I came across this on the website (Walmart) and ordered it. Very happy with it. Keeps my drinks cold all day (and night!) for half the price. The color is gorgeous. Would definitely recommend!",5
1/31/2024,Ozark Tumbler keeps your drinks colder hours longer than the Stanley plus I tested the lead in each one and the Stanley contains lead and Ozark does not! I love the color Hot Pink! Suites me well.,5
1/28/2024,"i needed to keep a water cup by me at night, for taking medicine and night drink. i am now able to make my water intake goal. it also has good handle grips. that what caught my attention as well as the price (19.97 vs Stanley 45.00).",5
2/11/2024,"This thing is HUGE, so just a warning. It took an adjustment period but I love it and am considering ordering another in a different color. Keeps my ice water cold throughout the night and on long days.",5
2/3/2024,"I absolutely love this cup. I have a Stanley, but this cup is by far my favorite. The things I like about it is the size, that hot pink color and the price was perfect.",5
2/4/2024,It's definitely as good as Stanley cup. Very strong and durable. Extremely well made. Not a cheap one like at some of these store. You will love this one. I bought everybody in my family one,5
2/2/2024,This tumbler I guess you could say is very nice and very sturdy. The straw is easy to use and soft not hard like others are. The color is nice and it keeps my drink fresh and cold all day long. A great buy!,5
12/20/2023,"Love my Ozark cup. I don't use the straw for medical reasons-so the only thing I don't like is it's hard to get the lid on right to line up with the way you hold it. Does leak from the drink openings, not the part where lid screws on. But  that's expected from most cups.",5
1/11/2024,"Love this cup. It keeps my drink cold all day. It makes drinking water more enjoyable. I love that the straw is flexible on top, but plastic on the bottom so that you can stir your drink.",5
1/9/2024,Placed an order for tumbler on a Friday. Shipment was received by Monday. Package received with no damages. I love the quality and new Hot pink color!! This price definitely beats the price of a Stanley!! Love it 💖,5
1/22/2024,"This cup is amazing! Keeps my drinks cold and is much more affordable than the popular brand that people are fighting over! And for the price, I'd buy so many more!!",5
1/20/2024,I like the fact that it's the bigger size. it's perfect for me I usually just drink cold drinks and I put ice in it most times. I would recommend it to everyone five stars.,5
1/25/2024,Forget that expensive tumbler everyone else buys this one checks the box for everything you need and the hot pink color is everything!!! I love this and everyone comments on it when I take it in public.,5
1/13/2024,"I love this tumbler! Especially the color and the straw how soft is so soothing when drinking such a pleasant feeling. 
The next best thing is how long the beverages stay cold! It stays cold at least 24 hours! 

I love this product!",5
2/27/2023,"My husband loves his new insulated mug!! Especially the comfortable handle. It holds a lot and is heavy so for an elder person, the handle is great!! He'll use it mainly when he plays golf to keep his ice water cold. We tried it out and still had ice in it the next day! Highly recommend!",5
2/23/2023,This is huge!! I love the look and feel to this! It feels and looks like high quality. I was impressed woth the craftsmanship. This one is 40oz and has a base that was designed to fit in a standard car cup holder. And it came woth its own silicone reusable straw!,5
2/23/2023,"The 40 ounce double-wall, vacuum-sealed stainless steel tumbler by Ozark Trail is my favorite everyday tumbler. It comes in a vary of colors and I chose white. I love that I can use this tumbler for hot or cold drinks, basically all year round! I'm currently using this for iced water to increase my water intake, especially for the summer months coming ahead! Love the shatter-proof and dishwasher-safe lid and drinking straw! Easy to clean and would recommend!",5
2/26/2023,I really like the huge insulted timber/cup. It keeps the ice pretty well for 5/6 hours though it does melt down some. I feel it works better for hot drinks but they do become luke warm. It is so tall they have a rubber extension on the included straw. I use it daily. It's also a pretty pale lavender color which I love.,5
2/25/2023,"My husband is obsessed! He has been bragging how the same ice has been in his cup for two days. He jus keeps adding water. He wasn't sure about the flimsy straw but now prefers it. It's easy to clean. Holds a lot and fits in an average cup holder! 
We went on a Boy Scout adventure and this cup was perfect for holding a big drink through the day. No stopping to buy a drink. I love finding things that are a great buy! I need one for everyone!! What a perfect gift these will be :)",5
2/26/2023,"I have several of this brand of stainless steel drinkware and have never once been let down by quality or function of any of them. 
This will be my new tea and water glass for the summer while working around the house doing yard work and in the car doing one of our many overnighters and day trips to relax after several days of yardwork.
Its well insulated to keep cold stuff cold or hot stuff hot for a good long time.
The lid screws on and can be positioned to use the included straw with the soft silicone very bendy end that makes it easier to take a drink from the large tumbler, or closed once the straw has been removed. 
Unlike some stainless insulated drinkware this is dishwasher safe",5
2/23/2023,This 40 oz mug with built in straw is the absolute best for on my desk. It gives me adequate water during my work shift. It's well made and does not leave condensation on my paperwork. Very well insulated. I am completely satisfied and will definitely be buying more.,5
2/24/2023,"This 40oz tumbler is amazing, it has a see trough lid to see the inside without opening the lid, sturdy and kind of un breakable straw, easy to clean, the bottom can fit in car cup holders but what I like the most of it is the handle because once full can be heavy and would be hard to hold a simple grip with your hands, this will be my favorite tumbler now on",5
2/26/2023,"This goes well with my lifestyle these days. The Ozark Trail tumbler has a massive 40 oz. capacity with a heavy duty handle and screw on lid. The straw is a hybrid of part-sturdy plastic on the bottom and part-bendy (what feels like) silicone on top. The inside is vacuum insulated stainless steel, so it keeps my drink nice and cold for the entire time I'm enjoying it and without any condensation on the outside since it's doubled walled. It's BPA-free and top-rack dishwasher safe!!! It is perfect for my morning iced latte and the best part is I can fit it right in my car cupholder for a fresh cup to go. When I'm done with my iced latte, I just give it a quick rinse and refill it with ice water that stays cold all day. I absolutely love this ...",5
2/25/2023,"Super large travel cup that can be used with a straw (that comes with it) or without. The lid is what really makes this cup useful for me. When you turn the lid it has an opening specifically made for the straw, when you turn it again it has an opening that is bigger to use without a straw, and then when you turn it one more time it seals the opening to keep liquid from leaking. I use this for both my ice coffee and hot coffee.",5
2/22/2023,"This Ozark Trail 40oz tumbler with handle is huge. It will definitely get used a lot during the hot and humid days of summer we have here in the south. This Ozark Trail Matt black tumbler is stainless steel and double vacuum insulated to keep your beverages cold or hot for hours. Its tapered bottom fits nicely in my cars cup holder and I like that it has a handle that prevents it from slipping out of my hand or accidentally dropping it. The removable lid has two openings. One for the included straw and a wider opening to drink from. The tumbler is BPA free and is top rack dishwasher safe. The tumbler boast a ""sweat free"" design and lifetime warranty. I’m familiar with Ozark Trail products and have always found their products to be reliable ...",5
2/27/2023,I received this 40Oz Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel Tumbler-Blue for free in exchange for my opinion. This is one huge cup! It keeps hot beverages hot and cold ones cold! I love that it's stainless steel. It's easy and convenient for me to use! Great cup!!,5
2/23/2023,"The quality of Ozark brand tumblers meets or exceeds any other. Durable, attractive matte black finish, ergonomic handle, screw on lid, keeps your hot/cold beverages how you want them. The straw (while it probably won't outlast a stainless steel mug) is very durable, doesn't crack in cleaning, and comes with a 4"" silicone tip. There is no flap to close the lid, only a round hole for the straw. The lid doesn't leak even in bumpy driving, unless you turn the whole mug upside down. My other Ozark mugs hold about 20 ounces so this one is BIG. In my small car, it's a little too tall and lid too wide to fit comfortably in the center console cupholder because the straw hits the dashboard. It's perfect for a larger vehicle especially when you need ...",5
2/26/2023,"This tumbler is double-wall vacuum insulated and it works very well to keep my drink cold in hot days and hot in cold days. It comes with a plastic twist lid and the opening can be controlled to be open, close, or circle shape (for straws). It features a built-in handle and it's comfortable to hold even when 
 the tumbler is full (max capacity is 40oz, ~1.2L, which is a little heavy). The tumbler design fits my car's cup holder perfectly and I love using this tumbler when we're on road trip. It's also very easy to clean this tumbler as it's dish-washer top rack safe.",5
2/22/2023,"The label came off easily. It is double-wall vacuum insulated, sweat free, BPA free, top rack dishwasher safe, and lifetime warranty.  The handle is part of the tumbler and has finger notches so when you pick it up your fingers fit the handle.  My coffee stayed hot for 1 1/2 hrs.  With a mug, I would have to put it in the microwave several times to reheat it.  I poured water from two 16.9 oz. refrigerated bottles and it kept the water icy cold for over 8 hrs. The lid screws off and has 3 adjustments, one for the straw, one for a larger hole to drink from the tumbler, and one for closing the opening.  An insert describing the lid adjustments would be helpful.   It also fits in the car cup holder.",5
9/12/2023,"I am SHOCKED with how awesome this cup is. I desperately needed a cup to hold cold water after I returned back to work and the air didn't work. This cup went 24 hours keeping the original ice cold. Even when it is really warm out (or warm IN, in my case), the ice still lasts about 12 hours. I love the straw because it is soft and flexible at the top, so I can drink easily from any angle. I HIGHLY recommend it.",5
3/2/2023,"This review is for the ozark trail 40 ounce stainless steel purple tumbler . This tumbler is so sturdy and made heavy to keep your drink hot or cold all day . It's great to take along on walks, or hiking or on long road trips to keep you hydrated and refreshed . it really does hold a lot of whatever is your prefered drink. It has a sturdy handle and a recloseable lid to keep your drink from  spilling. This tumbler has become my new favorite to keep by  my bedside at night to drink my daily amount of water. And better yet it's purple my favorite color . Also it is easy to wash just use hot soapy water.",5
2/28/2023,The tumbler is substantial in size!  Matte paint with 3 transitional tropical colors. Kind of has an 80's vibe. Surface isn't entirely slip proof but much better than a glossy finish.  Kept my beverages at desired temps for over an hour.  Fits perfect in my SUV's cup holder.  Since the lower part of the tumbler is smaller in diameter it's somewhat top heavy. It's best to put it in a vehicle cup holder and possibly a camping chair's cup holder too.  My 19 yr old son asked to use it-he was impressed with how much coffee it can hold.,5
7/19/2023,"The cup itself is beautiful %26 BIG! I can fill it up with ice %26 water at night %26 it's still cold in the morning. The lid is a twist on which, to me, is great. I have a 2 year old who likes to get ahold of my cups %26 she has spilt my cups that have the lids that just pop on. My only issue was the delivery. It was literally just the cup in a mail plastic bag. I'm surprised it wasn't dented or scratched up. It got here in perfect shape.",5
9/29/2023,"This cup is pretty amazing. As good as the expensive brand name cup. It will keep ice for 24 hours. I haven't tried using it for hot liquids yet. I love that it fits in the cupholder in my car, I chose the rose gold color, it's more of a pinkish lavender color I don't really see any gold, but it's a pleasant color. I love that it has a unique finish, hard to explain, and it doesn't sweat. This is the best cup I have ever used the handle is so convenient, I'll never buy any other cup.",5
1/13/2024,Ive always owned Yeti cups. This cup is just as good if not better than the Yeti. I love it and will plan to buy this brand in the future.,5
1/18/2024,I love this cup and straw.  The straw is flexible and works great.  The color is beautiful pinkish gold.  I use it everyday.,5
1/20/2024,I am so happy with this purchase!! It keeps ice frozen over 24 hours. Super easy to clean. Very tough and great colors!!,5
8/3/2023,I love the colors of the cup! It does keep ice well unless you leave it in the car for long periods of time in the 90 degree weather but the drink still feels cold! Definitely love this cup!!!!! Great Stanley DUPE!,5
6/30/2023,"The fact that this fits perfectly in every cup holder I've used it in is why I now own multiples of these cups. The handles are comfortable to carry, they keep your ice from melting quickly which in the summer heat of the south is a necessity.",5
9/30/2023,I keep seeing people with the Stanley brand everywhere I turn but I'm not spending that kind of money on a cup. I was excited to see these for $19.99 at Wally World. Keeps my drink cold. Comes with a nice straw and the pink is absolutely beautiful.,5
8/18/2023,This is the second one I purchased. The cup holds ice 1 day longer that the Stanley and the straw on this cup is way better. I am in love with this cup and use it daily.,5
7/21/2023,Fits in any cup holder. Keeps my tea piping hot for at least three hours still warm after twelve hours. Has straw and can switch to a sipping spout. Love the lavender color and the giant size.,5
3/4/2023,This is my favorite mug! The base is tapered to fit in the cup holders of my car and there is absolutely plenty of room for all of my ice and filtered water. My favorite aspect of this is the little rubber edition/extension of the straw. He gives extra reach plus a very pleasant rubbery feeling versus the stiff plastic for my straw use.,5
3/5/2023,"This tumbler is just lovely.  
The colors make me so happy. There is peach, pastel yellow bubly pink and Caribbean blue.  I swear it makes me want to drink more water. 
It keeps cold water very well, I was able to sip for hours and not worry about it getting warm. This will work very well during summer. I also tested hot tea and found that I had to open the cover to get it warm enough to drink. Speaking of which I love that I can see through the top. 
The size also makes it easy for getting in my daily hydration needs. Also the bottom part is slimmer so it can fit in most cup holders making it easy to travel with. 
This tumbler is a plus for me and I highly recommend it.",5
3/2/2023,"The Ozark Trail 40 ounce insulated stainless steel tumbler is such an amazing cup for such a great value!  I fill it up in the morning and still have ice left in it in late afternoon. I don't drink hot beverages but I assume it would have the same success in keeping a hot drink warm.  It holds a good amount of liquid so I'm sure to get my daily water in.  I love the handle, straw (straws just make me drink more water!) and the lavender color as well.  I was honestly shocked when I saw the price point on this one.  One of its primary competitors is 3-4x the price of this one but the Ozark Trail one is every bit as good!  Highly recommend!   



double wall stainless steel tumbler will keep you hydrated all day long with less refill. With a 4...",5
3/4/2023,"I absolutely love this cup! It holds a lot so you aren't having to refilll all the time. It really keeps your drink cold too. The construction is great and it is high quality. I thought it might be top heavy but it's not, the handle is balanced just right. The lavender color is really pretty too.",5
3/4/2023,"This 40Oz Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel Tumbler-Blue is nice quality.  It feels durable & can hold a lot of beverage, both hot & cold.  I like the matte silicone feel of it, which is unique & makes it easier to grip.  The handle is a sturdy plastic & has finger grooves to hold it comfortably.  It also has the Ozark Trail emblem embossed on it which is cool.  I like that the lid on this twists on which keeps the lid on in case it tips over.  However it is hard getting it twisted on so that the spout lines up to my mouth.  The insulation keeps my water cold & ice frozen for hours.  The straw is a nice feature.  It's made of rubber & the top portion of it is made of a flexible silicone material.  So I don't have to tilt the tumbler to drink...",5
3/25/2023,Great size. Insulated and still fits in car drink holder. Very easy to clean. I loved the clear view lid so I can easily see the remaining water level. The straw is silicone which I prefer. I'm very happy with this. It's a great value compared to other brands that have comparable products.,5
3/9/2023,"The first major benefit of this oversized 40 oz tumbler is that it fits perfectly in my car cup holder. This is a huge design win in my opinion. There are many high volume tumblers that do no fit in the car cup holder. The handle is thick and molds great in my hand. To hold this tumbler, just feels comfortable and not awkward in any way. This is an amazing design. The straw stands up high above the rim of the tumbler. This is another great design. Other tumblers the straw will be maybe 1 inch, at the highest above the tumbler rim. This straw stands nearly 3 inches above the tumbler rim. There is no need for bending to drink from the tumbler. This Ozark Trail Tumbler has so many features that makes it top in its class - standing way out high...",5
3/3/2023,"I love this cup! It is a perfect size, especially when you're traveling. It fits in the cup holder so it won't wiggle around. I like how large it is so you don't have to refill it multiple times. It is very well insulated. I put a drink with ice in it in the afternoon and the next day, the ice was still unmelted! The straw is the perfect size. I like the flexible soft tip. I will be buying more of these in the future!",5
3/11/2023,"I received the Ozark Trail 40-ounce Stainless Steel Tumbler with Handle & Lid in White. Item #803-389-151. 
This is the kind of Big Gulp cup I can get behind! It's a really nice looking cup. Even without the lid, my drink felt colder longer than usual. Upon delivery, I did notice a dent on the bottom of the cup on the outer wall layer. I did not see any damage to the inner layer wall so fingers crossed, it'll holdup for a long time. 
The cup has a nice soft silicone? texture and the handle is solid plastic that is screwed on. While the lid has a rubber gasket to help create a seal, this lid is not spill proof. When using without the straw, you can rotate a plastic piece over the spout but it does not prevent leaks. Maybe to prevent bugs and...",5
3/4/2023,"I like to make my own iced tea and take with me in the car.  I sometimes just take ice water.  With this big stainless steel double walled tumbler, I can take either.  It has performed well in keeping whatever I put in it cold.  And the fact that it does not sweat is one thing that makes me love it.  Nothing is worse than packing up a drink and having it drip all over you and leave a ugly ring on the table.  This is my first tumbler with a handle.  I like it as the tumbler itself is big around and the coating makes it slick.  It would be easily dropped so the handle is a great idea.  This tumbler holds 40 ounces, 5 cups. I like having enough that I don't run out.  And if I'm taking water I have plenty to share if my dogs are along.  The top...",5
3/5/2023,"This tumbler is great! It's much bigger than I was thinking, but because the bottom is still small enough to fit in a cup holder, I'm totally happy with it! That's one of the huge bonuses with this cup...so many of mine don't fit in my cupholders! This is a great design where it has the handle and can still fit. I also like that it keeps my drinks cold for a long time and that the lid screws on (rather than just clicking on).",5
3/6/2023,"I got this tumbler through Walmart, and couldn't be happier! I have been looking for a tumbler with a straw, and was so happy to find this one! This 40oz tumbler is a perfect size for road trip and fits well on my car's cup holder, the most importantly, it keeps my water warm the whole time! Highly recommend!",5
4/19/2023,"Honestly, it’s worth $15 and works exactly the same as the infamous Stanley cup that’s way overpriced. The straw comes with a silicone extender piece I assume to get every drop of water or something lol. I do appreciate it though because I hate when the straws don’t reach the bottom of the tumbler/cup. Good buy.",5
3/3/2023,"I have been using Ozark Trail 40 oz Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel Tumbler and have been really pleased with it. The vacuum insulation keeps my drinks hot or cold for hours, making it perfect for long road trips or outdoor activities. The clear plastic lid with sliding closure is easy to drink from and the silicone gasket prevents leaks. However, due to its size, it's a bit too large to fit in standard cup holders and can be a challenge carrying around. Overall, I'm very satisfied with my usage of it and would recommend it to others looking for a durable and insulated tumbler.",5
3/16/2023,"I really love this cup. The design is very hot trending right now and it looks much better in person. The cup is lightweight, not too heavy even when I add water to full cup. It keeps the temperature of water pretty long. Like I normally fill the cup with ice water before heading to work and it's still cold til 2 or 3 in the afternoon. I can tell it's worth every penny.",5
3/27/2023,Love this cup! Only complaint is the screw top lid- if you prefer the straw to align on a certain side due to handle preference you may need to try screwing the lid on a few times to get it just right. It would be better if the lid was a push on with the gasket or just move the straw hole to the middle of the lid.,5
3/5/2023,"This tumbler has kept my drinks cold and with ice overnight in record highs in SouthernCalifornia! I was super happy to have found a cup that works like I need it to work. 

I'm clumsy and it has slipped out my hand a few times with no dents and and no spills with the lid.",5
3/11/2023,This thermal cup is awesome for my cold coffee. It keeps it my drinks ice cold for a long time and my hot drinks piping hot until I finish them. I especially love the lid as I did not know you could remove the straw and turn it to drink out of and close ot off when not drinking.,5
3/4/2023,There's really not much to say besides amazing. I love how big the cup is and how functional it is. I use it practically every day whether it's helping me keep up with my daily water intake or drinking my morning coffee. I highly recommend this product,5
3/21/2023,"This bottle is HUGE!  I fill it in the morning and carry it with me all day.  It's stainless steel so it keeps water cool for hours, but it's coated, so it's not too cold to carry.  It also has a handle for carrying.  I love the design of the straw--firm on the part that goes into the bottle and flexible on the top.  It's thicker in the middle so it fits securely in the bottle with no leaking at all.  The bottle is tapered at the bottom so it t sits in the car cup holder between the seats.  Very convenient.  Great bottle for making sure you get your water needs taken care of every day!",5
3/6/2023,I truly like this cup. It is just as big as the brand that everyone raves about. I actually like this brand better because it does not leak when i turn it upside down. The ice stays cold a formed tweleve hours later still. My coffee stay warm twelve hours later also.,5
3/5/2023,"This review is for the Ozark Trail 40 oz. tumbler.  It has a handle so it's easy to hold onto. This is way bigger than your average drink tumbler, it is huge and holds 40 oz. of your favorite beverage.  It comes with a straw as well to make it even easier to drink from.

I like the blue color that it's made from and the inside has a metal surface to keep your drink either very cold or very hot.  Did I mention it holds 40oz. of your favorite drink?  Consider that the average drink is about 12oz., this will hold three cans or bottles of your favorite drink.

I would recommend this tumbler to anyone who wants a tumbler that holds a lot of their favorite drink.",5
3/19/2023,"This stainless steel tumbler is fantastic. It is absolutely huge, as you can see compared to a red solo cup. It's great to take on the beach or to the park for the day. It really helps me drink a lot more water than I normally would have. It's super easy to clean although there are several crevices you have to scrub in the lid. I love the colors and I'm happy that it still fits into my cup holder because the bottom part is a regular cup size. I haven't tried any hot items, normally I only drink ice water.",5
4/28/2023,"Why spend $45   on a tumbler when you can spend $15 that does the exact same thing!!   I did spend $30 because I bought two of them. One for home and one for work, best decision ever.  With all of the water enhancers out there, I'm drinking 100 oz of water before noon everyday.  Meeting my water goals has never been easier.",5
3/5/2023,This stainless steel tumbler makes it easy to get my daily water.  I like that it is small on the bottom so that it fits into a car cup holder.  The lid screws on and off easily and the straw comes a part and cleans easily.  The lid rotates and you can drink without a straw.  It keeps my water cool and I like that I don't have to refill it as often.,5
3/14/2023,"The number one thing you have to know about this cup is that it's REALLY big.  I mean seriously, check out the picture of it in my hand. The lid screws on, which I like because it doesn't leak, but the straw is the really cool part - the part that goes in the cup is a regular plastic straw, but the part sticking out of the cup is the rubbery kind, which is very handy because it's tall, and you might not want to get it completely underneath your mouth so you can drink and you don't have to because the straw bends! Plus, look at the ombre!",5
3/4/2023,"I got this cup for my son but it became a family favorite. The size was larger than I thought which was great for filling it with ice and some flavored water and having it at my desk, in the car for school pickups, trips, etc!!! It's easy to clean, keeps your drinks the perfect temp and looks great!!",5
3/11/2023,"I love that the bottom of this cup is small enough so it fits into cupholders perfectly. I ran this through the dishwasher and it was fine. I like the plastic straw, but not a fan of the top rubber piece for washing. Its the perfect cup to carry around everywhere.",5
3/9/2023,Absolutely LOVE this tumbler! Beautiful matte finish and vibrant colors. The size is great and I am thrilled it is the lid and body are body dishwasher safe!! The included straw with silicone tip is perfect and it fits perfectly in my car cup holders. I am thrilled!,5
3/17/2023,"I love this travel tumbler. It keeps cold and hot for a long time, which makes it perfect for Coffee or your favorite iced drinks! It fits perfectly into the cup holder of my car, so no more struggling to find an adapter for it to fit. The lid is spill proof, which is always a plus as I'm clumsy at times. It's super easy to clean all of the pieces. I love the matte finish on it as well. This is an all around great tumbler to use around the house, on the go or traveling.",5
5/17/2023,"Love the sleek and comfort of this tumbler! Extremely comparable to the Stanley quencher except it is not as heavy and I actually like the straw design better (half silicone/half plastic). Keeps my beverages hot and cold and the price is unbeatable. Just wish it had more colors! I have the cutest one, the purple!",5
3/14/2023,"I can’t start my day without a hot cup of coffee. That’s why I’m so grateful to have this Ozark tumbler with a handle and straw! This 40-ounce stainless steel tumbler is double wall vacuum insulated, so it keeps my coffee hot and the exterior remains sweat-free and comfortable to the touch. Plus, I can take it with me in the car, since it fits in most cup holders.

My husband calls it the King of Tumblers because of its super-capacity size. He took it to work during a snow day and it kept his coffee nice and hot for several hours. Having 40 ounces of liquid means that I can fill up once and not have to worry about refilling until much later in the day. I love it for hot beverages like coffee, iced tea, and hot cider, but it also works great...",5
3/6/2023,"My husband and I both enjoy using this tumbler, and for different reasons. I like it mostly because it can hold and keep a large amount of water and ice cold for a long period of time. My husband enjoys the tumbler for his morning-turned-all-day coffee. He's a lefty, and loves how the handle is on the left side when the mouth spout option is open. I mostly use the straw option. There are two features of this tumbler that are of utmost importance to me: it doesn't sweat onto the surfaces it's set on, and it fits in my minivan's standard size cup holder. Overall, I think this is a good quality option for hot and/or cold drinks!",5
3/8/2023,"Wow, this tumbler is even better than it looked online. It holds an incredible amount of liquid- an incredible 40 ounces! The adjustable top can be closed, ope, or even open for a straw. The coating is a smooth, soft lavender with matching sturdy handle. The inside is is double-walled insulation that keeps hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold without sweating. This tumbler can be  washed in the top rack of your dishwasher if you ever need to sanitize it. 
I can't wait to embellish it with a couple of stickers.",5
3/7/2023,"Let me start this out by saying this is a huge cup! The colors are vibrant, and you can tell this is well made. 
The insulation kept my drink cold, filled about halfway with ice, for almost a full 24 hours.  
My only possible concern would be that there are screws holding the handle to the cup..which could possibly rust over time or become loose.

This is my new go to cup, I can stay hydrated or stay caffeinated. I also like that it comes with a straw that has a silicone end so I don’t hurt my teeth. I would definitely recommend this.",5
3/7/2023,"The Ozark Trail tumbler with handle is a 40 oz. stainless steel tumbler designed to keep your beverages hot or cold for an extended period. The tumbler provides maximum insulation for your drinks, ensuring that they stay at the desired temperature for longer.
The tumbler also comes with a clear lid to help prevent spills and keep your drink secure. The lid has a sliding closure that allows you to open and close it easily, and it fits snugly onto the tumbler to help maintain the temperature of your beverage.
The tumbler's handle provides a comfortable grip, making it easy to carry your drink with you wherever you go. This product is affordable, compared to many other brands, and high-quality. This tumbler works just as well as more expensive...",5
3/2/2023,"This tumbler has vacuum insulation to keep your drinks hot or cold for hours. The tumbler is large and can hold 40 ounces of liquid. It has a handle on it for easy usage. It has a sweat free design, which I really love. It has a lid on it that comes with a hole to drink out of, a hole for a straw and a piece that will cover the drinking hole to keep your drink safe. Cleaning the tumbler is easy and it is top rack dishwasher safe. I love the colors of the tumbler and how they fade into each other. The size of this tumbler is excellent for long trips or long days out when you need a lot of refreshment.",5
3/4/2023,"I have many tumbler cups in high and low priced brands and so far I've been very happy with this one. It's quite large and I needed a large cup because my kids are constantly drinking from mine. It does get heavy when full but worth it. The colors beautiful and I only hand wash it. I love the versatility of the cup from straw to sip and it even twists to accommodate each setting or to close. Overall, it's a great cup and has kept my drink cool for long periods. I would recommend this to others!",5
3/6/2023,"I love, love, love this cup!

 It's huge (actually holds the full 40oz), the straw is the perfect length (with a silicone end attached), the lid can be adjusted to be used without the straw (turn up to drink), and it keeps the temp of the beverages inside. 
The colors are definitely an added bonus. 
It fits into my vehicles' cupholders. 
I love the easy hold/carry handle.
It's all dishwasher safe as well. 

Only small con: I do wish that there was a way to enclose the straw or cap the straw, for sanitary reasons.",5
3/9/2023,"The Ozark Trail 40 oz Vacuum Insulated Stainless steel Tumbler in Blue in one of my new favorites because of its large size! I am notorious for not getting my daily water in and I love using this tumbler to help me reach my daily goal. I fill the tumbler in the morning and then again after lunch to make sure that I get at least 80 ounces in. The water stays cold each time I fill it. The tumbler is well made and durable with a large easy to hold handle. The twist on lid can be used with the included rubber tipped straw or you can twist the straw holder over for a wider opening. This tumbler is dishwasher safe, BPA free and comes with a lifetime warranty. I highly recommend!",5
3/7/2023,I work a very physically demanding job and it is important I stay hydrated. I unload semis and I had a cup I was using but I'd have to step away usually twice to fill my bottle back up with water during each unload. This one holds way more than the one I was using which makes me have to step away from unloading so much. Which helps me get dont quicker. It is a very sturdy and well made cup. I've dropped it and had my heart sink but thankfully it did not break. I love that it has a handle too. The straw I like has silicone on the tip of it making it more comfortable to drink out of. This has kept my ice water cold for well over 24 hours. I've left it at work or in the car and when I get back to it my water will still be cold!,5
3/20/2023,"The 40-ounce capacity of this reusable tumbler is fantastic for those who want to stay hydrated throughout the day without having to do  frequent refills.
It features a double wall insulation which is great for keeping the Beverage at the required temperature for a long time. It means that I can enjoy my drinks at the temperature I prefer without having to rush to finish them. It can contain both hot and cold drinks 
I really love the large handle which provides a firm grip and prevents the tumbler from slipping out of my hand. I also love that the straw can bend in multiple direction.
While this tumbler has many impressive features, it may not be the best choice for everyone due to its large size. It can make it challenging to fit into sma...",5
3/2/2023,"I live in Georgia, where it gets hot. I spend hours outside doing lawn work, gardening, and tending to my chickens. I try to maintain my water intakes by drinking at least 6 to 8 cups of water, even more when I am outdoors working up a big sweat. The first thing I love about the Ozark Trails 40 ounce stainless steel tumbler is the size. I am able to get more fluid in this without having to drop what I am doing constantly to refill my cup. This tumbler is insulated so it keeps your hot coffee, cocoa and tea hot as well as keeping ice all day. I literally filled up the cup with ice first thing in the morning and it lasts even out in the hot sun. It comes with a convenient straw for sipping. You can remove the straw as well and it has an openi...",5
3/22/2023,Bigger than expected! I like it cause you can honestly get a lot in the cup lol but I don't like the straw it seems to catch a lot of lint so I threw that away but it works just fine without it. The lid is a twist one so it's tight and doesn't come loose,5
4/26/2023,"LOVE this tumbler! Fits in my car cup holder great. Keeps ice all day. Super easy to wash. Handle is sturdy, the entire cup is amazing. People who spend $60  on tumblers are dumb, Ozark Trail is an amazing brand and are better than 99.9% of ‘high end'.",5
3/3/2023,"I love this new Ozark Trail 40oz stainless steel tumbler! Ozark Trail must have listened to people who use these types of tumblers of their desires for a tumbler like this.  I quit using my similar tumblers for several reasons, but one is not having an attached handle. This new Ozark Trail tumbler has a nice big handle built right in which makes grabbing the tumbler so much easier. My other tumblers had a separate handle that slipped on but constantly slipped off. The second reason I quit using the others is because of the push on lid. I was getting to the point that it was a struggle to get the lid off. With the screw on lid of this new design, taking the lid off and on is easier than ever. The flexible end of the straw is such a great ide...",5
2/4/2024,This is a great alternative to the Stanley version. Such a cute vibrant pink color.,5
1/28/2024,"Love the color options and price, the ice stays for hours! As good as a Stanley!!",5

10/24/2023,I filled this up with ice at 6 am and put water in it multiple times throughout the day. It is still half full of ice at 8 pm. It works great!,5
3/4/2023,Great cup that will keep your drink cold and protected. It looks great and seems to be really nice quality. I would definitely use this from every day to day to camping. Bigger size is handy and color is very sharp looking as well.,5

This can be for a man or women.it is very easy to keep in the car while traveling. Kerps my drink hot or cold. This is my favorite  tumbler.",5
4/23/2023,"Pretty, Pretty, Pretty!! GREAT dupe for stanley cups. $15 over a $45 cup any day of the week! Does everything it needs to do.. the straw does allow everything to stay cold all day, so I suggest to keep air out, use the switch spot.",5

I am very happy to have this.,5
2/23/2023,I really like this insulated coffee mug! It keeps my coffee hot all day long and it is easy to clean . I think one of the best features of the mug Is the placement of the handle. The handle is high up on the my which makes it really easy to hold and sonce most of the weight is below the handle it is easy to hold.,5

2/23/2023,I wanted a mug that would do hot or cold liquids for when I am out and about and this Mug filled all of my expectations. I wanted something with a soft color and white is very easy to clean and I really like the cool color. It comes with an attached straw that can be disassembled the top part of this straw is a flexible silicone the bottom part is a hard plastic. When you put the cap onto this mug I am right handed what you would do if you would put where the straw would be in the middle of the cup and then twist and it will always go to that side for a right handed person go to the other side where the handle is and that's for a left handed person. If you are drinking hot fluids you would take the straw out do a flip on the top black piece...,5
2/24/2023,"Wow! This tumbler by Ozark Trail is absolutely the best. It looks great, has a comfortable handle, has a narrower bottom so it fits perfectly in cup holder in cars, strollers, etc. It's high quality insulation keeps your beverage nice and warm, or chill - whichever you like.

It fits perfectly in my cup holder which is a huge plus for a 40oz cup.  The finish is so smooth, I love it.  The lid is see through enough to be able to see how much liquid you have left in the cup.  It is not 100% spill proof.  I filled it full and tipped it over and a little water came out but it wasn’t pouring out.  The straw has a silicone tip which I wasn’t sure about but it is super comfortable and large enough to let a lot of water to get through.  Keeps my water nice and cold.  Very happy with this cup!",5

2/28/2023,"I LOVE this cup. This is one of my favorite cups, this one is next level! It is excellent at keeping things cold even with no ice. It is GIANT though. The size of my steering wheel!  So while it hold a good amount of liquid it doesn't fit in my dishwasher. I have the small rack at the top so if you don't have that it might fit in yours. Even though it's large it still fits in my cars cup holder perfectly. It's a little big at dinner time to keep on the table it blocks my family's faces haha it's a matte smooth texture. The handle is screwed on which is slightly different texture than the cup but it works good because it's a big more grippy than the smooth cup.",5
2/27/2023,"Wow!  This is a big, beautiful tumbler from Ozark Trail.  I specifically wanted this one because it holds 40 ounces of beverage.  Trying to drink more water throughout the day and this cup is helping me meet that goal.  Here's how:  it fits in a standard cup holder!   That means I can take it with me wherever I go.  (This was a problem with other brands…a big 40 ounce container is not usually built for a cup holder). It is a beast, but it has a nice, solid handle that makes carrying it around easy. It comes with a lid that has three positions.  One position allows for the included straw to have a secure fit, a second position opens up a slightly larger opening for drinking directly, and a third position closes off the lid completely.  The l...",5

It has a smoke colored transparent screw on lid to help prevent spills. It comes with an over 12 inch long straw. It's rust proof. It offers a sweat-free design to keep the outside of the container dry on hot days. It's BPA free. It's top-rack dishwasher safe. It has a nice big comfortable handle. It fits nicely in most car cup holders. 

I fill it just once and I'm good for the long haul. I love it!",5
3/2/2023,Awesome dupe for a brand name tumbler. The cup fits I to my car cup holders and keeps my water nice and chilled. It can be used with a straw or without. Kinda wish the straw was metal too. Love the soft silicone end for sipping out of as it is flexible and can be sipped from any direction. The lid screws on well and flush with the main body.,5
3/1/2023,"This Ozark Trail tumbler is now my favorite drink container. Vacuum insulated for keeping drinks hot or cold for extended periods of time. I don't know for how long because my drinks are usually gone within an hour or less. It comes with its own straw set up; a hard plastic straw connected to a soft flexible straw/tube that seals in the hole of the lid. Great lid too. It screws on, so it won't fall off after a long time of usage, the lid has a movable piece that can be turned to seal the top (not completely leak proof) limiting any amount of spillage if the tumble is knocked over or turned so you can use it without the straw set up. It also has a handle that makes it very easy to hang onto when using. Even with the 40-ounce capacity, the tu...",5

The large opening allows for easy filling with ice cubes and water. The twist off plastic cap closes securely and is cleverly designed with an opening for the straw, a separate sip opening and you can also twist the top of the cap to close the lid in order to keep your drink fresh and clean. This stainless steel tumbler is awesome to stay hydrated and take anywhere with me, it makes it easy to always have water by my side throughout the day and bedside at night....",5
2/28/2023,I absolutely love this insulated tumbler.  I was looking for one that would keep my water and lemon cold all night on my bedside table as I like to sip through the night and first thing in the morning.  This one certainly fits the bill.  I fill it up around 8PM with ice and water and at 7AM it is still ice cold.  It has a large handle for easy gripping when it is full.  It has a 40 oz capacity which when filled twice per day satisfies my daily water goal.  It even fits in the cup holder in my car.  I love the flexible straw that's easy to clean.  Don't hesitate to get a few of these.,5
3/1/2023,"I'm a drinker. I have to have fluid in front of me all the time and a big meal goes down with a lot of drinking. This thing is enormous and gets refilled way less per day and the cup-holder size base means it lasts between pit-stops on the road too. The stainless steel vacuum sides mean the ice stays ice the whole time too. The straw admittedly took a little getting used to as the top few inches are a soft silicone while the remainder is a standard stiff straw....but as soon as I wrapped my brain around it, I wish they were all this way.",5
2/26/2023,Ok so if you are obsessed with cups as much as me then you need this cup. The color is so pretty and it keeps my water cold all day at work on my 12 hour shifts. Holds a whole 5 cups also. The bottom is smaller so it fits in your cup holder! Get this cup yal.,5
3/1/2023,"Love, love, love this tumbler!!  Love that it holds 40oz.  Love that the top screws on!  Love the entended straw with the flexible rubber end making a bendy straw.  Gorgeous blue color and it maintains cold temps beautifully!  I haven't tried hot liquids yet but I'm sure it will be stellar.  I love that it has a handle AND you can see through the lid for the level of beverage.  The bottom is skinnier so it fits my beverage holder in the suvs and truck.  Best tumbler EVER!!",5
2/26/2023,Wow. I have had ice in this  tumbler for over 48 hours. I haven't tried hot beverage yet. I'm sure it won't disappoint. It holds 40 ounces and has a Lifetime warranty. Love the color too. Has a handle for easy gripping. It has not leaked at all. Comes with a straw also. I recommend the Ozark Trail tumbler. Dishwasher safe.,5
3/1/2023,"This cup is the perfect cup. It holds lots of liquid, it has a handle to hold it! The straw is the perfect size, i hate a thin straw. The colors are vibrant. It fits in my cars cupholders and my 4 seater kids wagon. I love this cup! It keeps my drink cold as well.",5
2/26/2023,The perfect insulated tumbler!! It's so pretty and sleek! I love the handle and the straw that comes with it. It keeps ice frozen for days and drinks colder than ever! It's easy to clean. This is a must for summer time or ever day use! Highly recommend!!,5
2/28/2023,"I love this cup!  It is a stainless steel 40-oz cup that keeps water and ice cold for a long time.  The bottom of the cup is slender and fits into my car’s cup holder; the handle is large and well attached to the cup.  The lid screws on (instead of popping on/off), the straw has a silicone piece of the end which makes it comfortable to use and allows the straw to reach to the very bottom; the top of the cup lid is very deep and has a couple of ways to drink from it (straw insert/direct drink) and can be sealed shut.  The outside of the cup is not fingerprint proof.  
Overall, I think it is a fantastic cup which I love to carry around and use everyday.  Not only do I highly recommend, but I will buy more of these for my family.",5
2/28/2023,"Love this tumbler! Love the size. 

The large 40 oz capacity helps me drink more water and saved me money from always grabbing bottles of water. Which has an additional positive component because it means I’m helping the environment in the process by using less plastic!

The cup is cut at the bottom to fit in a car cup holder.  If you are to use this tumbler in the car a nice feature is the flexible straw. This is a convenient feature that makes it easy to get sips in while holding the cup at a lower incline. In other words, with a standard straw you have to hold the cup up or risk bending/breaking the straw or restricting the flow of liquid due to the straws airflow being restricted. But with the bendable flexi straws the cup can be held l...",5
2/27/2023,Surprisingly I've been debating this cup for awhile but kept putting it off. I finally got this cup in my favorite color and I love it. This is my go to when I need to grab something to drink to take to work. I put my ice in followed by whatever I am drinking that morning. My drink stays pretty cold until I'm ready to fill up again. You will not regret this purchase!,5
2/26/2023,I am in love with this cup!!! The handle is an absolute life saver!! I have been trying to drink 100 ounces a days and this 40 ounce tumbler helps tremendously! I like how the cups is shaped and will fit in any cup holder. The insulation is nice too. This cup still had ice in it the next day.,5
3/1/2023,"This is my new favorite tumbler! I have been making it a point to drink more water everyday and I am so glad I got this! For starters its super cute with its pretty colors. I love that it can hold 40oz of liquid and even though I use it for water I have the option to drink hot beverages in it too. 
I really like the handle making it easy to carry around with me around the house or on the go. The lid is screw on which I like as well, gives me extra assurance that the liquids won't drip out while I'm drinking from it. You can either drink from the top of the lid or use the included straw which I have to say is awesome too! Also easy to clean!",5
2/23/2023,"I am in LOVE with this cup!! The size is great, it holds 40oz of water. It keeps my water cold for several hours (and hot drinks hot for several hours). The handle is comfortable to use and the straw is super great because it has a rubber top half that fits very snug into the straw hole to help create a vacuum seal. Also it fits perfectly in my cup holder at the gym so I'm definitely sold on the cup!",5
2/26/2023,"First and foremost, this is the biggest tumbler I have ever owned and I love it! I drink water all day everyday and try to meet water goals everyday- this tumbler is perfect for that! At 40 ounces, it towers over the rest of my water cups. It is extremely well made, tough and durable, including the straw and the top as well. My favorite things about this tumbler is that it actually fits in my drink holder in my car. I like that it has a handle. I also like that the lid screws on to keep it secure instead of just popping in. I also like that it gives me the option of using the straw, sipping or being able to close it completely. I can put ice in it at night and the next morning there will still be ice in it! I also like that the straw is sup...",5
2/26/2023,"40 oz insulated tumbler with a super convenient handle. You can use it with or without the removable, washable straw. It is sturdy, made well, lid is screw on/off for ease. Opening can be closed off. Tumbler is top rack dishwasher safe. Ice lasts literally for hours, I love that it doesn't sweat, my drinks stay cold and it fits in my car cup holder! I drink more water now, mainly because it's so easy to take with you wherever you go. I love it.",5
2/27/2023,"The Ozark Trail 40 oz insulated tumbler is everything anyone could ask for in a tumbler. The outer colored powder coating is nice, the plastic handle is attached and comfortable to grip and the lid is twist on. The cup is designed to fit in your cup holder even though it holds a whopping 40 oz. I have used this cup all day for 4 days in a row and I cannot find anything I do not like about it.  Let's talk about this lid; the lid has a rotating center piece to adjust from straw to regular and then to close. It twists on and stays sealed all day. The included straw is hard plastic and does not come above the lip of the cup but there is a rubber attachment that is removable and washable to drink from. It can be bent while drinking which is nice...",5
2/26/2023,"40OZ VACUUM INSULATED STAINLESS STEEL TUMBLER-GRADIENT

This cup is large; I've been taking 2 cups to work to have enough liquid to go all day. Now I only need this big one. It's really a pretty color.
What I like is the size, it fits in my cup holder, it has a screw on lid with a long straw, and is dishwasher friendly.
My drinks stay cold and this cup doesn't sweat all over the car. I'll be able to use this daily for years.",5
3/1/2023,I love the look of this tumbler. First off the colors are absolutely beautiful. Secondly it is powder coated I believe and it is so so so smooth. It kepts my drink with ice for nearly 2 days. Which is perfect in my opinion. I use pebble ice and it kept it mostly frozen. I still has some left T the end of 2 days. I drink normally water with ice and or a mix in.,5
2/28/2023,I wasn’t sure how I’d feel about such a large travel mug but I LOVE IT. It keeps beverages cold for a very long time and definitely makes me drink more. I love that the lid is a screw on instead of a rubber gasket. I did knock it out of my cup holder in the car and there was very little spillage despite it being full.,5
3/1/2023,This tumbler definitely surpasses any tumbler I've seen. The size is very impressive as is the ability for it to keep things hot or cold for long periods of time. It's very easy to clean and is quite durable. I accidentally dropped it already and it did not get damaged. It still looks great! The amount of liquid it can hold is It's most impressive attribute. Very highly recommended.,5
4/15/2023,Worth it! Keeps water cold.,5
4/12/2023,LOVE this cup!! such a pretty color.  does great keeping drinks cold.,5
6/21/2023,Just like a combo YETI/Stanley but more affordable and awesome!,5
3/30/2023,I love that the top twists on! And the jelly straw!,5
5/10/2023,Great quality. Stays cold and with ice all day and next day,5
3/10/2023,Absolutely love it! It’s the Stanley Duped lol I loved it so much a bought 2 defined must buy!,5
3/12/2023,If you can get your hands on this just buy it!!!,5
2/23/2023,"I cannot rave enough about this cup. It holds an great amount of 40 oz and keeps my drinks cold. I love the straw that it came with also. The best added bonus is the size of the bottom, which fits perfectly in my cup holder in my car.",5
2/24/2023,I love this cup probably going to be one of my new favorites. The only thing I would change is the straw being a straight plastic straw without a soft silicone tip but that would just be my preference.,5
2/28/2023,"If you are a water drinker and hate filling your cup all the time, then get this cup! This cup is massive in size, but isn't bulky. It's a great cup for everyday use for anyone who drinks a lot through the day!",5
2/14/2024,I love these I have 3!! 40oz makes it easy to get my gallon of water in while at work. !! They do the job! Love the straw! Added a sticker to this one !!,5
2/27/2023,"Forty ounce stainless steel tumbler with handle, lid and straw. Double wall vacuum insulation keeps drinks hot or cold. Sweat free design. BPA free. Top rack dishwasher safe. Lifetime warranty. Love the lilac color.",5
2/28/2023,Really awesome insulated cup. It holds ice for hours which has been great on long drives to the coast. It also fits really well in our cup holders. I also really like the flexible straw top it comes with.,5
2/28/2023,While working i like a cup that can accomedate water for at least 4 hours.  This cup can absolutly do that.  Its steel so it will stay Cold or Hot as needed for hours.  When ice is added it is even better for cold drinks.,5
2/28/2023,"This insulated thermos cup holds a lot of liquid, it keeps it cold for a long time and it fits perfectly in all cup holders. It is a little on the heavy side but it’s definitely a really nice cup and I want to get more of these!",5
3/1/2023,I love my new tumbler!!!! The handle is a game changer and the lid can be used with a straw or you can rotate the black part to just drink straight from the tumble. It's awesome I love the lilac color as well it's so soft.,5
3/1/2023,Excellent tumbler! Big in size but is not heavy. The color is beautiful and I received many compliments. The handle is a great design. Holds forty ounces but had cup holders size bottom for taking in vehicle. Love it!,5
3/2/2023,"Very nice and very cute color very comparable to the trendy tumblr that are popular right now and for only $15 and not $40 does the same thing, without the heavy price and get compliments in the color!!! Would definitely get more if I need it lol",5
12/20/2023,"It's absolutely gorgeous, I have the sunset looking one with the orange,, pink, and blue colors. It's so pretty and has such a nice, matte finish to it. It has a soft straw, its not hard plastic. The cup itself keeps things cold for forever, it will hold ice with *several* refills of water for OVER 24 hours! It's honestly my new favorite cup. I have several by Ozark and they're all made great, some I've had for close to 8 years and they're still in great shape, no paint peeling, still keep thinga hot for long periods of time and cold for even longer.",5
12/20/2023,I love this cup!!! I wanted a cheaper version of the Stanley and this works so well! And it's cheap!☺️ My brother has had one long before me and the only problem he is having is chipping at the bottom on the outside of the cup but he's really rough with his. I ordered a silicone sleeve just to be safe so mine will last longer. Other than that it helps me drink so much more!,5
2/7/2024,"I really like this cup. I found a few Stanley knock offs on this one is my favorite. One thing I really like is the straw. The top half is silicone which I prefer over plastic or stainless steel. It's a tight fit for the straw, but it helps to cut down on leakage, it still leaks if it's spilled but not as bad as some others. keeps my drink cold for hours and my cup will still have ice in it the next day.",5
1/31/2024,This cup keeps ice for at least 24 hours! I also love that the top part of the straw is softer material so it isn't a hard plastic straw. I only wish that it was spill proof when I remove the straw and slide the cover into place but this cup is a steal!,5
2/7/2024,"this tumbler washes great. i needed one that was dishwasher safe. ive washed it twice now %26 washes fine.
Keeps my beverages nice %26 cold. I left my pepsi in the tumbler for 5 hours %26 when i came back %26 took a drink it was still cold! i was surprised. the only ""dislike"" was that it came dirty. there was a mark on the outside that was hard to get off. otherwise i was happy with the purchase. i recommended buying.",5
1/27/2024,"The lid is somewhat a pain to screw on at times, but overall, this cup is great. It's half the price maybe more, than these boujee other brands that ppl are buying. It holds ice over 24 hours, it is durable, and comes in cute colors! It's a 10/10 from me!",5
2/11/2024,While everyone are willing to spend $$$ on a Stanley those like me aren't able too with the way our bank accounts is set up or we just don't have it like that and need to save. Understandable. I needed something reliable and sturdy since starting a new job so I can keep hydrated with water and it stay cold. Ozark! What about when my I don't have time to drink coffee in the morning and enjoy it before my shift starts because my morning is already crazy enough as a single mom and having to get my kids ready for school and sent to the babysitter just to catch the bus  on time and I don't like cold coffee? Ozark! This has been a best investment I've made and I just love the color choices. I hope a yellow can be made soon.,5
2/1/2024,This is perfect if you need an extra jumbo amount of coffee or if you just want to get your daily water intake all in one cup. It is nice that the straw is removable for hot items and usable for cold drinks. I like how dark it is and no scuffs show on it.,5
6/20/2023,Love,5
1/26/2024,i got this before the whole Stanley cup craze and honestly I've seen the Stanley this is way better. There are more colors it's way cheaper it washes easily. I left a soda with ice on my office overnight and when i woke up there was still the same amount of ice in it! it fits good in cup holders too.,5
2/9/2024,"I have tried the Stanley 40 oz tumbler and I was not impressed. I love ice cold water and when 90% of my ice was gone in the Stanley, I went back to my Ozark Trail tumbler and it has kicked Stanley's butt in my opinion! I fill my glass with a lot of ice at 6:30 am and then add water - room temp or cold - and I still have a full cup of ice 18 hours later. At about 30 hours, I add more ice but the liquid never warms up!! That is a true success story. 

I have one in purple and wanted another one...one for home and one for when I go to class. LOVE the mint green color and it meets all my expectations and for less than 1/3 the cost of a Stanley. I am very, very, VERY content with my OT cup!!",5
2/18/2024,"Second cup I've bought, only because I loved it so much I wanted another one to swap out with throughout the week! It fits in all my cup holders, the couch and in my car. The handle and the amount it holds is what makes this the perfect cup for a busy mom/nurse/wife/woman on the go like me! I have one in pink and my newest is navy. 10/10 for sure.",5
1/31/2024,My husband always has a jug of ice water nearby. He has arthritis in his hands from years of mechanical work and the farm. It was hard to hold those big round 7-11 jugs. So for Christmas I bought him this Ozark Trail mug with handle. He loves it! And honestly it holds ice as good as my Stanley mug for half the price,5
2/13/2024,"These cups are amazing. Our family has been using them for many years and really happy to see the bigger version that fits in your cars cup holder.  Obviously has the similar look to the popular Stanley cups which are much more expensive and honestly don't work as good.  Keeps your drinks cold and you can even put hot drinks and it will keep them hot.  Flexible straw, great colors. We gave them to our adult children as gifts and they were thrilled.",5
2/15/2024,"I refuse to spend a fortune on a cup, and I really like Ozark Trail stuff so I decided to give their 40 oz tumbler a whirl. It did not disappoint. I haven't put anything hot in it yet, but eight large ish ice cubes from my freezer trays last around 24 hours. My drink was already chilled in the fridge when I added it to my tumbler, and it was in my 66 degree house, so no extreme temperatures to battle. 
To me, that's more than good enough and I'm happy with my fancy cup.",5
2/7/2024,"I'm on the road all day for my job, so I need a lot to drink without having to carry extra or stop and get something throughout the day. This cup fits perfectly in my car cup holder, holds enough to last me all day, and its keeps it cold. The best features are the handle, the straw, how pretty they are ( and the colors hold up, i use mine everyday and they look brand new), and they hold the same ice for over 36 hours! Ive bought 4 of these in different colors and just absolutely love them, especially for the amazing price!!",5
2/10/2024,These cups are absolutely amazing! I tested one of mine with hot water and iced water. They definitely keep your drink cold /or hot! I now have multiple and will definitely be buying even more!  And even better they're less than half the price of a Stanley and to me work better!,5
2/13/2024,"It's a little tall, but it holds a lot. I love that it fits into the drink carrier in my car, and I love the handle. The straw doesn't come out of the lid, so you don't lose it, but it also makes it a little awkward to clean and to replace the lid when there's ice in the cup. The lid screws on, which at times isn't easy to replace, but it realky seals the cup do it doesn't leak or spill. It is dishwasher safe and is very stable and sturdy",5
1/23/2024,"I don't have a Stanley Cup to compare it to, but it is doing its job. Great cup and excellent quality. The only problem is the color choices. I wanted a red, but they sold out very quickly.",5
3/19/2023,"I saw all the hype about the Stanley 40 oz tumbler and looked them up and wow, pricey! Of course after my search other tumblers starting showing up. This Ozark Trail 40 oz with handle showed up in my feed and the reviews were great so I headed to Wal Mart to get one. I got the gradient color in peach pink and blue. This is an amazing cup! It cost four times less than the Stanley and works so well! I brought it home and filled it half with ice and then filled it up with water. 24 hours later most of the ice was still there! Summer will be the true test outside but I feel this will stand up well. The 40 oz has a nice secure lid with a totally cool silicone topped straw and a moveable piece on top to use with the straw or use as a sipping cup....",5
1/7/2024,"I love this cup. I needed something that held more than just 24oz, but nothing ever fit in my cup holding in my car. I only like ozark trail, so when I saw this I immediately bought it. It does leak a little through the actual straw if the cup gets turned over. It's pretty heavy as well so if you have bad hands, I'd look for something else.",5
1/13/2024,"I absolutely love this cup. It has a soft straw to drink out of, but the straw is nice and sturdy on the inside. It keeps my drinks nice and cold all day. I usually top the ice off and night, and it will keep my drink nice and cold all night. It has a sturdy handle that's screwed in, so I don't have to worry about it falling off. I absolutely love this cup. My toddler loves this cup. Will definitely be buying another one.",5
1/21/2024,"I took a trip last year, and lost one of my beloved RTIC steel tumblers with the add-on handle. I love the 40 Oz capacity, especially for my bedside table overnight.

The RTIC tumblers are less expensive at $17.99, but shipping, straws, and the handle kit cost a significant amount of money.

Enter the Ozark Trail tumbler, essentially the same as their Stanley counterparts. Maybe even made in the same factory, but I cannot  confirm this right, but they look the same.

The cup keeps my water icy cold, the lid screws on snugly, it fits my van's cupholders, and, I caught mine on sale for $13 each, delivered, because I'm a W  member. Value city, baby!

Those folks thrashing to get those ""special edition"" tumblers at ridiculous prices make me gig...",5
1/11/2024,I love this cup. I need ice in my water and we don't have an ice maker at work. I'll fill this at home before I leave and it will keep the ice from my commute and refills all day through the ride home. And it keeps my ice coffee ice cold or my hot coffee hot until I am done drinking. What really sold me was the handle. I have to 30 oz without the handle and this one is much easier to carry with my hands full.,5
1/9/2024,I read several reviews prior to purchasing.  Some make you want to reconsider but I bought it. It seems to really matter to a few people how long does it keep Ice. Well personally I don't want two day old Ice. But it was still solid after a day and a half when I threw it out. My husband has several Ozark Trail tumblers that was my proof that it was a good buy. If $50 is as ridiculous to you as it was me Buy This Tumbler!,5
1/8/2024,We are 40 oz stainless cup connoisseurs in our house. Our favorite is the HydraFlow and  milk decided to try this one because it was on clearance. it's a nice stainless cup but I don't care that the straw is completely plastic/silicone whereas the HydraFlow cups have a stainless straw with a separate silicone nib. The color is vivid but feels course on the outside and I'm afraid it will eventually get scratched and nicked. I should have used the $20 to buy another HydraFlow,5
1/19/2024,"I regularly get compliments on my “Stanley” and people are shocked to find out it's not real. As a mom of all boys, I take the opportunity get all pink things just got me whenever I can. I've never had a real Stanley, but this one keeps my drinks cold and I'm very happy.",5
1/17/2024,"Im pregnant and need to stay hydrated. Normally, I prefer room temp water but iced drinks and ice itself just hits different when you're pregnant. This cup is only a fraction of the price of the name brand trending cups, and does the same thing. I fill my cup with ice in the morning and lasts till the middle of the next day.",5
1/7/2024,I am not the biggest fan of Walmart but their Ozark trail stuff always seems to be great quality for the price. I have other knock off S cups like this but this one is by far the best. I bought it cause I like the color but it will hold ice for literal days.,5
1/23/2024,I absolutely adore my Ozark tumbler. I was able to get the beautiful pink color I love without having to wait in line and fight off others for an overpriced brand that's gone viral. This tumbler meets the aesthetic as well as keeps my drinks cold ALL DAY. I had mine delivered. WIN/WIN/WIN!!!,5
1/16/2024,"This tumbler is great. I love the color and it was only $13!  I like room temperature water, so I don't know how long it holds ice. I like the flexible silicon straw. I do wish I could find a straw topper that would fit the straw, otherwise, I am pleased with my purchase   Also fits just fine in my car.",5
1/14/2024,"Bought this cup by accident, but still happy I did. Had it in my cart and ordered grocery pickup in a hurry before I lost my pickup time. Cup will keep ice in it for over 24hrs! I like how the top of the straw is rubber so it is flexible if you happen to smack it by accident it won't topple the whole cup over. Love the color of it too.",5
1/14/2024,"I purchased this for my mom while she recovers from surgery.  The cup is big (tall) but not too heavy when full.  It keeps water cold although the ice melts within a few hours.  It's been great to keep her hydrated, and she loves the purple color.  Overall a great cup for the price.",5
1/19/2024,This is the best tumbler ive yet to own. It keeps your favorite beverages cold and fresh. i bought the mint green one. Beautiful color. Might buy another color. i like it so much. i highly recommend this tumbler if you want to keep your drink 🥶 COLD.,5
1/20/2024,"Absolutely love this product! I've owned it for about two weeks and it works great! I bring it to work with me and it stays cold the entire 10 hour shift! Also love the big handle to put my hand through, it makes it much easier to hold! I haven't tried any hot stuff in it yet but I'm excited to try!",5
1/6/2024,"I bought the Lilac color for a white elephant gift. To say it was envied is an understatement. I ended up buying 4 more. at $15 each (a little less), why would I go spend $30 or more on a stainless steel branded cup that does the exact same thing. Ozark Trail did a fine job making this cup. I enjoy using it and the colors are great too. Thanks for making it more reasonably priced.",5
1/19/2024,This tumbler is great. It holds up. The only issue that I have is the straw that came with it.  It's short and they just added silicone top piece to the straw.  I will have to buy straws that will fit the length of this tumbler but other than that it's great. Love the color as well!,5
1/4/2024,I absolutely love this Tumblr it keeps my drinks ice cold and when I have ice in one of my drinks it takes really really long for the ice to melt at all the only complaint I have about it is that it is pretty large which makes it hard to accommodate in like cup holders in a car or anything like that,5
1/21/2024,"this tumbler is the same size as a Stanley and keeps ice for hours. I am a teacher and dont always get to drink my water before the ice melts, this is my solution. I do need to have my drink cold when I refill it so that it doesnt melt the ice (again as a teacher I dont have ready access to more ice) but that is with any cup/tumbler.",5
1/8/2024,"It did exactly what I wanted it to do. It now fits in the cupholder in the car. I knew that was going to be true when I saw it. However, it now allows it space to have another cup in the holder right next to it.

Took me a day to get used to the different shape. I also had to create a different space in the fridge. Any negative, and I can't think of one, is out wage by allowing 2 cups in the car's cup holder. .

I have not previously used a screw top lid. For the first few days I removed the straw to take the lid off or on. I was tickled pink when I discovered that I could get the straw where I wanted by starting it on the opposite side of where I wanted to drink . I felt that was really cool!",5
12/30/2023,Walmart sends request to the company for a pick up return. I have scheduled 4 pick up and no one show up. What a waste of time. Inaccurate description of products. Can't get my money back from Walmart. They are telling me I have to keep scheduling a pick up for them to return my money.,1
9/17/2020,"They came in ok, but after several months it started to bunch up.  Grandson put a cup on bed and OJ went everywhere.  It bunched up where in the center the springs was visible through the top cover.  Now its has bunched up in two spots and I will include pictures.  I contacted Zinus the company and after giving me the run around for over two weeks they made an executive decision to not send another mattress or a refund.  There people act like they have heard it all before, so don't buy this mattress.  Its terrible and now I have to buy a new mattress and it won't be zinus.  They don't know what customer service is about.  Dont't Buy.",1

9/19/2023,Came with big yellow stain very unsatisfied! I contacted the seller and haven't heard anything. Why would a company sell people dirty stained up mattresses not okay smh,1
9/17/2023,When opening I seen a yellow stain on the plastic thought it was only the plastic that was dirty. As I proceeded to open the plastic to see if it was the bed the yellow stain was on the bed.,1
3/30/2021,the springs are messed up around the edges and is nothing but flat. you go to get up and just roll off of the side. you try to sleep anywhere other than directly in the middle and this bed will not work.,1
3/30/2021,springs on the edges just collapse and go flat. if you go to get up then you just roll off the bed. if you sleep with a partner or anywhere other than in the middle you will roll off the ends.,1
10/29/2020,my son got this bed and has not had it for a year and the springs are popping up out of it. Poking him in the back when he sleeps i would not recommend this bed.,1

8/21/2013,"I purchased this mattress in king size 1.5 years ago. Its warped. Ive attached a picture. If you weight 230 or more lbs you will warp this mattress. My fiance and I weight about 230 each, which in my opinion isnt incredibly overweight or anything, not enough to warp a mattress!! I mean, it was cheap, so I dont know what I expected.....but now its warped and you can tell its warped even with blankets on it. There is a hump in the middle.",1
1/13/2024,Ordered and received a different mattress(poor quality compared to zinus). Assured right mattress would come if ordered again. Received another brand poor quality mattress for the 2nd time. Estes delivery company no shows every time I schedule a return(5 now)and Walmart is yet to do anything about it. Order if you want a wrong/poor quality mattress and want to deal with this insane return process.,1
1/11/2024,This mattress is so soft and springy It is not good for anyone that has back issues. The description makes it sound like it is a comfortable bed it is not when you sit on it it goes flat almost flat it is horrible. consider buying another mattress don't waste your money. I now have to find another mattress and spend more money what am I going to do with this mattress?,1
6/16/2022,Was delivered with a burn mark and I had to return and buy another from the store that was $50 more due to the time frame I needed the mattress for.,1
11/14/2023,"I bought this horrible mattress, I asked for it to be returned two months ago and they still haven't given me my money back. Don't buy this mattress, especially if it's from them. I have been sleeping on the floor for more than two months due to your incompetence.",1
11/14/2023,"Everytime I ordered a big ticket idem Walmart uses FedEx shipping which happens to be a nightmare when receiving my packages.. they give you a date for quick prompt delivery and then play games with you by using text communication asking you dozens of questions about your order when they already know precisely that your package has never left their location or hasn't been loaded on a delivery truck to be delivered but they send you text messages the evening prior saying that it will be delivered tomorrow between 7am and 3pm. it's very annoying.. smh
I wish Walmart wouldn't use them as much because They totally suck..",1
11/10/2023,"I was excited for this to arrive. I ordered with enough time for my move but on the day it was supposed to arrive, I didn't receive anything. Next day, I was told it was delivered. Then told it got cancelled. Then finally told it was lost in transit. I think I could handle of this if it was communicated to me instead of me having to reach out to customer service for answers. Now I have to start the process all over again and sleep on the sofa until I find something.",1
10/27/2023,"doesnt hold weight. nothing as described. flimsy, sinks in and can particularly fold in half after inflation. dont buy this product. i am still waiting for my refund and they picked up the mattress almost two weeks ago. and they didnt even want to pick it up.",1

1/23/2024,Came in good time easy to open and take out. The mattress itself is not comfortable for me at all. I figured I'd give it time maybe it's just me but it's been months and it's extremely uncomfortable haven't had a good night sleep at all.,1
4/18/2014,"I bought this mattress after carefully looking at all the Reviews, and it seemed that it would be reasonably firm. But this bed is way too soft for my comfort. I am 180 lbs, and seem to sink into the mattress. Every morning, I wake up with a back ache (which was not there with my previous mattress), and after trying it for two weeks patiently, not much has changed. Wonder if I can return it at this stage...",1
12/18/2013,"The item was delivered on time and the packaging was in good condition however mattress was not as depicted in the original offer and after the 48 hour expansion period it remained misshapen.
The item is to be returned and I have requested a replacement which is as described in the original offer.",1
12/1/2020,"You get what you paid for. Bought this mattress dec 28, 2018 and just threw it out on nov 30, 2020. It developed a huge indent, in the beginning the top foam layer felt good (for about half a year) and then all I could feel were the springs. My boyfriend and I aren't even heavy people and we couldn't take it anymore after not even 2 years. (I'm 130lbs and he's 160lbs). I would not recommend this mattress. Before buying it I read a bunch of reviews that were positive. I realize now that all of those positive reviews are from people who wrote them right after they received the mattress. At first it did feel like a good mattress to me as well but it's not worth it in the long run",1
10/9/2023,"I do not like this mattress. I thought I just had to get used to it, but three months in and I'm not a fan. I actually took this mattress off of my bed and put the old one back on. Id love to swap this one out for something better. This mattress is extremely hard and has 0 give. It's almost like sleeping on the floor. Way too firm.",1
12/20/2012,"Funny, I thought Mattress-In- a- Box ment a STANDARD mattress in a shipping carton.
Wow, what a surprise when it arrived in a box 32"" square by 54"" tall (APROX. SIZE)
Try to imagin rolling a STANDARD full mattress and then fitting it in a box that size.
As you can guess it doesn't have any support at all.
If it's for a light weight child, it might work.
HIND SIGHT: I should have watched the video.",1
11/23/2013,"I buy a lot of things from Walmart online and I always use the reviews to judge a good product from bad. I was fairly confident, considering the reviews that this matress would be fine, but alas! It's the sort of matress that if you push on the side it pushes right down. It was so bad on the slats that I moved I onto the floor and it still has no body to it. I just have to work out the return policy, I won't be able to fit it in the box and as I'm in manhattan, there is no walmart close by. A regretful buy",1
11/16/2013,"While the price is decent, once you unwrap your mattress in a box, it's smell will not go away for days.. Going on a week. The picture makes you believe you're getting a nice thick mattress but it's more thin and you can feel the springs when you touch it. Overall I feel like I could have saved my money and bought something better.",1
6/24/2014,"This mattress is awful. It is too soft to be usable. I can't sleep on it. I have even tried to use it under my old mattress as a boxspring base, but it's too soft for that, too. It's useless and I can't return it because it came with no paperwork and there's no way to get it back in the box. A total waste of money. Don't even try it.",1
6/30/2020,"Horrible Mattress. States extra firm but that is only true if you are a cat. This thing sinks in just by placing your hand on it while making the bed. What a waste of money. Not to mention the darn thing is shrinking. Literally it's shrunk and you can actually use the foundation as a step, no joke. Of course it can't be returned because it's been used. Beware, save your money, this is junk!",1
10/1/2014,"I received mattress sooner than I expected. Well packaged. Follow instructions. Let it set for 48 hrs before using it. Use it twice and will be returning it by the end of the week. Mattress does not stay firm, once you sleep on it it bends in and does not go back to its form. Very uncomfortable. I guess you get what you pay for.",1

12/29/2023,"There is no correspondence regarding errors on recent orders on Walmart behalf.
Being lied to repeatedly by several associates",1
10/21/2013,I can't believe how uncomfortable this mattress is! For the price I was expecting comfort. There is barely any cush between the springs and your body. Absolutely hate it!,1
4/29/2013,Stiff and uncomfortable. Bought two (2) mattress pads just to make it somewhat near able to sleep on. Would never buy this product again or recommend it.,1
9/20/2014,I would not purchase again. The coils shift around in the loose cover and there seems to be little padding. Even with the addition of a thick memory foam topper it is still very uncomfortable. I am going to return.,1
9/5/2016,Listen if you have any type of back problems do not purchase this mattress i am saving you i brought the platform the black metal frame to go with it and now i will have to buy another mattress it is a waste of money i am very very disappointed,1
4/21/2023,"Poor quality, i have purchases an 8 inch mattress and it seems like it doesn't go more than 4 inches from the corners and in the center it is around 6 inches. And when i sit or step on the mattress i feel the hard surface of my bed frame. Disappointed this time.",1
4/12/2023,"Terrible bed. It’s not even the right dimensions, it’s short 4 inches, and the sides don’t support the weight, it’s very uncomfortable, and after 3 days of use it already has like indentations where we sleep, can’t feel the memory foam, only springs… don’t waste your money on this…",1
2/2/2024,"dont me wrong sit okay, but not good for youre back....",1
2/23/2020,Weve had our mattress for 8 months and its sinking in where we sleep. We have a box spring. Together we definitely weigh under the weight limit. Would not recommend. I was hoping to have the mattress for a while but now thats not the case. Hard to see in the pictures.,1
3/26/2013,i slept on the mattress 3 nights total tghe first two nights i felt like the coils were exposed i could feel them all night.they werent they just feklt that way.i did not hardly sleep.the third night i put a thick blanket on top of mattress to lay on.i didnt feel the coils.the material of the mattress did not look sturdy at all.my personal opinion the mattress felt like coils covered in paper.i dont think mit would have held up long at all.i was just veryb disappointed in it all the way around i definetly would not recommend this.,1
11/25/2013,"I have another memory foam mattress that I love. This one is a big disappointment. Like others who reviewed before me, I would return if it wasn't impossible to repackage. It has ""springs"" inside,
not a nice thick foam mattress. The foam portion is thinner than the memory foam topper I had on the old mattress.",1
9/13/2014,"I was impressed with how easy this mattress was to transport, and upon opening it I was pleased with how quickly it expanded and how soft it felt at first. After laying down to bed I noticed within an hour how little support it had, I was sinking in more at my hips than my torso and had lower back pain by the end of the night; after two nights I knew I would need to buy a different mattress. I was really astounded at how little support it had, I am only 95 pounds and found that this mattress had far too much give. I feel as though I shouldn't be surprised as I picked this mattress based solely off the fact that it came in an easy to move box, but I was seriously disappointing.",1
11/24/2022,This bed is rock hard!! I went with it bc it was all I could afford and I regret it. I'm going on month two and everything hurts. I want to return but I don't have a way to deliver it. The second I get enough money I'm throwing it outside and getting a better bed,1
9/8/2019,Slept on it once yes its comfortable however i will be returning it. It has a strong mildew odor. Its been 3 weeks sitting in a room propped up on a wall with open windows to try and air out the strong odor. If i close that room window then the smell intensifies and spreads to the rest of the house . The room stinks and am hoping the odor wont linger once this mattress is returned . Now to rent a truck to return this,1
11/11/2023,They didnt leave it at my door they left it on the side walk.. anyone couldve walked away with it.. highly disappointed,1

11/19/2013,is not worth the price... is to soft...and being crushed into a box does not help the springs at all!!!!!!!!!!!!,1

springs! Horrible will not even put small children on it",1

8/26/2023,"Bumpy, rough, noisy and no support. I would have given no stars but the system required me to pick one.",1
7/14/2023,Damage when getting out of box! Now trying to figure out how to return it since I'm disabled! I'm sure if not a damaged item it would be ok.,1
4/8/2023,My item is supposed to arrive from the 2nd to the 4th of April but it's already 7 and it still hasn't arrived and they didn't refund my money either. I'm very upset. No one gives me a solution to my situation.,1
11/6/2023,this did not fit. Waiting for it to be picked up for refund.,1

1/8/2019,"Was amazing at first. Bought in June for my teen son who had outgrown his single bed, and he said it was amazing. Itâs Jan now, and LAST NIGHT he just informed me he hasnât been able to sleep well anymore bc of the hole. His back hurts every morning.  Hole? He said it was from âsleeping in the same spot.â I figured he was exaggerating and went to see. There is a crevice like dent in the middle of the bed. I canât flip it or afford to replace it. 

Please - can this be replaced?",1
3/21/2021,"It's so hard I feel like I'm sleeping on the floor.  there is no support at all and just caused so much pain in my legs, back, and ribs. when I read the reviews a few people said it was a bit firm but still good. WRONG. It is hard as a rock and terrible. My husband didnt have any back pain until one night of sleeping on this thing and now its pain central.  if you have any type of leg pain or hip problems like I do then this thing is not what you wanna get.",1
12/12/2016,Was very happy with mypurchase at first  but after following the directions letting it lay flat for 48 hours then slept on it the mattress is very firm too firm great if you're a back sleeper but if you sleep on your side like I do it's like sleeping on a pile of bricks,1
9/30/2014,"Queen mattress set actually was only one mattress and developed lumps after first night it was slept on. The same thing happened with both twin mattresses. I am very disappointed in the products and I feel that it is not worth the money I spent for it.

The so called Jumbo pillows I ordered were actually regular size pillows!",1
4/10/2020,"With sadness, I have to say that it's too short. The specs say it's 75"" long, but really it's 72"" long. First thing to change is to provide an actual length (and width) in the product description.

In the picture the mattress is not even pushed to the forward of the bed.

Other than that I can't say anything about its comfort, since this is going back to store :(",1
7/30/2022,"how it get all these postive reviews. 
worest matters ever i followed all the instructions 
to leave it for 3 days and after opened to leave it for 2 days to complete its shape but it looks like the wave there is up and down in the mattress not only when i sleep on it but also when you leave the bed it still have this shape. 
i dont know how to return it",1
2/25/2014,"Don't buy this mattress if you ever plan on sleeping on it. Poorly made and it comes folded (yes, folded) up inside of a box. I've seen mattresses on sleeper sofas that were more comfortable. I purchased this for an eight year old & it wasn't suitable for her....much less an adult. Took back to Walmart for a refund.",1

I've been biten 11 times on legs and have 8 bites on one arm. All bites just showed up 3days ago.",1
6/20/2014,"I was hoping that this would be a decent mattress for my son. We only need it for approx 6 to 9 months so I didn't want to pay alot. Well I don't feel we go our monies worth. The mattress is NOT 8 in, and we let it rest for the required time. It's also very uncomfortable with hardly any padding/cushioning over the springs let alone no side support which causes it to wobble a lot. Not a good buy!!!",1
2/4/2021,"Described as extra firm. It is not extra firm. Maybe I was sent the wrong one. It is soft.
Our old king mattress was very soft, giving me back aches and head aches, causing me to wake up often during the night. I slept in our guest bedroom for a week and this mattress is firmer. I slept great with no pains and aches, actually slept through the night.  This  Zinus mattress is a little firmer than our old one but still soft. I contacted the seller the day after delivery and here, a week later, I have no solution offered. I contacted Walmart and they will issue a refund. Going somewhere else today to buy a firm mattress.",1
6/29/2014,"I have one for 2 weeks and I am noticing the foam lifting in the middle of the bed. I was happy with it initially and amazed it came in a box, but it now looks like the mattress I just threw out for the same bulges but it was because of age. Not a brand new mattress. I wouldn't buy another one or tell a friend to get it.",1
4/13/2020,"Definitely not firm. I sit on it and it sinks all the way to the bottom. Very very soft. I'm stuck with this. I did not expect much at this price, hoping it would do for a few months, but this?? And how am I to return it? It came in a box. I will admit this and warn you. I let it sit for a few days due to the Corona Virus and other reasons. After I open the box, mind you AFTER I unpack it, it states to open immediately as it may affect it expanding to it's fullest capacity. I does look like it expanded fully and I waited 48 hours before sitting on it. Anyway, nice statement. And how long did it sit before I got it.",1

10/19/2022,"hi, the item was very good, but the delivery person delivered it down stairs itself. our house is in 2nd floor and we had to carry the heavy mattress upstairs, which was very difficult. we order delivery only because we can't carry the mattress 2 floors up, it would be helpful if this doesn't happen again.",1

10/1/2016,"I ordered this for my parents house when my fiance and I come visit.  It inflated just fine and we waited two days but is incredibly uncomfortable.  Each night we woke up with back Spasms and pain.  I don't see any flaws with the mattress itself like other reviews state (bugs, springs, lumps, etc) but with the high rating, I expected at least marginal comfort.  I cannot recommend this to others based on our experience.",1
11/3/2022,"The shipping box did not mention Hybrid, or Zinus, so I wasn't sure it was correct item . Did not want to open because the mattress expands and I would not be able to get it back down my stairs. Also had huge warning on box, not mentioned in ad, as well as that it was made in Indonesia.",1
3/18/2017,I bought this mattress because of the excellent reviews. I tried to deal with it for 2 weeks hoping it just needed to expand or something. It only got worse as time went on. It was like sleeping on a cement floor. I've never in my life felt so terrible getting out of bed and I've never lost sleep due to a mattress until I had this one. I rolled it back up and returned it.,1
2/28/2023,"Description online and on the box said it was 75” long but it is only 72” and does not fit a standard twin size frame. There's a large three inch gap. Not only that, it does not feel like it is a hybrid mattress or like there is any memory foam included, I can feel every single spring and it's very uncomfortable. Will be returning.",1
7/29/2016,"The mattress itself seems fine. EXTREMELY disappointed in the shipping pass option. The ENTIRE reason we bought these was to get two day shipping. We received the bed in two days, sheets in 3 days and this mattress 2 WEEKS LATER. No communication on why there was a delay. Will probably stick to Amazon Prime.",1
2/24/2023,"We bought this in December and returned in November as the spring was hurting on back and was getting back pain. I returned this mattress on 01/25, which they received on 01/26. Today is the 02/24 which is almost a month and I am still struggling to get the refund of the mattress. I have to keep calling every 3 to 4 days to get the refund and each time they says “we are processing”. Worst service ever. Save your money, time and health. Don't waste it on this third party product as your money not coming back.",1
12/30/2021,This mattress was great before anyone slept on it. It's in my guest room and has been slept on maybe 5 times over the course of 2 months by a very petite person and has a huge dip in the middle of it. The bed frame and box spring are brand new along with the mattress and this is what's happening.,1
1/14/2022,"If we could give this zero stars, we would. I don't understand all the good reviews. We bought a full size for our daughter, 3, and even she can't sleep on it. We've never had so much back pain from a mattress in our lives. And memory foam?? Where? It's a hard, unforgivable, mattress with no comfort level what so ever. Will be returning asap.",1
9/7/2021,"I do not care much for this mattress I ordered it because it said it was firm, put upon receiving it Im very disappointed it's causing me severe back problems more than normal. I would not recommend this to anybody but have back problems such as arthritis for lower back pain I definitely would not recommend slumber 1 by zinus 8"" quilted pocket spring mattress twin size at all",1
11/30/2020,"Update to my previous review where I rated this mattress highly. This mattress was for my daughters college apartment. It was great at first, although very soft. Now after 3 months of use the mattress is obviously sagging in the middle and is very uncomfortable. My daughter weights 120 lbs. so disappointing, I wanted it to last at least one year. Waste of my money.  Wish U had taken a picture of the dip when we picked her up for Thanksgiving. Believe me, it is a very obvious dip.",1
9/17/2019,"Bought in Feb 2017. Within the 1st year, it was sunken where I lie. After 2 years, I have daily backache. Zinus 10 yr warranty terms requires this mattress to be used on the correct platform, but they DO NOT TELL YOU WHAT THAT IS! I wrote Customer support, asking what the correct platform is. They responded with request for date of purchase, model number, retailer, etc...STILL did not answer my question. I replied again asking  what Zinus requires as the correct platform. They told me to contact Walmart.com with any further questions.  I guess that's the next step, since Zinus doesn't stand behind the 10 yr warranty they advertise so proudly.",1

9/13/2017,"The mattress brought bed bugs inside the plastic of the mattress . The first night, I did not see anything but the next day, my family's visit woke up with stings. I looked the bed and it had bugs. That's why I rate only 1 star. Incredible, but true. The good thing is that Walmart refunded me my money but it is good always to keep in mind to looked the mattress very carefully . It does not matter the place where you buy.",1

5/14/2020,Not very happy. This mattress is not padded on both sides. Not worth the money. I will be returning it.,1
7/6/2021,This was supposed to be firm but its like sleeping on a half inflated cheap blow up mattress. Low quality material.,1
9/17/2016,No padding. You feel the slats from the bed right through the mattress.  My son complains that he has a back ache every morning and can not sleep.,1
7/7/2013,I thought from the picture this would be a full size mattress in a full size box. It is a folded piece of memory foam in a small box. I returned it.,1

9/6/2022,"If i can give a minus 5 i would give it. 
This is a spring matress in a box. It has 0 support. It has protruding springs when you sleep. Omg what were they thinking? I wouldn't place my dog to sleep on this.",1

7/20/2019,After three months of use mattress started to not hold its shape and sinks in where i would lay...(i weigh 125lbs.) back is hurting and have purchased new mattress.,1
7/9/2021,Contains fiberglass within lining of mattress. Don't buy. Springs loose there shape and it sags and gets lumpy. Waste of money and no good to your health if it rips like ours did.,1
7/26/2020,"Not firm at all! Very disappointed but cant expect too much for the price. Mattress was very easy to set up and convenient to be able to bring up to vaca cottage, but it is very bouncy. Wish it were extra firm like described.",1
1/1/2021,Awful bed! We've had this mattress for 1 year exactly and it has a sink in hole in the center. It's super uncomfortable. My husband and I wake up crippled every morning. I do not recommend this bed. It's seriously awful.,1
8/10/2016,My daughter is miserable. It's so hard and doesn't give at all. I don't know what to do now. Can I return a mattress? I have no clue how to even get it back to Walmart.,1

4/11/2019,the end of the bed is so sunken in in under two months. very disappointed.,1
4/8/2016,"I bought this mattress for my guest bedroom. And the person I bought this for, complained that sleeping in this causes backache. The next day I tried the mattress myself, and it was really a bad experience (even for 30 mins). I am honestly confused about the positive reviews. Not sure whether I alone got such a bad piece. Will be contacting walmart to return this.",1
2/23/2016,"You get what you pay for. This mattress was horrible. It gave me the worst back and neck pain. The middle sunk in after just a few short weeks. I tried everything to make it better, but it was overall a cheap, worthless mattress. I could feel the springs poking and prodding my body, with every turn, it squeaked. Do not buy this mattress. Spend money on a good, quality mattress.",1
8/23/2013,"I have been in question from the start. 1: the foam is so thin it was not noticeable.
2: the spring do not bounce back, therefore it sits with the
imprint.
I am using the mattress on a twin as a Day Bed in the living room. Bad appearance
I was under the impression (mattress in a box ) it didn't require a box spring. ( misleading)",1
9/2/2017,"Ordered in June and now it is September 1st. One side has sunk in badly and sore to lay on. I am sure the other side will sink in at some point.  Did not last 3 months. I will not be ordering this again. I will not be recommending this to anyone on Earth.  The weight of the one sleeping on it, was around 200 pounds. Mattress of this size, should hold more weight than that.",1
1/20/2012,"This mattress felt great for the first couple months but has slowly become a nightmare. There are no springs on the edges of the mattress which gives no support. The springs are moving around inside the bed which creates uncomfortable spots and you can actually feel and hear the popping around at night, waking us up. After 4-6 months my back feels like it has been twisted, we went out and spent three times the amount we paid for this mattress but I am sleeping at night now, much better.",1
1/27/2017,"We bought this bed for our teenage son who is not overweight and does not jump on beds like a small child. The bed was purchased on 2/15. So time has passed and the bed is used daily. I would not purchase this bed again. Last summer the coils broke on one side of the bed. Right where you would sit on the edge of the bed in the middle section. We bought a full size so if he sleeps in it, he has to sleep on the one side only because it has a huge divot in the middle on the opposite side. I would not purchase this bed again as the price does not justify the warranty. I emailed the company so I am hoping they replace it and we will see if his bed was just defective.",1
7/15/2012,Because most of the ratings were so high I decided to take a chance and buy this for my 7 year old who weighs only 52lbs. We layed the matteress out for a few days as we waited delivery of her full size bed. This bed is not worth it. Spend another $100 and get a bed with springs. Only my small daughter has sleep on this and just after only a week it has so many dipped spots in the mattress I can't even count and they won't go away. I'm taking this back to Walmart tomorrow. Not worth your time or money.,1
2/23/2016,"I wanted to get a mattress for my short term stay in United States, with over 5k reviews i thought this is the best and it was affordable too. But now for 3 months we are sleeping on it and its becoming more and more uncomfortable. Me and my husband both are getting back pains which we don't usually get. Some areas on mattress are puffing up. Soon need to buy another one. I don't understand how so many people are loving it that much.I had King size and I wont recommend to a friend.",1
1/2/2011,"My husband and I got this because we are students living on a campus and won't be here long so we got something that we could throw away when we move. I want to throw it away NOW! It says it's guaranteed for 1000 nights. First night was fine, second night wasn't so great, third night we bought a foam mattress pad for it. We're not even to night 100 and it's giving me the worst back pain I have had since getting the epidural when my daughter was born! Total excruciating pain! The springs create pressure points, and the ""pillow top"" isn't even fully attached so it bunches up in a giant hill in the middle of the bed. What money we saved by buying this vs a regular bed will be spent on a trip to the chiropractor!",1
1/9/2016,i have purchased a lot of quality products from walmart but this is not one of them i don't know where all these positive reviews about this mattress is coming from unless i got stiffed in my order and someone switched mattresses on me. this mattress i got it came rolled up like they said and i waited at least 48 hours the mattress started sinking in the middle in about three weeks. the coils gave me great aches. lots of tossing and turning trying to get comfortable. i ended up going back to sleeping in my reclining chair. this mattress is absolutely junk and i tell no lies i may take a quick nap on it. during the day if i'm home and even then not long. i would say mainstays is much better and it was only a six inch mattress a lot better th...,1
8/25/2012,"First off, let me say this is a BEAUTIFUL pillow-top-looking mattress. It's very impressive looking and appeared to be well constructed and pretty substantial, not to mention amazingly convenient. Follow the easy instructions and within minutes you have a normal-size mattress. My chief complaint is that it was very uncomfortable. I prefer a firm mattress, but this was waaay too firm--even with its very nice padding. I really wanted this to work, because it was affordable, easy to manuever, and again, very attractive. But no go. Fortunately, Walmart.com was FANTASTIC with the refund. But you must call Walmart.com ahead, because mattresses are oversized items that require different return/refund procedures than other purchases. You can't take...",1
12/16/2016,"I purchased a full size version and at first i was very happy, helped my back pain and also let me sleep all night, it was very comfortable. 

The first matress i had lasted about 8 months and began to sink in the center, i eventually replaced it under warranty as it was making my back hurt pretty bad.

The second one is about 6 months old and begining the same issue.

I originally purchased this matress because of the 10 year warranty, but with all the hastle of disposing of a matress every 8 months is not worth the warranty...

This matress is not worth buying if you want an everyday sleeper, waste of money and a waste of time like so many other products at walmart lately...

All your buying here is aggrivation, i will not reccomend this ...",1
3/10/2014,"I buy this mattress online after reading almost all the reviews about it. After sleeping one night on it i have to said this is the most unconfortable mattress ever. I just waste my money, how come so many people said it like it. Did you people even sleep on it or you just buy this mattress for your kids or guests maybe some of you should sleep on it and then write a review. ( I hope I can returned this to store since the mattress is unpack.)",1

I have only had it for 3 days and it has already sunk in and isn't comfortable at all... She tells us that she doesnt like her bed because it hurts her back. I am returning this asap and getting a new one for her...
I would reccomend paying a little extra for a quailty mattress... This really wasn't worth the $129 plus tax that I spent on it. I am very disappointed in this mattress...",1
8/1/2017,"I am disappointed after reading all the great reviews about this mattress - mine isn't great at all. It sags in middle & I thought it would ""adjust"" after a few days, but it's been about 3 weeks and it is not good. I am only 135 pounds, single - so there has been no heavy weight on it at all. And the returning of it is a joke, they said to ""wrap it"" and put a label on it. Really? Fed Ex wants to deal with a FULL SIZE mattress to pick up?? Very disappointed..",1
2/27/2012,After receiving the bed i opened the box & let the bed spread out this was neat. I slept on the bed 2 days later & now i wish i'd spent my money on something better!!!! This bed is very uncomfortable & i would not waste my money on it!!!! The frame is cheap & flimsy the mattress is awful!! If your considering buying this setup please reconsider & spend a little more money to get a better quality bed!!,1

6/19/2013,"I will say you'll get a great sleep on this mattress as it is very soft and comfortable. i got it for my daughters twin bed. however, within 4 months of usage, with me or my husband (200lbs) sleeping on it once/twice a month, the mattress is SAGGIng terribly in the middle. i've tried rotating it but nothing has helped. The mattress is on another thinner mattress so has sufficient support.
very disappointed:( can't even return it. want my money back!!!!",1
9/13/2014,"I was a little skeptical of the product for the price and when it arrived rolled up in a box, I was even more skeptical. If you don't care about feeling the coils, this may be the mattress for you. Needless to say, we have returned the product and will be spending more money on a better quality mattress. Was really hopeful, but not worth it.",1
7/12/2017,"I bought king mattress about a week ago along with the low profile box spring.  The box spring arrived a few days late then promise but, I was still excited especially from all the good reviews. This mattress sinks in four different places. I read one bad review and I have to agree. My husband really hates it. Thankfully we have a truck so we will be reurning it.  I also bought full and twin mattresses for my kids room and they are comfortable.  The king mattress just didn't feel comfortable at all. Don't waste your time then you have to go through the hassle of returning a big mattress.",1
3/10/2016,"After reading the reviews on this mattress my husband and I thought it would be perfect. WRONG!
This might be comfortable for one really skinny person (maybe) but it is absolutely HORRIBLE for 2 normal size adults. It sags on whatever side the heavier person is sleeping on, and you can feel the plastic coils even through a 6 inch gel foam topper.
We are now sleeping on just a box spring with the gel foam topper, and although it's not that comfortable, it beats the heck out of sleeping on that mattress. Just a heads up for any couples contemplating purchasing this mattress.",1
9/15/2013,"I ordered this mattress a couple of years ago and loved it, but they must have changed this mattress so beware. It is not firm and way too soft, I was very disappointed and would not recommend this Slumber 1, in a box to anyone....I am trying to return it for a refund.....not happy.",1
6/3/2015,I read the reviews and made the purchase based on everyone's reviews. I have been really successful with making purchases this way. The mattress is very flimsy and you feel like you are falling off of it when you sit on the side of the bed. We were extremely disappointed and returned it. I do not recommend this product even for a child.,1

Once you open it up, it takes a few hours for the mattress to decompress. There is a distictive odor coming from it. It smells like fish and oil. I have had it about a month now, the smell has dissapated but it's still there. I tried several deodorizers, they help, but I can still smell it.",1
7/15/2015,"While it was remarkable to see how they are able to roll a mattress up into a long box that's only about 5"" square, it was not what I was hoping for.

The cushioning would work for a tiny child who doesn't weigh much. But this was for myself & guests who weigh enough that it compacts what little stuffing there is down to the springs.

Perhaps with a thick mattress topper - as long as you already have one.",1
6/11/2014,I bought this mattress for my 2 year old daughter for her first big girl bed. It is not firm at all and she is falling down when she lays on the side- rolling down.

If you buy this product be prepard for the springs to rise up in your side or back and buy a mattress cover before you get a good nights sleep. The saying goes that ""you get what you pay for"" is certainly is true in this instance.",1
6/4/2012,"After reading positive reviews, I had high expectations. Big mistake. WAY too soft. We sank way into the bed and woke up every morning for two weeks straight with sore backs. I missed two days of work because of the soreness.

Not worth it. Didn't like the Sleep Science memory foam mattress either. Developed lumps and caused uneven sleeping.",1

Me being the person I am, I hope for the best and give things a chance. Well I wish I wouldn't have been so cheap and spent the extra $100 when the Serta was on sale at Sam's Club!! ughhhhh I honestly regret buying this mattress!",1

I was NOT!! used to being told that Fed-Ex would not deliver this 50 lb. item to my door. It was left at the apartment managers office, and I was expected to come get it. and carry it 50 yards and then climb the flight of stairs to get it into my apartment. SO!!, I ended having to pay one of the guys in the complexes' dept. $20 to do this for me.

I would have also purchased a Magic Chef 2.1 cuft. washing machine. But since that weighs 100 lbs. I will have to look elsewhere and find someone who will deliver it to my doorway.",1

I guess you get what you pay for.",1

They claim to have a 10 yr warranty on these mattress, but it's like pulling teeth to try to get any results about how to get a refund.  I had to purchase a new (better) mattress for her and am still trying to figure out what to do about this one.  I am VERY disappointed in this mattress.",1
3/3/2017,This is my second time purchasing a matress  from Walmart the first one I had to trew it oway  the mattress had fiber glass and it got all over my house and clothes and it was a nightmare i decided to purchase this one well I flashed my light on this one and what did I see fiberglass I looked at the tag and it's says 30% procent is made out of fiber glass I will have to throw this one oway to i will be not purchasing no more mattress from Walmart the price is good but it's not worth my health and trust me once the fiber glass gets on clothes you will have to trow all your clothes oway you can't wash the fiber glass out of clothes no matter how many times you wash it,1

First i tried to sleep i couldn't sleep more then 3 hours because it's very hard surface i felt like sleeping on the floor even my guests didn't like it so if your body like hard surface then it's nice mattress for you I'm talking about extremely hard that's what it stand for.  I never bought a mattress online  before now on never even going to think about buying a mattress online just not a good idea :(",1
7/17/2016,"""What do you mean, popcorn? This is a mattress!"" you say.


Well, I say it's popcorn because it's a lot like a bag of microwave popcorn. You take it out of the box and it pops up like popcorn.  It seems like a neat idea at first, until you sleep on it. 

My old mattress was feeling, well... old, and a bit lumpy. So I was in the market to get a new one. After looking at the pricing on getting a new bed, which means buying both a mattress and box spring at any decent place, I realized I just didn't have the budget for that.

So I looked into this. I looked at all the positive reviews. I mean, nearly 5000, with an average rating of almost 5 stars. So I thought it's got to be fairly decent.

But after two months of sleeping on this thing, I hav...",1
6/13/2016,The frame is week. Its not good for all the matresses. Woods in the frame are thin and make the bed unstable. There should be a bed frame to hold the matress and that would make the structure more stable. I would sure return the bed if i had not thrown away the packaging before setting the bed. I regret the purchase.,1
7/23/2012,"I took a chance on ordering a new mattress without trying it out first. Probably not the best idea.
Ordering online was easy. Delivery came quicker than estimated.

I used it for almost a week just to be sure I liked it.
I didn't.

I personally like a firm mattress and from the one star reviews I read on here from people complaining about how hard the mattress was I figured I'd try it out.
It isn't firm at all. It's like laying on a thick comforter.

The build quality seemed fine. The mattress itself looks like a regular mattress once it opens up fully.
If you like a really soft mattress then you'll love it. If you're looking for something a lot more firm then this wouldn't be it.",1
7/4/2014,"We read the reviews and they were all great, so we bought this mattress last summer. What are we doing a year later? Looking for another mattress. It was a cool idea, you get the mattress in a box and it was neat watching it ""inflate"" when you cut the seal. It was also very comfortable, nice looking and a good bed. Then after a few months it started to ""sag"" in spots. We have huge ""sink holes"" all in the bed, where we have turned it trying to find a more comfortable position. This thing is awful! We are now suffering the worst pain, lower back, shoulders, and hips. Save your money and buy something else.",1

THREE WEEKS LATER I WENT TO VISIT MY DAUGHTER IN FLORIDA. MY GRANDDAUGHTERS MATTRESS WAS HORRIBLE SO I ORDERED THIS FOR HER AND HAD IT SHIPPED TO HER HOME IN FLORIDA. WHILE THERE, I SLEPT ON IT FOR 2 WEEKS. BEFORE I LEFT, IT ALREADY HAD SUNK IN IN THE MIDDLE. THIS IS JUNK. I WILL BE RETURNING MINE TO MY LOCAL WALMART STORE. I AM ADVISING MY DAUGHTER TO DO THE SAME.",1
10/7/2020,"The mattress itself is okay as far as comfort level... a little on the firm side, but not terribly uncomfortable; however, we have been living a bed bug nightmare and the ONLY factor is this mattress!  Regretting this purchase to the umpteenth degree :(",1
3/16/2015,"I relied on all the reviews and purchased this mattress in a full size. That was a horrible mistake. This mattress is not even fit to use for an occasional guest. When you sit on it, it sinks like a cheep mattress. When you lay on it, it is extremely noisy. You can actually hear all the coils creaking. Not a little - a lot! There is no way 2 adults can sleep on this thing. Wal-Mart needs to discontinue this ridiculous item. Please in the future, keep your reviews honest. I can't believe I'm the only one who received a noisy flimsy mattress. I bought the Slumber 1-8"" Mattress in a Box. I'm wondering if all those wonderful reviews on that mattress were posted to the wrong item.",1
3/30/2015,"2 YEAR REVIEW! Was good for 6 months and actually did relieve my nagging lower back pain caused by my existing mattress. I weigh 200 lbs. Then the middle started to sag and before long rolls began appearing above and below the sag across the mattress. Today, 2 years later, I am choking on whatever made me believe in a 5 year warranty as my purchase decision. This mattress is headed to the side of the road for the trash hauler. Lesson learned.",1
4/2/2023,No one never contacted me about my Merchandise and I don't think that is ok,1
11/20/2022,Not firm at all. Sat on it and it went to the floor. Suitable for young children but not adults.,1

8/5/2020,"I really wish I could give it a NEGATIVE five stars!  The only good things about it was the package it arrived in,",1
7/14/2021,Per the box this mattress is flammable and made of urethane. If it catches fire it will spread rapidly. That is not okay and shouldnt be sold,1
7/24/2020,Bed didnt inflate all the way. I can feel every spring. Ordered this 3 years  ago no issues now Im in excruciating back pain,1

9/28/2022,Bought this mattress 6 months ago. It now has springs popping up in the mmiddle. Horrible mattress. Do not buy!,1

11/24/2014,This bed is terrible. I have a slumber 1 10 inch pillow top bed and love it but this bed is horrible. I like a firm bed but this is like nothing I have ever seen. It is like laying on concrete. I would not recommend this to anyone.,1
6/28/2014,"Description should simply say bunk bed mattress not make it look the same depth as a normal mattress. So dissappointing, customers depend on descritions of products so when they are misleading it is frustrating.",1
1/7/2012,we bought this queen size mattress for my 20 year old son. After 2 nights the mattress was already saggy. We brought it back to walmart the next day. Do yourself a favor and buy a real mattress !,1
6/10/2021,Deplorable shipment received ... Box re-sealed with what appears to be a used mattress inside.  No one wants someone else's returned mattress.  Not sanitary.  Trashed it.,1
12/22/2012,"Due the individual coil construction, if you are heavy, it gives you a feel of sleeping in a 10 year old mattress. I got it just yesterday. Had a bad sleep and a painful back this morning. I do plan on returning it.",1
7/30/2011,"This mattress looks great ,but just to look.I used it for hardly 2 weeks now n got back pain.So now i am returning this. Might be this may be a good mattress for a kid, but definitely not for adults to support their weight!",1
11/21/2014,The picture you see in the website ad the product you receive are completely different. The matress is very thin and small. It says king but it is not. Please spend $600 and get a real matress.,1

The picture is deceiving, I returned it on the spot.",1
6/3/2021,Not a good mattress for me. It gave me really bad backaches. I have been able to sleep peacefully! I wouldnt recommend this product! I tried to return it and they wouldnt take it! Very bad,1
5/25/2017,After less than a year with only one person sleeping on it the bed is sagging in multiple places make it uncomfortable to sleep on and almost impossible to get a full nights sleep. I don't recommend this mattress at all!!,1
5/6/2013,2 months in and its not holding up to its 1500lbs guarantee it has dipped greatly and it has not bounced back. Not to mention it makes me sweat at night.,1
10/5/2017,"This item has ants within the mattress, I have noticed them all over it, when I kill them, more appear (hundreds thusfar)- they are very small/slow moving.  I am grossed out - the mattress is filled with them.  I am getting rid of this ASAP.",1
3/25/2018,"When I opened it up and took it out of the plastic seal, it smelled like mold/mildew. I can not use it. It smells terrible.  I let it air out for a week and it still stinks.",1

7/22/2014,"I stood up on the finished bed mattress to put up a curtain rod for my daughter and the bed slats broke with the mattress ending up in the floor.
Cheap cheap cheap. No real wood. The particle board is very soft. Waste of money.",1

3/2/2021,"Wanted a queen not a Twin, can't wait to get my refund. I spent the last $64 for something that is not right now I can't even pay my rent and just moved here on the 27th of February",1
10/27/2020,The mattress was comfortable for the first month or so and then it started bowing in the middle. I have rotated it a few times. This would be a good mattress for a spare bedroom that isnt used daily.,1
4/8/2014,when I received this it was rolled up in a box. I thought by looking at picture it was going to be a regular mattress. I will be returning this product.,1

wish I could had seen it in person. Expecting a more wider mattress....",1
7/30/2014,"The mattress looked nothing like its picture on the website, it arrived in a small box, rolled up like a small round bale of hay. It was thin and definitely not what we were expecting. We asked for a refund right on the spot.",1
11/16/2014,"This item is listed at 75 inches long. We ordered three of them and found each one to be 73 inches. It proved to be significant on our loft beds, creating an unsafe gap. We returned them.",1
11/23/2012,I bought this mattress soley on reading the reviews and am so sorry I did.It is awful!! no support and you slide off it if you sit on the edge of the mattress.I can not believe it was so bad considering the cost DON'T purchase it !!,1
6/28/2013,"I wouldn't even call this a mattress. It comes

it to walmart immediately and went to a real
mattress store and got a pretty nice mattress
for the same price. Definitely would not recommend
this one!",1
5/5/2012,"It had body prints and did not recover loft after the first night. I added a memory foam topper which did not help. Save your money and ""spring"" for a real mattress.",1

3/11/2015,"I am not sure who writes these reviews, but I received this bed and it is very uncomfortable. Ok if you are looking for a firm mattress. The worst thing about it is that now that I found out that I hate it, I can't even return it because it will never go back into the original packaging. Think long and hard before you buy, if you don't like the bed, you will be throwing your money in the trash like I did!",1
4/30/2015,"I probably should have stopped when the mattress arrived in a box. That should have been enough to warn me that it was not going to be a ""firm"" sleep surface. Unwisely I opened the box, allowed the mattress to unfold and rest for 24 hours, and then put it on my box springs. The first night was miserable because there was no support for my body.
Not for me, but someone who likes a really soft mattress would be satisfied. For me it was a waste of money",1
8/27/2015,"I bought this mattress 6 months ago, initially it was good with my body while sleeping since all spring seems to be shaping my body correctly. Soon I started seeing springs are getting loose and no more form to hold your body while sleeping. In last 3 months, I started realizing that every morning my back and body is hurting too much. I would not recommend this product as it may cause issues in your back.",1
10/24/2015,"I recently purchased this mattress since the foam mattress I was using was not providing proper back support. This mattress arrived quickly. Once I got it I opened it and let it properly form to its original shape. I noticed right away that one of the corners of the mattress The springs hadn't properly decompressed. This was the first troubling thing that happened with the mattress. The first night of rest on it wasn't bad, but when I woke up the next morning I noticed the mattress had started to sag in the area that I had slept on it. Luckily I contacted Walmart about a return and within 3 hours they had already refunded my purchase.",1
2/2/2015,"Everything went well with shipping, delivery and set-up was easy. Cool concept, however, unfortunately this mattress had been described as firm and it is about as far away from firm as you could possible get. Do not purchase this mattress if you need firm or even semi-firm. We bought it for our 20 y.o. son and he has had a sore back ever since the first night he slept on it.

And normally we would try to return or exchange an item we were that unsatisfied with, but we were not aware that it could not be taken to the local Wal-Mart for return or exchange.....it has to be shipped and we would be responsible for all the shipping costs. Sorry, but this was a bad deal all the way around.",1
2/11/2015,"We ordered this in a King size. When it was delivered it was in a box HALF the size of a twin mattress. Even the UPS driver was shocked that a king sized mattress was in the box it was and suggested we get it out of the box immediately. When we opened the box the SPRING mattress was folded in half and then rolled and vacuum packed into the plastic wrap and shoved into the box. I did not sleep well AT ALL, you can feel all the springs and the damage that was done from being boxed the way it was, and when I woke up this morning it felt like I had been punched in the back repeatedly. I had to go out and buy a mattress topper in hopes that I will be able to sleep somewhat comfortably.",1
4/21/2014,"We ordered this mattress, the firm and it is nothing short of a squishy soft horrible mattress. It hurts our backs, everyday wake up in pain. The mattress has no support and we role to the center everytime we sleep with no resolution to it. Horrible and waste of money.",1
1/16/2015,This is a very cheap mattress that I would take it back if I had a way to return it. But that saying is true u get what u pay for. I wish I had put the money towards a better mattress. There were do many reviews with negative nicknames I couldn't find one to usr. That says something about the quality of this mattress. Do not listen to the positive reviews. That is what I did and am very upset about it.,1
5/21/2016,Ita not a real mattress,1
11/24/2014,I ordered this mattress for my teenager. It looked great when it arrived. My month 2 it had a huge indentation in it where he sleeps.,1
7/4/2016,"The mattress is soft, Ordered with metal frame, Frame didn't get delivered for over 2 weeks. WalMart.com. is horrible to order from!",1
7/7/2020,"Very soft. Not extra firm. 
Not sure if it can be returned. Maybe not because it cannot be repackaged again after the box is opened. So don't buy it!",1
1/11/2017,This is not as firm as advertised. Not balanced and gives very uncomfortable sleep. Looking for alternate options within 2 weeks of purchase.,1
2/16/2015,"Cheap product, i felt that i was sleeping on coiles , i kept for 3 days and returned it to walmart righ away",1
7/23/2016,Not at all what. Expected.  Did not want springs in mattress.  Being returned as my back is killing me.,1
9/7/2012,I feel whole springs in mattress and every morning i wake up with a terrible back pain. I suggest you to buy another one...,1

9/2/2013,"This mattress performed fine at first, but after about five months, coils began collapsing and coming loose.",1
10/2/2016,"If you have back problems, this bed is a rock to sleep on. Whatever these pple said and rated it a 4 or 5 is crazy. Don't waste ur money.",1
9/12/2017,Bought this bed in 2015......Now horribly out of shape and sunken...Do not sit on the edge of the bed....No support....Very disappointed,1
7/30/2014,Is not a mattress and a box is literally a mattress inside a box So expect that and not a good quality,1
3/15/2014,I keep breaking out in really bad red rash from this mattress. Throat started to swell first time it happened.,1
4/3/2021,The bed is thin. It does not look like the bed in the picture. It's so thin that it can be rolled in a box. YES IT WAS SHIPPED IN A BOX.,1

8/28/2017,"I ordered this mattress hoping that it will provide better support. I'm a 34 year old man and a side sleeper. In the beginning this mattress was comfortable. But after few months, I starting feeling spring whenever i turn while sleeping. Then It start sagging. After 8 months of use, it started sagging and whenever I lay down on it, it feels like sinking. Whenever I sleep on this, I wake up with backache. I didn't expect this while purchasing this mattress.",1
2/7/2020,"I purchased this in July 2019, while approximately 7 1/2 months pregnant,  because my back was in a lot of pain with our 12 year old mattress. This new mattress has amazing reviews and I thought to myself ""nothing could be worse than what I'm al ready sleeping on"". Boy,  was I wrong?! I was so excited to try this mattress, but ended up crying the first night from all the pain and I could barely get out of bed in the morning.  I read online about needing a ""break in"" period. It nearly 8 months later and I'm still miserable and having pains just laying in the bed  ( although,  not waking up in tears anymore).  My husband dislikes the bed so much that he's taken to sleeping on the couch. We don't recommend this one at all, and we are looking f...",1
6/27/2014,"So I purchased this mattress after reading all of the raving reviews (which I am starting to think are fake). Last night was my first night sleeping on the mattress, and I was tossing and turning all night! My back is so sore this morning that I can barely walk. And the worst part is that I am stuck with this horrible product! There is no way I can repackage it myself and send back for a refund. What a waste of money...",1
5/3/2018,"I bought this for my son. Several of the springs are smushed and will not uncoil, which means my son has to sleep around several ""holes"". The only option I can see it to cut open the material and see how the springs are stuck and try to free them. The foam under the top covering is twisted. This mattress was not worth the money. I won't buy from this company again.",1
4/18/2020,"Back pain and body aches. Thought maybe I had to get used to it so I slept on it for a year and my pains got worse (couldnt even move my neck) So I leased a purple matress because I dont have money like that and Im cured. I realized I wasnt getting sleep on the Slumber Zinus 8 mattress, woke up with dark eyes every day and was so cranky with my kids and work. This purple mattress is magic. Im a 29 year old mom with 2 kids, I need my sleep!",1
6/6/2020,Watch out for bed bugs. I highly suggest to on roll the mattress out side. While unrolling in my bedroom seem little bugs. Live and dead. I called and they will not pay for exterminator. Just a discount on previous order 1st at 10% then up to 15%  you guys are not done hearing from me.,1
5/16/2015,This is basically a sheet with springs in it.,1
12/20/2013,wanted a twin mattress which is what you showed in the picture...not what you sent....,1

8/15/2014,I wasted my money on two of these mattress,1
1/13/2013,I found a mattress that was a lot nicer for less money at a mattress store.,1
9/22/2015,I bought it online and the mattress came with mold.,1
1/18/2015,This is my second one. The first one was great. The seconds one is not as good. I could feel the springs and it's not pillow top like the first one.,1
11/8/2015,I wake up with a sore back. The mattress is too hard. Wish it would have had said on the description what the firmness was.,1
4/8/2015,"I bought this recently after seeing lot of good reviews, the mattress is not firm at all. cheap quality.",1
8/19/2021,"You could feel the springs when you laid down. I even put a mattress pad on top to help and still had to return. Only get this mattress if you like sleeping on the ground, because that's what it feels like",1
7/10/2012,This mattress never fully got completely flat. It was almost like it had waves in it. Wasn't firm either. Returned it and bought a mattress/boxspring from somewhere else for almost the same price.,1
11/26/2014,I don't like this mattress one bit. You can feel the coils and it's not very comfortable. Just spend a little more and get something more comfortable.,1
5/26/2015,"One of the worst mattress, Cheap design/materials. Not comfortable. Save your money, add little bit more and buy something more reputable and trustworthy.",1
8/13/2019,This bed is the worse bed in the box. I do not suggest anyone purchasing this. It is extremely hard mattress. It's like sleeping on a hardwood floor! It actually makes your body hurt all over. If I was able to give 0 stars I would've. Not worth 5 bucks I'm pretty sure I won't even be able to give this mattress away. Came with a yellow stain in the corner of the mattress.  Very disappointed! I need to figure out how to send this thing back.,1
10/13/2012,"Bought this because the reviews were good and it wasn't worth the money I spent on it. I took it back the next day. It was a joke and a waist of my time.

I went to a local mattress store and bought one WAY!!! better for $50 more and I know it will last ALOT longer!!!

This mattress looked and felt very cheap and flimsy. The new one the other one I got was solid and was a pillow top.

Don't waist your money on this mattress!!!!",1
1/29/2020,Been looking forward to getting my kids mattress for their bunk bed and we got it today with a big old stain in the middle of the mattress that looks like pee stain! Urghh! Now we had to try to stick it back in the box while is not an easy task to do for a return which I think is impossible so I might even up not even able to return it,1
6/27/2019,"Horrible bed, I bought it a couple days before Christmas 2018, it's June 23 2019 and it's been causing me many restless nights to the point of I wake up with springs jabbing me and I get frustrated with being poked and stabbed and the sound if springs popping and get up out of bed, having said that..I have back problems and getting in bed, out of bed and comfy to begin with is a major task. So to be woken up in pain after I've taken my muscle relaxer and sleeping pill is probably the worst part of my night....no, realizing it's the only bed I can sleep in and having to get back into it is the worst part of my night.

This bed is so bad I had to buy 8 pillows to put under the bed sheet to act as a buffer between me and the bed. Pretty sure I...",1
3/15/2018,"My boyfriend bought this mattress for a gift because my old mattress sagged in the middle. And I suffered from hip and back pain a lot while we read a review about someone having  fibromyalgia and it stopped she love the mattress , So we ended up getting it, well I still suffer from hip pain and now I get back pAin, and know I have to live with this mattress and it sucks don't buy this mattress",1
5/8/2020,"I bought this mattress march 20, 2020
My first bed ever and i wanted to save money.. yall my back has been hurting soo bad. I went to my aunti house for the weekend and the pain went away. I been back in my apartment and the pain has started back up. Maybe you wont feel the back pain but i do. Im going to go get a foam mattress to put on top.. maybe i will feel better.",1
3/15/2017,"Bought this mattress is October of 2013. Writing now in March of 2017 to say the mattress has disappointed me in longevity. While it was firm, I weigh only 135 lbs and it has begun to sag in the center. The coils hurt whenever I shift in the mattress.

I will not be repurchasing this mattress from this company again.",1
1/11/2018,"I ordered this because of my arthritic knee. This felt soft for the first several days and then it became lumpy in spots and developed dents that would not fill in. That was for just a  light weight woman using it. We tried all kinds of mattress pads, but it just got worse and we quit using it. We got it out again in the fall to give it another try rather than buying a new one, but I woke up with all my joints aching. We are now waiting for a new Spa Sensations memory foam mattress to show up and we will take this lumpy  one to the dump after less than 6 months of total use. It was a big waste of money.",1
12/3/2019,"Its a story I never thought I would tell but I was beat up and tramples by a Zinus mattress. There were technically two of them. As I was cutting open the rolled up spring mattresses following the minimal instructions provided, I leaned down to view the sticker i noticed on the bottom and BANG!! they exploded from a roll to flat position in less than 1.5 seconds. I lost all control and fought with my life not to bang my head on the floor. I penetrated my neck witht the knife I was holding and hit my head on the wall. It knocked me at least 4-5 feet. We had two toddlers in a nearby room and I still have noghtmares about what might have happened if they had run by at that exact moment.  Be careful opening. I contacted the company twice with n...",1
8/26/2017,"I saw lots great reviews and it made to purchase this mattress. It was great for first couple months. 
Now 1 year later ""Tight top bed mattress with individual spring coils""  coils start collapsing.
Individual spring coils don't last at least in this product. 

If you need a mattress for 1 year like college time it's great.
If you need a mattress for the longer period it sucks.

I put here 1 star because I really hoped it will last at least 2 years.
full price what I paid was $220.20

6/17/2019,"this mattress was for my step daughter. we bought it 3 years ago. it's used, on average, 3 nights per week. we are replacing it today as each quarter of the mattress has sunk in. it's so significant that you can notice it with all the bedding on. terrible quality- not worth it.",1
8/6/2019,"DO NOT BUY. This is a very loud mattress and it will absolutely begin to sink in a few short months. Worst of all:  ZINUS will NOT honor their warranty even if you email photographs of your cardboard shipping box, purchase receipts, and the very obvious sink hole that spans across the entire bed. 

This mattress creeks and squeaks, which wakes me up when my husband gets out of bed, and he is awakened when I get out of bed.  I weigh 130 pounds and he weighs 180 pounds. 

Our backs hurt and our sleep is disrupted only because of this sunken and noisy mattress -- which began to sink more and more and more after about 3 months.

Your body deserves a real mattress that truly supports your spine. Do not buy a mattress from ZINUS. They will not ho...",1
11/4/2019,"This mattress is a product failure - I'm not even a hot sleeper, and this mattress is literally a furnace to sleep on!!  I sleep fine on any other mattresses in motels and hotels that I have slept on. For the price, this is a very nice mattress that sleeps very firm with a comfortable upper layer having non-breathable foam and fiber material that trap and build heat where your body makes contact with the mattress. I bought convoluted egg crate shaped gel-infused cool airflow foam topper, 100% cotton-filled highly breathable mattress pad that you can find on this planet, and 400 count 100% cool cotton sheet, to distance myself from the upper layer of this mattress - now the mattress is bearable to sleep on.  But if you naturally sleep hot, I...",1
9/21/2019,"Extremely disappointed. Bought this mattress took it out of the box untapped it and only 80% of it inflated. A large area around the foot of the mattress and side would not completely fill out and as a result there is a huge indentation. The worst part the mattress company Zinus would not stand by their satisfaction guarantee or their warranty. I then looked to Wal-Mart to correct the situation. Twice they have said they would replace the mattress I've yet to see it. the replacement seems to just sit in pending status but hasn't shipped. been like that for 3 days now. 

Save your time, money and aggravation. DO NOT BUY ZINUS MATTRESS IN A BOX.",1
3/28/2018,"Went out on a whim ordering a mattress before seeing it in person and wish I never did that. When I firstborn opened it, i let it sit for 24 hrs and it smelled so musty that it stunk up my whole room! I tried to sleep on it and the scent was still so bad that it made me sick. I let it air out two more days but it wasn't enough, the mattress still smells. It is also very firm so if you don't like a firm mattress don't get this! Not sure if it was just mine that smelled so bad but I can't sleep on it and will be returning it.",1
6/13/2022,When I first go this mattress it was great but after some time I started feeling springs and the side of the bed would sink in the middle. I even turned the bed around like they say to do every so often. The bed didn't even last two years it just became plan horrible to sleep on.,1
10/29/2018,"We needed a new mattress and this was cheap. The reviews were overwhelmingly positive. At less than 2 nights in a hotel would cost, anything seemed better than what we had.  However, we were wrong, and there reviews can't all be real. After sleeping on this mattress for 2 months, I longed for death and we both feel like we aged at least a decade.  Our new Simmons Beautyrest Black Label mattress came today and we're chalking this up to a $200 lost bet since we can't find a way to get it back to Walmart to return. Same-as-cash financing on a REAL mattress is the best decision. This is just junk. In 43 years of life, I've never woken up with back, neck, shoulder, hip, and knee pain from a mattress until sleeping on this awful thing. There were...",1
4/28/2022,"I bought this mattress for my 6 year old, he is almost 49 pounds. The bed is just ok for him, he says it's uncomfortable though. I slept on it one night and Im 5 feet 6 inches and 180 pounds. The bed was extremely uncomfortable. There is just no other way of putting it. It's no good for even one night. Put about $40 more into a different mattress, believe me.",1
10/3/2019,So my sister bought this bed with hopes it would be amazing and was highly disappointed. After sleeping on it for a while she had started complaining about her upper back hurting. She shrugged it off thinking it was from working too much. She has been out of town for a week and I have been babysitting my nephew for her. After sleeping in that bed for not even 3 days I began experiencing some discomfort in my upper back. I brushed it off at first as well thinking it was just how I sat or maybe I moved the wrong way. Well today as I was cleaning the pain began to feel sharper and that was when it occurred to me that I was also experiencing the same type of pain in the same place my sister had been complaining of. The only common factor betwee...,1
1/4/2020,If i could give it 0 stars. I would. Absoutely terrible. Not even a year in and the springs went bad. Making it concave completely on one side. Contacted zinus customer serivce. They told me i had no proof of purchase. Even when i showed my reciept. Dont buy,1
2/22/2017,"My husband and I have both been experiencing extreme back pain for the last three days we have had this king - size mattress. Now I have to pay someone to help me return it to the store today because it obviously won't fit back in the box and it won't fit in my Jeep.

 Never again. I recommend checking ratings on this product from ***low to high*** before deciding. I read only the good reviews and wish I had read the bad ones as well. I would have thought twice. It sinks and tends to clump everything to the middle area. We are not overweight so that can't be the cause. It seems comfortable until you sleep on it for a full night and wonder why your back is in so much pain next morning.",1
3/26/2019,Did not even last 6 months b4 it started dipping in... now there are practically holes in the mattress.  A few years back I bought the older version of this bed and I loved it.  I finally started to dip in so decided to get the newer version to replace it.  I regret my decision.,1
4/3/2018,"OMG THE SMELL!! I purchased this mattress as a single mother and we moved and I was on a budget! It inflated very well and is great to sleep on but it smells like mildew/mold. I let it air out, I've sprinkled baking soda (googled it) on it to help dissipate the smell but you cant even sleep on this without smelling the mold! Please do not buy this item!! & next purchase make sure it is CERTI-PUR certified without harsh chemicals and the flame retardants.",1
8/25/2018,"I ordered this mattress online because of the good reviews it had. However, it did not live up to the ratings other shoppers gave it. It expanded very well, in fact it is bigger than I expected and very heavy-hence the name Monster Mattress.  That wouldn't be so bad except it is also very FIRM and not comfortable!  I did not like it and purchased the memory foam mattress from the same company which is available in stores.",1
3/2/2018,"I purchased two of these mattresses in 2015 and was quite pleased.  HOWEVER - something has changed!  I Orders another and it arrived about a month ago.  We unpacked and let me say this mattress has an incredibly STRONG, VERY STRONG CHEMICAL SMELL THAT WILL NOT GO AWAY!!! IT IS STRONG!! It has been one month and the smell is just as intense. We have had bad reactions( itching/ stuffiness when in the room with the smell) when we are on the mattress even with a waterproof cover ( washed first) and sheets - the smell fills the entire room . What the heck is this awful chemical smell?? I have also noticed many recent reviews stating the same issues.  I'm interested to know if this is a dangerous chemical or dangerous fumes that we are breathing...",1

Itchy, rashy, cuts and scratches on myself and my children. quickly found out that fiberglass fire retardant beneath the surface permeated the mattress. Now its all over me, my possessions, and my family. Visits to the doctor, clothes and upholstery ruined, fiberglass in the washer/dryer. This mattress will ruin your lives. It's not even comfortable (besides the fiberglass). Hard as a rock. Same thing happened to queen and full mattress. Check the ingredients of your mattress and stay away from any that have FIBERGLASS. All ZINUS MATTRESSES that I have purchased have FIBERGLASS that traveled out of the mattress. You can use a dark clothing item to run across the mattress and then look at under ...",1

12/26/2018,"Terrible!!! After about 2 months it began breaking down. We've had it just over a year and we have to buy a new mattress this week. It hurts my son's back. He suffers from scoliosis and I think this mattress has made it worse. Everytime he sleeps on it, it breaks down a little more. Very disappointed.....",1
1/20/2020,"I bought this mattress about a year ago. Since day 1 it has been the hardest thing to sleep on so I bought a mattress topper to place on it and it made it somewhat salvageable. It has been about a year now and the mattress sinks in and kills my back. I onky weigh about 130, apparently this is too much weight for this mattress to handle?",1
4/5/2018,Very hard. Too firm. Limbs going numb. Hate it. Can't get it back. Can't return it. I don't own a truck to get it back to a wal Mary that's super far away. Had to buy a mattress topper. Also smelled so bad I had to put every blanket I had on it to not cough chemical smell all night. I trusted the reviews and I shouldn't have. I'm dumb. Also tired. Very tired.,1
12/4/2019,This bed is new-  I sleep alone and weigh about 110 lbs.  I do not sleep in the middle yet this mattress is sloping very badly.  I requested a refund and was told I had to deliver/return the mattress to the store- REALLY!? How on earth am I suppose to do this all by myself?  This is the most ridiculous return policy for an item that is clearly defective I have ever experienced before.  Walmart should arrange to pick up the mattress.  Very Poor item and buyer beware... Not a happy customer.,1
9/29/2017,"Beware - many of these reviews are false. They even read as such, like the writer is a member of the publicity team for the product.

 It's been a full week since this mattress arrived in the mail. It began to expand immediately out of the box, and since more than the recommended 48 hours has come and gone long ago, I assumes it has expanded as much as it's going to expand. The mattress is not square -  it's sitting  crooked, at weird angles, as though it is slightly twisted, or as though it was poorly measured and constructed. 

The even worse problem is that the chemical odor has not gone away after a full week. I have a fairly sensitive nose and stomach, and can't handle having off-gassing items in my bedroom, never mind sleep on one.

And even though this was a bad experience, it was a great outcome",1
5/18/2020,"Please notice the 1 inch out of 8 confort layer.it feels like sleeping on springs.at least after seeing these many positive reviews i can say that it didnt fit for my body and sleep style.

I woild recommend this if it had atleast 2 to 3 inch comfort layer or if you are planning to get a mattress topper.

Customer service is good but the third party they hook you for return service is worst.never seen such a pathetic customer sevice but no option apart from deal with them.",1
4/16/2019,"Worst mattress ever . You are better off buying  an air bed. I am a 25 year old female , 150 lbs.  I purchased a mattress in a box before from Sams Club and it wasn't bad . I saw the reviews for this mattress and decided to give it a try for a new apartment .

Big mistake and don't waste your time buying and popping open the box . This mattress literally leaves a dent/print wherever you sit and lay. You can feel the springs and overall it looks cheap. When I sit on the edge of the bed, my body can just slide off  . Definitely not firm or soft , just a price of fabric laying over the springs . 

This mattress may be ok for someone who is not home often, only plans to use the mattress for a limited amount of time , a little kid, or someone wh...",1

I cannot use this mattress any more.",1

I advised my husband not get this bed, and he did anyway. Now, we will be sending it back after Thanksgiving. I couldnât even last an hour on that thing.

NOT TRUE!!  It was easy to get into house and open almost immediately to full size when cut the plastic. But as far as sleeping a decent night sleep ..that is not happening!! What can you do Walmart to make me more comfortable and a satisfied Walmart shopper???  I do not have the receipt or box it came in .

8/11/2017,My husband and I bought this mattress to accommodate our tight budget. We waited past the recommended time of 72 hours for the mattress to straighten itself flat. And had to sleep on our floor so that the mattress would be perfect. I am highly disappointed as this mattress is lopsided and sinks down on my husband's side. It has been like this since waiting for the mattress to return to it's shape.  We have had this particular mattress before with no problems for about 3 years and never waited the 72 hours then. The only reason why we bought another one is because we moved and had to leave that other one behind. We would like a replacement mattress if possible. I don't think we would be able to haul this one back to Walmart because we don't ...,1

11/16/2023,"This is honestly the hardest mattress I can ever remember sleeping on. Ever! I ordered it because the plush-medium mattress in a box I also ordered from Walmart a couple of years ago (which I loved) was out of stock and I needed something ASAP-and it was all I could afford at that moment. At first it seemed alright, like something I could tolerate for a few months, but as the *month* wore on, so did the tightness of this mattress! It literally feels like we're sleeping on a board! I wake up with a sore back and side almost every day! If you are looking for a mattress that has very little give and is extremely tight, then this is for you! But, if  not...keep looking!",2
1/31/2013,"it was a strange, otherworldly experience opening this box with a mattress in it. it was more than vacume packed, was easy to open, seemed packaged well and was entertained watching it grow like one of those toy sea monkeys in a container. inner springs seems comfortable enough, though do not feel as sturdy as a standard twin mattress, works fine for my very light weight 8 year old, so for now and then next 3-5 years or so, i think it will suffice.",2
9/15/2023,"The mattress is pretty firm and it's easy to tell will only last a year due to cheap materials. The mattress comes vacuum sealed, tightly wrapped in plastic, in a box, in another box. What a waste. Anyway, both boxes and the plastic were pristine. The vacuum seal bag and mattress though have a huge gash.",2
10/21/2023,"Love the bed in a box concept, loved the sale price of $70… however it's not a good mattress. You get what you pay for. Will be using in a guest room as soon as I get a better one for myself. If I paid any more money for it I'd go through the hassle of returning it. 
Super soft, I can feel the hybrid coils, dang near sink to the bottom and I'm average sized. Way too soft and squishy in my opinion. Provides zero support.",2
3/11/2017,The mattress came vacuum sealed. Very little to no effort to unwrap it and deflate it! It sleeps nice. True queen sized.  The only con I see is that it is a little too firm for me. I've had it about 2 weeks now and some mornings it doesn't feel like I've slept on a mattress. It feels more like I slept on the floor. I would recommend this mattress to anyone who likes a firm mattress. Since its still fairly new I will wait a while to see if it softens up then I will rate higher. Its the average bang for your buck though.,2
1/20/2017,"I'm sure I put the mattress under some stress at times, but I've never owned a mattress that would sag in the middle this badly after less than 2 years.  I tend to sit on the bed while I'm doing other things and I tend to sit in the same spot... well after a year  to a year and a half,  that resulted in a sagging spot where I would sit which then would cause my back to ache.  

I tried flipping the mattress over in case that would help but it felt worse on the other side and didn't do anything about the sagging problem.  It's a decent enough mattress for the first year but starts to wear down after that.",2
1/6/2014,"Opening the mattress was a lot of fun -- it does explode and then suck in the air like some strange life form. It's decently comfortable, though not as firm as I would've liked (especially around the edges). But it has one fatal flaw: it's too small. I bought a queen, which is supposed to be 60 inches wide, but the mattress is only 58 inches wide. This might not seem like a big deal, but it means that fitted sheets sag, and the bed frame sticks out a shin-destroying inch on either side. It's really a shame because otherwise it's a pretty decent mattress, and enticingly cheap too.",2
1/7/2014,"I bought a queen for my mom, but only a few days later she started having body aches after waking up. You can even feel the springs inside the mattress. Finally, she decided to go back to the traditional pillow top mattress.

2/4/2014,"The Slumber bed appearance was great, packaging & shipping was easy, the mattress fully opened up in about 20 mins. However I would not recommend the mattress for every day use, because I can feel the mattress springs and its uncomfortable.

I am  180lbs, and it does not have much support.
If I sit on it, I sink, it smashes down, The springs are too weak.
Mattress is too soft on the sides, no edge support .
If you're looking for firmness, this product is not for you.
Invest in something better quality",2
4/14/2020,I absolutely love the Fast delivery. Mattress is true to size very big . Fit for a queen size headboard.  But the only issue is that it sinks soon as I laid down on the mattress it started to sink in .  I'm awaiting a box spring maybe that'll stop it from sinking in . But It doesn't support your back . Wouldn't recommend to someone with back problems. Other then the sinking I love it .,2

The only thing is that it is like an air mattress. When one person is on it and another sits on it, it fold in on itself, and when you get on or off it or sit on it it ""sinks"" where you are sitting. It's only comfy when your lying down and when you move it moves with you. I really wish I had spent the extra $60 and gotten the beauty rest mattress that Walmart has for $199. My daughter seems to like it but all her sheets and blankets fall off it daily and has become a hassle to make it again everyday. My advise is spend the extra $ and get a real mattress.

6/29/2016,"I purchased this mattress based on good reviews by other purchasers. I bought 2 twin mattress & they have little to no support. I weigh 141 lbs, so it shouldn't sag in the middle with my body weight. This might be ok for small children, but I would advise against it for teens or adults. Once it is opened, there is no way to get the mattress back in the box. If I could have returned it, I would have. I just can't figure out why it got good reviews & people described it as somewhat firm. It is exactly the opposite. Everyone who has tried it, has had the same opinion.",2
9/25/2014,"I saw all the reviews and even watched youtube videos reviewing this bed...
I was excited about it, it was packaged nicely and I opened it a day after it arrived.
It honestly sucks. The mattress is poor quality, it looks really nice and clean and soft
but when you lay on it the springs on the bed are kinda flimsy and you can hear them
uncoil during the night! I don't know how that happens but it does.. But what do you
expect for the price, I mean its a mattress in a box. Honestly just save your money
and invest in a better quality mattress it'll save you the back pain and disappointment.
Trust me.",2

The matress was holded in half and wrapped. Holding half means this matress is made with soft materials! I had never seen any other good matresses being hooded in half. Ever since I started to sleep on this matress I even wake up middle of nights because it is too soft and uncomfortable to roll my body and change positions. It is like air matresses. I am disappointed with this purchase and this is not how I expected.",2
4/17/2014,"I ordered five of these mattress. I think they have good quality for the value. However, I have one queen size mattress that has a compressed area making a large dent. It makes a sinking spot and is uncomfortable and very ugly. The other four mattresses expanded correctly and look good.",2
11/22/2023,It's not a bad mattress I just don't like how hard it is feels like I'm sleeping on brick every night,2
12/19/2023,Didn't get the full order still waiting on the rest of the order,2
11/22/2023,"it is not 75 inches
it is not a hybrid",2
11/2/2023,I am not happy with this mattress because it's smaller than twin,2
6/22/2021,"Don't expect long term use. After not even two years, there's a dent so bad in it that it's trash at this point. I'd probably only recommend for something temporary if you don't have much money to buy one.",2
3/26/2019,I bought this mattress based on the reviews because I was looking for something affordable and comfy but the first night we slept on it was not something I expected when I got up and stood on the other side of my room I could see our body prints that later turned into deep pockets that never went away I thought the material would rise back up with time and it would go away but it never did! its uncomfortable I stopped sleeping on it. Im currently waiting on customer service to give me a full refund.,2
8/30/2013,"My friend and I bought this kind of mattress separately. However, the quality of these two mattresses is quite different, which is very weird. Mine is quite soft while his is not. I don't know why this happens. Based on what I experienced these days, I cannot give you any information about how soft of hard this mattress is. There exists many uncertain things about this mattress. If you are lucky, you can get a good one.",2
4/1/2013,I purchased this product because the reviews was good and the price was great but when i received it and placed it on top my box spring i realized that it was way smaller than my last mattress and had me feeling like my mattress was missing. After laying on the mattress for a day i knew it was way to uncomfortable for me to keep but my husband convinced me to purchase a 3inch mattress pad for 150 dollars but it just made it worse. So i finally decided to return both and go purchase a real mattress. The product is great for the price if u are not accustomed to a thicker higher bed. Otherwise just buy a regular mattress it will save you moneyon buying a mattress pad.,2
4/8/2014,"Both Mattresses came on time, and were easy to unpack and use. Even tho they both were in open air for more than 24 hours, they both smell musty. Febreeze is not working to remove this odor.
I am going to try borax this weekend. hopefully that will do it.
they are firm and great to sleep on if you're tired enough to get past the smell.",2
10/11/2013,"I was disappointed in the firmness of this mattress. Some people may like a mattress this firm, but I feel like I'm laying on brick. I have had to purchase another softer mattress, to lay on the top of this one, to be comfortable enough to get a good nights sleep.",2
6/2/2014,"I am sorry to say, I am disappointed in this mattress. I purchased it after reading rave reviews on your website about it, I have to wonder if any of these people actually slept on this bed. I guess maybe for a spare room, or extra bed in case of company it might do in a pinch, BUT for every night use, no not so much. I waited a month after I purchased and used it, to review the bed, to make sure of how it slept. Just wish I had looked elsewhere before purchasing. A disappointment for the money I spent. Uncomfortable, and gets a indention of where I sleep after several hours. I am not a big person, a small frame woman, so was shocked when this started happening. Disappointed.",2
3/9/2014,"The mattress comes in a box and is supposed to expand to 75 inches. Ours only made it to 72, despite waiting for over a week. This is a problem with the bed we purchased bc the mattress lies on a platform and there are several inches of the platform hanging out.",2
12/30/2013,"You get what you pay for. Seeing more than thousands positive reviews, you wouldn't had doubt... usually. But as soon as I sat on it, I knew it was one of those mistakes you are NOT able to make correction easily. Obviously it'd be another mistake to return, go figure! The mattress has absolutely no support whatsoever. I felt like sinking to the bottom, and I am 5'8, weigh around 140 Ibs. There is NO density, NO reinforce, NO endurance and NO firmness... If you need support, stay away from it. Its inexpensive, but a waste of money when it wont live up to your expectations.",2
2/8/2021,I waited a week before posting a review to see how it goes.  The inner spring is not that of quality.  Is says extra firm but after a week it sags in the middle of the mattress. I'm a small build guy at 150 pounds and already showing sign of sagging. I get lower back pain because my spinal is not straight flat on my back. I'm used to extra mattress with no inner spring.  If you have lower back pain I don't recommended.,2
2/14/2014,"Not enough foam, to many coils!!!",2
9/24/2023,The mattress is not a queen mattress. Measures smaller.,2
10/19/2023,Too stiff!! Not enough padding....My Bad.,2
9/13/2023,it didn't get to the size yet in its been 72 hours,2
7/7/2023,Very hard even though it's supposed to be a medium feel.,2
7/17/2023,It wasn't a Zenus brand as it was mention,2
6/9/2023,The mattress is not firm at all. Bought thinking that it would be medium firm but it's not firm at all. Really disappointed with the purchase.,2
3/7/2023,"mattres is not firm, I would like to return it my back hurts.  The box package waslittle beat up but the plastic box has ok.",2
9/4/2013,"There is a bend in the middle part, looks ugly. No to much support for adults. Great for kids, fast delivery. But it looks bad just in the middle part. Because it comes in the box fold in half.",2
7/10/2014,"I bought this for my daughter's first ""big girl"" bed. She's 4. It's definitely fine for her - she sleeps on a mat at naptime. But for an other person, it would not be ok. I had low expectations and this mattress met them.",2
6/13/2014,it's makes too much noise everytime you move . i would never buy this mattress or any other one from this website / off line period ! i just got this mattress in May 2014 !!,2
4/19/2020,"In less about 2.5 years of fine use by a couple, the mattress started to shape funny. I'm not sure why but I think the inside coils started to dislocate!",2
4/6/2013,"The mattress is much too soft for my back. I bought if for our vacation home and it is ok to sleep on for a few days, but I would not be able to sleep on it all the time.",2
7/18/2013,"In other words, it is cheap. To be honest, I will keep it since I don't want to go through the hassle of returning it and getting another mattress. However, I don't think I can keep this for too long.",2
12/28/2013,"I thought the mattress would be more comfortable after the first three days of expansion, but for me, it was still uncomfortable. The mattress will do for one or two days of sleep, but I would not recommend it for long term use.",2
9/3/2013,"I ordered this for my son based on the reviews, but it doesn't feel like there is any foam in it at all and I can feel each and every spring or coil!! I will have to purchace some kind of topper for him so it will be more comfortable..",2
7/31/2020,"I've been searching for a firm mattress for a long time. When i saw all these positive reviews about this mattress, i thought my search had ended. Unfortunately, I'm very disappointed. It says extra firm, but when i lay on it, it feels soft, not firm at all :( 

If you are not looking for soft mattress, this would be a good choice with a reasonable price.",2
7/29/2016,"I was very happy with this new mattress.  I only wish it were a bit more ""firm"". 

 It's a bit pillowy.  It sinks a bit more than I like but I also bought a gel-foam mattress cover and it helped.  Still NOT firm but I find myself sleeping- in a bit more than I use to!  Very comfortable!",2
2/28/2023,Bought this because of the reviews. They must be paid for good reviews or something because this mattress is not comfy. Me and my husband cannot get comforts and toss and turn all night and wake up in pain. Hoping a mattress topper will make it tolerable. It is affordable but unless you like a very firm bed do not buy this. No where did I read it was firm. Shipping was fast.,2
9/15/2014,"The only reason I gave two stars is because the mattress is actually comfortable. Don't expect to receive a standard size mattress, because it is very thin in height. I ordered this bed in queen with a frame. It didn't fit in width and was too low in height. The springs serve no purpose because if you don't get a platform bed that has some sort of riser system your bed will sit too low. You still have to purchase a box spring with this bed and based on others reviews and the item description it suggests otherwise don't listen!",2
5/6/2021,"Mattress is fine - not super comfy, but not terrible either. The delivery part was a nightmare. Was given a window of 10am - 9pm - took off work and waited all day. Whenever you call onTrac they just tell you they deliver up to 9pm - super helpful. They never showed and I was told there was a delay. Took off work the next day to wait and again the window was 9am to 9pm. They arrived at 8:50pm. So, saddle up for a long day of waiting for your mediocre mattress.",2
12/4/2013,"This mattress looks nothing like the picture, it's smaller and very uneven looking. It come wrapped in tapes in a small box, and it's really heavy for the size of it.

As far as comfort goes, it's ok, if you are looking for something part time, this should fit the bill.",2
11/23/2020,"I don't know if the fault lies with Walmart or the shipping company.
I really like the mattress but the shipping was nothing more than horrible. The shipping box was not just damaged but destroyed. The mattress itself was left on our apartment parking lot(not even close to the door). I had to pickup the mattress(the outer packaging box was already a lost cause) and stumble my way across the building. 
The mattress was good though. There was a tiny tear due to the way that it shipped, other than that I have no real complaints about the mattress. I wish I had taken some pictures of that experience.
I still have nightmares about my purchases being destroyed while shipping.",2
10/24/2022,"They increased the price significantly, so now I have to change my review. for a $60 mattress I thought it was pretty good quality,  considering most people are buying it for a young child. but now the amount they are asking for it doesn't fit what you're actually getting. I was going to order another for my youngest child but now im choosing another option to get a better quality mattress for the same price.",2
4/9/2018,"At first, I thought this was a decent mattress but it is not the most comfortable. You can feel the springs through the mattress and it overall feels pretty cheap. Wish I would have spent a little bit more for a better option. 
I would not repurchase nor recommend.",2
5/6/2020,I do not like this mattress. It is just too hard for me. My fiance likes it though. My back hurts more now than ever. But it is what it is. Also there is an odor to the mattress. I read that it might but this smells almost like mildew or mold. Since we have had this I wake up congested so I do not recommend this bed unless you like firm and you can handle the smell.,2
1/13/2022,"I'll try to keep this Short.
We ordered the twin size to replace an older thinner mattress...... we received a twin.... but it's about 5 inches Shorter in length than the old one lol. It's like a hobbit sized mattress. The mattress is soft though so I guess that's a plus. Material to make it full length must have been in Short supply. Its on a growing kids bed so we will probably have to replace it again Shortly. Its a good thing I don't have a Short temper or this review would be Short on puns. This concludes my Short review, thanks for reading.",2
4/9/2014,"When I got this mattress on that small box and it expanded to become the mattress I got real exited! I mean not only almost everybody gives the mattress a 5 star, but you also get it in a cool way. I was ready to have the best sleep I had in years....
Unfortunately, it was not like that. The mattress is too hard and it doesn't feel completely leveled. The corners are not completely straight either which makes it look a little weird. It really stinks because when I first laid on it felt pretty comfortable.
If you still want to try this mattress try the one with the pillow top. It has the same kind of rating. Although I haven't tried that one, I believe this one needs more cushions between you and the coils. Therefore, the pillow top might fe...",2
10/6/2014,I received the mattress few days ago and let it sit for 48 hrs. Once I started using the mattress was great but now I am starting to feel the springs move which also makes noise when it moves. I'm worried the mattress will break soon since I hear and feel the springs and only had it less than a week.. :(,2
9/25/2014,This mattress is very uncomfortable and hard on your whole body. I wish now that I would of went to a mattress place and got one. It Is not something I would tell anyone to buy . It lay very wield even after leaving it the 48hrs. it says to let it get its shape and fullness. Never did any of it.,2
1/7/2014,and lumpy,2
2/24/2014,Very uncomfortable..the odor of the mattress is awful. I can understand from packaging but it has me sick..,2
2/23/2013,I thought it would be more comfortable but I can feel every spring... I wouldn't recommend this to anyone!!,2
3/10/2014,"Does not seem like it is going to hold up. Should work out for the occasional user in a guestroom, however, I would not buy if I had seen in a store.",2
8/15/2016,"The mattress is way too firm, tried it one night and could not sleep, went back to my old mattress the next night. Would have nice if the web site said if it was firm or soft.",2
4/30/2020,"Bed is not firm as it states ,kind of wished I would have waited to by a bed.Not bad for price but its not for me,I wake up tired and sore.It's ok for guests.Guess the saying""You get what you pay for"" holds true",2
9/10/2016,This is a nice mattress.  It takes only about 5 minutes to unpack and it expanded immediately.  The only bad thing is it's it's VERY firm.  I'd return it but it would be impossible to get it back into the box.,2
7/14/2016,"It doesn't support very well my weight, and I am 64lb... I can't even imagine sleeping with somebody, but it does the job... is also very heavy, took me some time to put it in the frame",2
2/10/2023,Have had this for about a month and it just almost hurts to Lay on especially as a side sleeper. I am looking into getting a thick topper to try and help. But I guess you get what you pay for,2
9/13/2014,"I wouldn't recommend it to a friend or someone else, for that money you can buy something used in craigslist and still have some money left. It look the mattress would last for a lot because it very thin and soft and one wrong move can finish it.",2
3/9/2017,"I ordered this very early in the morning because of the 2 day shipping, but it took 4 days before it got here, so company had to sleep in the floor. But as for the product it was super easy to open and filled up fast and feels comfortable",2
5/6/2021,I would say this bed is more firm then comfy. I have actually felt a cheap hotel bed that slept better than this. I bought it for my kids that can sleep on almost anything so they dont seem to mind.,2
9/6/2016,The bed is hard with  very little padding. I want to return it but it pops out of the box I don't know how to return it other then bringing the mattress to walmart. The concept is good it's just too hard. You can feel the springs.,2
12/15/2021,I will have to return this (which is also so tough due to multiple back and forth conversations with customer care) because it's causing back pain to me. Doesn't seem to suit an adult. I would recommend to try before you buy.,2
5/26/2021,Purchased for the spare bedroom so I expected a cheap mattress. That's exactly what this is. I literally can feel every spring in it. I wish I would have spent a little more for better quality.,2
1/18/2017,I unrolled it and waited the suggested 48 hours. I put an egg crate on this mattress and even still it does not feel firm. The packaging was so cool. The feel of this mattress meh not so much.,2
8/6/2020,"Before I purchased this mattress, I read a lot of reviews . To my surprise, it is not extra firm as I thought.  It is too soft for me to lay down, so I rather prefer sleeping on the floor.",2
1/15/2022,i dislike the stiffness of the mattress due to the springs. the best nights on the mattress was the first five days after that the springs become very noticeable and painful,2
5/9/2020,"I ordered this mattress for the guestroom box. Well it was delivered looked fine no damage to it, that would concern me! However when I opened it up and got it all out of the plastic I had noticed several stains on the mattress",2
5/21/2014,"I purchased this bed in the full size for my 3 year old toddler and wasn't expecting the best, I mean as low of a price how could I, but I figured it would be perfect as a starter big girl bed for her but not so much.

The shipping was quick. The bed expanded to over 8"" which I had read happening in the reviews so I was happy about that. There wasn't any odor to the bed at all, but maybe that was because we opened it right away and let it expand and air out for 2 full days. I really wanted to like this bed but it wasn't very comfortable for any of us to lay on. We had to put up a side rail for so our toddler would not fall out and that side of the bed leaned toward the rail so when you would lay down on that side of the bed you instantly ro...",2
12/24/2011,"I bought this mattress based on all the good reviews I read. The site to store option was very convenient which is the main reason I bought it. However, the mattress itself is thinner than 8"" and is too firm. I have it situated on a platform bed I also bought at walmart and the two together make sleeping a crummy experience. My back is a mess now. I'm going to try to buy a feather top for it to see if that'll help, but this bed is not worth the money in any way. And it didn't save me money either since I now have to buy a feather mattress topper.
Take it from me, test a mattress in person first before buying. Online is not the way to go, even if it does seem more convenient and cost-efficient. It's not.",2
3/28/2017,"Any one that needs a firm to med. firm mattress due to back issues , this is not the bed for you. Even though it is listed as firm. It is not. It is more of a medium. I am quit disappointed . My arms were going numb and could not  hardly move when I woke up the first night sleeping in it. Due to the lack of firmness. I will give it one more try by putting a board under the mattress. Then its back to the store .",2
6/25/2014,"I did a lot of searcher before I bought this mattress due to the feedback from others. When I opened it , it looks nice ,but when I sit on the mattress , it go down very deep , by the way I am only 100 pounds. It really too soft for me.
If Walmart do the free return , I would like to return it .
I don't know how long it is going to last. Just feel sad get this mattress",2
3/24/2014,"I brought this mattress hoping it would allow me a better nights sleep. So fat I haven't been able to sleep through the night yet. Just as I'm writing this, i have severe back pain from the night before. This mattress is not comfortable to me. I'm considering returning it.",2
1/13/2012,I bought this mattress solely based on the good reviews. I was totally wrong. Now I had doubts about the reviews being genuine or paid reviews. It came in a box which was handy. It inflated into the shape easily after opening the package. The quality of the mattress was sub-par. There was no edge support at all. The springs are way too weak. I believe they are made of thinnest possible gauge wire. When I sat on it I could feel the springs had not necessary support. Also strong chemical smell lingered many days. It may have been from manufacturing process. Overall I would not recommend this product anyone.,2
2/15/2012,"I've only had this mattress for a couple of months and the middle is already starting to sag. I'm disappointed with this product. Also, for those who need a firm mattress, this is not it. It is more a soft-medium than firm. I was hoping for firmer than this.",2
1/26/2023,Mattress was good.  However Walmart service not so good.  I entered the wrong payment info at checkout and immediately cancelled my order.  Then I placed a 2nd order with the correct payment info.  Walmart decided to charge me for both orders and ship them both out.  Now it's taking me weeks to get my refund and also having to take tie off work to coordinate with the freight company sent to pick up my item which takes them days to pick up.  Not very happy with how I have to be inconvenienced due to their mishap.  Not a good move Walmart.,2
5/3/2016,"I decided to give this brand a shot because it was a lower price than another ""mattress in a box"" that I previously had (and very comfortable). I figured thousands of 5-star reviews would give me a good idea and help my decision in getting this one.

Once I received the mattress and set it up, I thought it was just ""ok"". Not as comfy as my previous one, but seemed like it'd do the job. I just was never comfortable in it. It wasn't as supportive as I expected. And the edges started getting crushed downward probably after about 6 months. I'm only 170 lbs. Once in a while I'll feel a spring go ""clunk"". Not sure what that really is, though.

I'll go an try another brand after I get rid of this one. Sorry, but I don't recommend this to anyone.",2
7/27/2016,"Mattress is pretty good at first, then it begins to sag where you sleep.  Turned mattress to keep it from getting to saggy; edges are not strong.  Coils move or pop or something after awhile.  Good for a short term mattress, not good for a long term mattress.",2
8/10/2016,"The mattress is not comfortable. They list as firm, this is not a firm mattress. It has no padding, you can see the impression of the coil springs. These mattresses come rolled up, and kept compressed for an extended amount of time. I guest that is why they don't expand to there full description as advertised. All I can say,They are a good price, and can be used for the purpose intended. A place to lay down.",2
2/26/2012,The shipping was very fast got this the next day after ordering.My only complaint is it is really firm so if you like a softer sleep this is not for you. I am keeping it and getting a topper to put on it to make it softer. set up was very easy. it is heavy so if it is going up stairs you will need help unless you are a male then you should have no problems. just un wrap it and it pretty much does it all its self.,2
6/27/2013,I only purchased this mattress because the ratings were so great. I would not pay $20 for this mattress. Very cheep you can feel every coil/spring in it and it is permanently curled due to it being shipped in a box. You can return to any Wal-Mart and no need to ship back and I highly recommend this option as this is what I just did. Never again will I purchase a mattress online with out seeing it in person. This mattress is better left in the box and never to be slept on.,2
9/4/2013,"This was literally a matress vacuum sealed to fit in a box that could be carried (about 2 feet long and 6 in wide). We didn""t even bother opening it. We thought it was a matress with a box (like a box in it for support). Ended up going to a matress store and getting a mattress and a box spring for almost the same price (was about $40 more)",2
12/17/2013,"This mattress was an easy choice because of all of the good reviews and the low price. Added to the fact that I live on the 2nd floor of an apartment building and needed to be able to carry it upstairs by myself, this mattress seemed like a dream come true. All that to say, I now have chronic back issues due to this mattress. It is not comfortable enough for daily use. If you were to use this in a guest room or for your dog to sleep on, it would be great. But for regular people, go with something else. I can feel the coils in the mattress poking me in the back at night, and I've only been using it for a year and there are indentations in the mattress in the spots that I usually sleep in. My neck hurts, my back hurts, and I can barely sleep ...",2
5/27/2016,"if you like cheap beds than you've hit the jackpot. I would say this is a better version of cheaper beds. If all you want is something to sleep on, than this is it. From a side sleepers perspective, it is extremely firm and the comfort foam does nothing but keep the coils from making a circle impression on my arms. My spouse which is a back sleeper also says it is extremely firm but does not feel the coils.  If you have a few yoga mats, stack them up and you'll get the replica feeling of this bed if you want to try it. Don't forget to throw a couple of hooped earrings on the yoga mats and cover it with a thin cotton comforter.",2
1/7/2016,"This was a nice mattress in the beginning,but after several months it became ""lumpy""
and my back problems started up again.
I think it would be great for a guest room ,when it is used a little at a time,but
overall,everyday use,its comfort levels deteriorate after a short period.
Time to find a new mattress.",2
9/4/2013,The bed was too big for the space. It was completely unpacked and assembled before I realized it. It fit but allowed no room to move around. I was immediately sorry that we had unpacked it because it was impossible to put everything back into the boxes to ship it back.,2
9/16/2013,This mattress is way too soft. Stay away from it if you want firm support.,2
8/14/2013,"It said 3"" memory foam..
Looks more like 1""
I can definitely feel the springy things..",2
9/16/2013,Mattress is too squishy and is undersized by 2 inches in length and 1 inch in width.,2
2/27/2023,Is this bed on prop 65 list to cause cancer or didn't make the list yet not that comfortable and has springs worth the price.,2
9/3/2016,THE MATTRESS IS VERY HARD TO SLEEP ON. I HAD TO BUY EXTRA PADDING AND PLUSH MATTRESS COVER TO HELP MAKE IT SOFTER.,2
8/3/2016,When I purchased this I thought it was a mattress and a box spring.   i then needed to purchase something to go underneath it  to support it.,2
7/10/2016,"The Walmart description does not mention memory foam padding, which I did not want. The mattress is softer than firm.",2

11/28/2015,"This mattress was comfortable for a few months. We have not had it a year and I do not sleep well on it at all. It even looks as if it has shrunk as well. This would be great in a guest room for a temporary visit, but not for long term use.",2
4/7/2020,It's not great but was all I could afford.,2
7/5/2020,The mattress lost its firmness after 30 days - I was very disappointed,2

7/11/2014,"This has been my second experience buying a mattress online. Repeat after me: Never, ever buy a mattress you can't try out. Please note that the basis of the review is not reflective of the quality of the mattress, which is very good. My discontent is that it is much firmer than I would have liked, and I do not sleep well on it. As many say with bad relationships, 'It's not you, it's me.'",2
1/9/2015,i got this bed my past bed was all the way gone. . the time it took to get to my house was good. rectangular box wt. bout 70 pds i cut it open and sliced the bag that wrap around the bed . It started to inflate and became more bigger. first 2 nights slept good. but after a few days it sag a little. i put some cushion under the mattress and it seems to sleep better. paying 200$ for a queen size mattress this is what you going to get if it comes in a box. if you weigh under 175pds then this mattress may work. it is not firm at all real soft. if soft what you looking for and you dont have back problems then this could work for your budget. if you over 200 pds and have back issues save your money and go to a mattress store and lay on the mattre...,2

5/27/2014,"I didn't like what I saw, never took it out of the box and just returned it. Great that WalMart will let us do that. Thanks",2
6/6/2015,you have to tell the buyer they need a very good spring bod and some toppers and this make it more expenscis so you can buy this in the first place. Sorry,2
1/15/2020,"so after reading a ton of reviews on this i thought it was time i upgraded my mattress. package came as pictured, opened up the bed correctly and let expand for around 9-10 hours. later that night me",2

This mattress cannot be turned as it has only one side.",2
2/27/2016,When I first reviewed it I was spetical and nervous but I didn't want to spend much at the moment so I bought it. I received and the two nights I slept awesome and then each night got worse. It's been two weeks now and my back and neck hurts and it seems like I always end up in the middle of the mattress. #yougetwhatyoupayfor,2
9/1/2017,"The mattress has been aired out for 24 hours, but it still smells funky. Weird chemical smell lingers in the room. Fabric refresher didn't work.

1/2/2015,"Using from: 1 month.

What I liked:
Walmart delivery. Mattress is a good quality. Material is good. No smell at all. Good to use within 10 minutes of unboxing.

What I didn't like:
It's not firm. I wake up with sore back or shoulders; so as my spouse.
If you are looking for just any mattress, this one is value for money.
If you are looking for firm mattress with good comforts, this is not for you.",2
8/1/2017,"This twin mattress doesnt fit fully on the twin bed (bought on walmart) and leaves bit of room either at the top or bottom. So when someone sits the mattress goes down taking you down. The mattress specs indicates 75"" while bed indicated 74.5 yet after placing mattress it left 1"" room causing it to go down when someone puts weight at the end where the gap is.",2
5/2/2015,I would use this is for kids only under the age of 10 because of the support issues....if someone is too heavy you can feel the base support under it and is not comfortable. We even tried it o a carpeted floor and it still was too squishy...but it did come out of the box and fluff up correctly.,2
9/10/2017,This mattress is way too firm for me. I don't know how other people are saying it's so comfortable. Nothing about the mattress I have is comfortable. I had a friend try it and they got up and slept on the couch instead. I guess I'll have to get a mattress pad.,2

12/5/2022,"We bought this for our 4yr old who has been using a 20 yr old pillowtop mattress. I didnt realize after purchasing and receiving this mattress that it was a tighttop. I would have preferred another pillowtop. While sitting on this mattress, you pretty much roll off the edge of it and you can feel the coils through the sides of the mattress. It doesnt have much padding/layering at all. My 4yr old probably cant tell a difference but I would have kept our old one if I had known it would be this low of quality.",2
6/7/2019,"I like medium-firm mattresses, but thereâs something about this one that I just canât sleep right. Itâs like sleeping on a plank: not necessarily hard, just super flat. I canât sleep for more than a few hours at a time (normally Iâm a very deep sleeper) and I constantly wake up with back and neck pain. I even bought a 3-inch gel mattress top from Walmart which has worked perfectly for other hard mattresses in the past, but it doesnât make a difference on this one. It comes in a box which is very convenient (the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 0), and itâs not even that uncomfortable if youâre just lying on it, but itâs impossible to get a good night sleep on. Like I said, I wake up every few hours nowadays when I ...",2
9/15/2017,"If you just need a throwaway mattress to keep around, or you're just a simple guy living cheap, I guess this will do. Even then you'll probably want to put a board between it and the box spring or base, because it's just a floppy, saggy mattress. 

It raised up to size really quickly. I didn't use it for about 60 hours after taking it out, and when I measured it then, it was 8 inches high. I didn't measure it during the 60 hours, but it seemed like it reached full height as soon as I took it out. Maybe it got to 6 inches right away and then slowly got to 8. All I know is that the visual inflation stopped within minutes, and by 60 hours, it was at 8.

But as soon as I picked it up to carry it to the other room, I knew it was a pretty bad mat...",2

10/24/2019,"I bought a queen sized mattress at my local walmart and threw away the receipt before realizing how uncomfortable this thing is. It's been over a month and I wake up every morning stiff and in pain, if you have any sort of back problems my suggestion is to skip this buy so you dont end up like me in pain every morning.  Price was good just wish it would work for me better.",2
11/25/2018,"Considering you are buying a mattress that has the ability to be stuffed in a box should say something. We've not had our mattress a year and it is already so broken down that I cannot sleep on it anymore without having to have help to get up and going through a crazy amount of pain for at least 45 minutes before my first cup of coffee. With that said, if you don't have anything and someone gifts you this mattress, be grateful and appreciative because it is better than the cold, hard ground. If you have options, RUN!!!THIS IS NO A GOOD CHOICE.",2
1/28/2017,The quality is poor. The only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the cheap price. the sides of this mattress are a thin material with no backing or padding; you can literally wrap your finger around the springs inside it. Every time i move on the mattress the metal springs squeak. I cannot imagine this mattress lasting more than 6 months :(,2
6/12/2020,"Just a very soft mattress.  Not what I was expecting.  From Walmart, they do an amazing job  with any transaction you make,  making sure you are happy with your purchase,  so I did returned it to get my refund,  but it was very disappointing.   I guess this brand is not as good as other ones they have on their showroom.     Bottom line, do not get!",2
5/6/2020,"INSPECT YOUR BOX!! I was so excited when this item was delivered. I opened the box to reveal my beautiful new mattress and out crawled a HUGE ROACH! I took the box outside to take the mattress out fully to inspect and inside the plastic(INSIDE!) was another crushed roach. After sanitizing the entire mattress and cleaning it a few times and making sure there was no sign of bug life, it is finally in my room. Mattress is great! Inspect your box and mattress before putting it in your house.",2
11/17/2019,"I bought this for my son, it's a decent bed for the price, he's had it for over a year now. The biggest issue with it is it's ONLY for sleeping on, he plays video games in his room, instead of using his gaming chairs or futon he sits at the corner of the bed and there is a large pothole where he sits, we turned the mattress and now he has another.  I don't understand why!? The mattress he had before from the mattress store cost the same price and lasted 17 years with no dipping, we only replaced it because he outgrew a twin. I have to buy him another mattress and wont be cutting corners, I'll be going to the mattress store.",2
10/24/2019,I purchased this mattress about 2.5 years ago. It was a really great mattress up until about 6 months ago. It started to be really lumpy and uncomfortable. Backaches every morning. I woke up last weekend and there was suddenly a huge gap in the mattress. Almost like it had caved in. A mattress should last longer than 2-2.5 years,2
5/21/2018,I had purchase this spring mattress and when it arrived it was a little heavy vers my memory foam i purchase a couple of years ago. Once I set it up and allow it to settle it was not as comfortable as i thought it would be. I feels Like a regular mattress that you get from the store. I wouldn't recomind someone to buy for everyday use only for guest room or ect. It was very disappointing thinking it would be very comfortable from reading the reviews but boy was i wrong. Do not feel like the hassle of trying to get it back in the box and back to UPS so i will just have to settle with it.,2
6/27/2019,Bought for my 10 year old son to replace an old mattress but he felt it was too uncomfortable to the point we had to purchase another.  I've been sleeping on it and couldn't agree more. The first week my back hurt every day after I woke up. I'm guessing we just need a softer mattress as this one doesn't work for us. Hoped for better seeing the reviews.,2
11/24/2014,"ordered 2 mattresses for my children's bunk bed.1 Spa Sensations 8"" Memory Foam mattress and 1 Slumber 1 - 8'' Mattress-In-a-Box. have to say that the memory foam mattress is a much more sturdy than the coil spring mattress in a box. its very weak on the edges when you roll your body near the side. I plan on returning the 1 Slumber 1 - 8'' Mattress-In-a-Box, and purchasing another Spa Sensations 8"" Memory Foam mattress.",2
4/6/2015,"I bought this mattress only because the price was right and I only need it for a short period of time. Rather than spend over 400 for a new set, i use this mattress on a boxspring I purchased last year. I dont believe this mattress will last for more than 2 years, as there is no edge support and after about a month, the mattress seems to be sagging. I plan to rotate it and get as much life out of it as is possible. If youre looking for a mattress that will last for the recommended life of 8 years for a mattress, this is not the one to buy.",2
10/11/2019,"At first it was very cool to see a bed grow from a box. but I would never buy this bed again. I've had it for a year now and I've got back pain that has pushed me to buy numerous memory foam pillows and it's barely helping. Additionally, the corners of the bed are very week and you will slide right off of you try sitting on the edge. My advice is to NOT buy a spring mattress in a box, or at least prepare to get a mattress topper.",2
1/6/2020,"I waited 1.5 years to write this review so I could share how the mattress held up long-term. When I first got the mattress, it felt awesome! It was very comfortable and had just the right amount of firmness. At this point though, I can feel where almost every spring is. Whatever the padding is that surrounds the springs seems to have slowly separated into clumpy bits - which I believe is why I can feel the springs. It's really been hurting my back and has lost a good amount of its firmness. I've only kept with it for the past few months because I needed to save up money to get a better bed. 
Anyway, for something short term this works just fine. Don't expect that comfort to last too long though!",2
6/24/2020,Was supposed to be extra firm but not even medium in fitness. Can't use it. Can't return it as the instructions required 48hrs to allow complete reinflation and the box was tossed out before that 48hrs was over.  Now I have this soft bed taking up space,2

I was so excited to get it and the 2 Days we waited for it to reach full size were filled with great anticipation. My husband was skeptical and I had full faith hat it would meet my expectations. Well, sad to say my husband was right and it's super uncomfortable. It's hard and my back hurts all night sleeping on this mattress. I wake up multiple times per night and am so disappointed. My 3 year old won't sleep on it because she says it's

9/19/2017,It feels like a blow mattress that you have to pump air in.  You will need extra cushion for this type of mattress in a box.  A really nice mattress pad would help it out greatly.,2

4/21/2022,This one definitely missed the mark. Waaaay too soft; the kind of soft where you sink straight through the mattress as though there's no support at all. Would not buy again; would've returned if I'd kept the box.,2
1/23/2022,Poor quality construction.  Springs started breaking after 2 years.  Getting mattress replaced is a joke.  Still waiting for a replacement 3 months after proving it was broken,2
4/11/2016,I'm glad this was for the wife. She likes it but in my opinion it is to soft. I sat on it and there is no support what so ever. I would not recommend this to anybody...,2

8/12/2015,After reading the reviews I really though I was getting a bargain....this mattress literally folds in half while you're holding it & is super flimsy. There is no way this could be used without a box spring. I'm not quite sure it's even a real king size because it doesn't fit completely in the bed frame. Really disappointed with this purchase :-(,2
12/29/2016,"The price of this mattress was a great deal for us. I bought this mattress for my son last year, he has a bad habit of jumping and flopping on his bed which caused the middle of the mattress to sink in drastically. The springs in the mattress were not strong enough to hold up to a 46 lbs child after 5 months. I would assume an adult who is a sound sleeper would have no problems with this mattress and could possibly even last them years. Bouncy children though would be out of the question.",2
2/26/2015,"To be fair, i never opened the medium sized box that held the mattress. I returned it to the store. I knew i needed something more substantial. I was expecting a traditional coiled spring mattress. This may be perfect for a guest room but not for your main sleeping mattress.",2
9/7/2015,"Some of the holes that were pre-drilled were placed wrong. By the time we realized it, it was too late too late to start over. We had to get our own 2x4's to reinforce it. Also, I thought I was buying a normal twin size mattress to fit the bed. The mattress is a lil small and now you can see some of the unfinished wood. It's very unpleasant to look at.",2
3/9/2012,"Much smaller than a full size mattress. Too much of a hassle to return so we built a platform to keep the mattress from falling through the bed frame (only because we had left over building supplies from a remodel) and we have to use flat sheets instead of fitted so the sheet will stay because the fitted is WAY too big. Daughter likes it so it will do for now. I have to say it is a comfortable mattress, just wish it was the right size. If you want a full maybe order a queen instead?",2
7/12/2015,"this was my quick and very recent purchase for my mother (who is about 4'10"" and 180#'s) but in my opinion mattress is too soft , maybe okay for a kid or more likely for an overnight guest, definitely not for an adult to use every day (which was my intention). So, my prediction is that it will be short lived (hopefully a year) and if that will turn out wrong - I will write about it.... In conclusion, the very best way to sleep to avoid any spine problems such as scoliosis for example, is on the floor....but obviously many will disagree (including me) for various reasons :)",2
7/17/2015,The picture is deceptive . It appears to be a box spring mattress combo it is not .

2/26/2015,I got this so I wouldnt need purchase a large mattress for my platform bed. It isn't as thick as it looks in the photo. I guess that is why it is shown at an angle. It is averagely comfortable but I think overly priced.,2

9/10/2014,I thought i was getting a good deal i orderd a queen size on roll back for 169.00 on the 5th. it came monday i was excited looking at the mattress it noticed it was a bit small for a queen i measured it. it was a full size sent in a queen box im not happy....i want the right size sent to me or my money back and you can not get it back in the box.. and i dont have a truck... very unhappy looking at the box that is in pieces it says 101lbs and my orders form says 71lbs,3
12/22/2023,Its not really what I was expecting. You can definitely feel the springs a whole lot more than I thought given its a hybrid. I was hoping to not feel the metal when laying on it. The kids wont mind it as much but just know you can definitely feel the springs and top is not soft like you would expect.,3
12/1/2023,"I don't undersrand the five-star reviews. You can literally feel the springs while laying on this mattress.

I did buy this for my 7-year-old son. He probably doesn't notice the springs like I do, because he is still so small, but I want it to last a while. It should be much better once I get a good mattress topper. 

I guess you get what you pay for, but I paid very similar for his twin-size bed that's now on his top bunk and it is lightyears better.

My final thoughts for anyone reading this review is just to be prepared to buy a mattress topper. The support is there from the pocket springs, but it lacks much needed cushion.

I guess you",3
5/5/2020,"Giving this 3 stars because I didn't get to try it. Mattress arrived damaged. Box was tore up. Mattress had been smashed so badly that the packaging was ripped off, the mattress material torn and a spring was exposed.",3
3/31/2021,Arrived late and package was broken into.,3
8/9/2021,The mattress is good but it goes with a bug on it,3
4/30/2016,"I ordered this mattress for myself, it was very uncomfortable for me. I would wake up with back pain and couldn't sleep. I gave it to my 20 year old son and he loves it, he said it the best mattress he has ever had. I just thought is was probably to firm for me. I guess it's an alright mattress for people who like a firm mattress",3
10/22/2023,I let this mattress air for 72 hours as recommended it did expand to full capacity however the outer ridge of the bed is very hard the mattress itself is decent for the price I did however end up buying a mattress pad it absolutely fixed the problem the problem with this mattress is the coil system,3
6/25/2013,"We bought this mattress as a replacement for a nice queen set that was old and causing my back to hurt. We didn't want to pay for a whole new set and hoped that just getting a new mattress would be enough. This mattress is a good value but after a few weeks we realized it's just not firm enough for us. We're returning it and getting something else but for a simple, cheap mattress it's fine and would be great for kids or guest rooms. I wish I would have bought a few of these for our kids bunk beds instead of the ones we have. Some reviews mentioned that it ""collapses"" when you sit on the sides but we didn't find this to be a problem. If you're looking for a high quality mattress just spend the extra money for something else but if you just n...",3
7/26/2016,"The quality seems very good and it is very comfortable, on the firm side.  We have it in our guest bedroom so it will not get a lot of use so I expect it to serve us for a few years.  Even if it only lasted a year you would be money ahead just to buy one of these every year than pay $1,500+",3
3/30/2011,"When I first got my mattress in a box, I thought there was no way a gueen size mattress was in that small of a box, but sure enough there was. They had sucked all the air out, so it looked small in the box , but it quickly fluffed up, and out, to a full size queen mattress. I have slept on it for a week now, and It doesn't sleep as well as I had hoped. One thing is, when you set on the side of the mattress it smashes down to about one inch. I did messure it, with nothing on it but sheets, and it does messure 8 full inches. When laying on it, it is very noisey, and goes flat under my weight. I am a 250lb person sleeping in it. I guess I could get use to it. Not sure yet, if I'm gonna replace it with a thicker more sturdy mattress, or not. It...",3
5/13/2020,"Decent enough for the price. It's soft and comfortable, but the really frustrating part is that all four corners collapse if you sit on the corners of the bed. This happens to both mattresses that I bought so not just a fluke. Definitely don't recommend for a large adult, but works for young kids.",3
3/21/2017,"It's firm enough, but not sure it's a long term solution for an adult. Handles would be nice, but it doesn't have them. It's a bed in a box, so don't expect too much. For what it is, I think it's much better than others in its category.  Measurements are pretty accurate, but there is a slight curve and indent on one part. Again, it's a bed in a box, so I wasn't expecting perfection. I use a memory foam topper, also, and that adds to the bed's comfort.",3
11/7/2023,"I got this mattress at $62, I expected 8” and supportive.  It's more like 5” and light duty, you can feel the coils individually. I had to buy topper to make it more comfortable.  Good thing it's for a light 8 year old.",3
12/26/2023,"I wanted a very firm mattress, and this seems closer to that but not the one I was looking for. But for the price I think it's not a bad deal either. I may not use for a longer period.",3
10/29/2023,I love the matters but not the delivery because it was supposed to arrive yesterday. I had to be in a very important matter. I saved things in the cart to buy but now I'm not sure if I should order.,3
12/4/2023,"loved the packaging made it easy to move. once opened, it was not as soft as I had expected. still good, holds up to my 150lb dog jumping up on it! great for the price.",3
10/31/2023,i don't like the Walmart support for this order particularly.. i was raising a concern about the package and delivery. they are responding properly. the mattress of one side is getting down fully,3
9/25/2014,"If you're looking firmness, this product is not for you. It does the job for the price but after using it I would rather spend a few more dollars on a memory foam. In the center is a good mattress, but the banks have no support.",3
9/12/2023,"The bed was easy to put together and the quality of the fabric is good, however one of the rails (F) to support the mattress was not the correct size it was too short.",3
8/6/2016,"I'm a soft to medium mattress person, so i made a mistake when i bought thia one, but i tried and yes too firm for me. I just retuned it yesterday and waiting for my money",3
8/29/2023,Its okay not really comfortable the metal in the bed really sticks out meaning you can feel the metal so thats the uncomfortable part i would recommend a matress with no metal in it,3
10/13/2023,first off my kids dont mind it to much but i can feel the springs in it and not very soft and the top of it not much thickness from springes it a good temp mattress  till you can afford a bettwr one balling on budget here so for now it have to do,3
9/27/2023,Mattress is pretty hard snd lumpy unfortunately. It'll do for now for a 14 yo but i wouldn't use it if it was for an adult who needed to work in the mornings.,3
9/4/2023,"It's not a very bad mattress, but I believe it has poor quality. You can feel the springs by touching the fabric! It could have been better. I also had backaches.",3
3/23/2023,"This item has changed. I bought three of these mattresses last year for my children, they were extremely comfortable and I was extremely impressed! Fast forward to this year and I buy a fourth child of mine this mattress and it's different. The top isnt like a pillow top type anymore like the other ones were, its not as comfy, its really firm.... just different. It's disappointing. Not the worst but, definitely disappointing.",3
5/3/2023,"Price was great and delivery was quick. The mattress came in a box and was easy to set up. After two full days, I noticed the mattress was too firm and you can feel the springs. I laid on it and was uncomfortable. Luckily, it's just for the guest bedroom.",3
8/30/2013,"The mattress arrived in a timely fashion. It only took minutes to unwrap it with help. The mattress unfolded and opened to the twin size expected; however, since the mattress was purchased for a twin daybed, the support I expected from merely sitting on it was much less than anticipated. It was too soft ( for my likes) and it might be somewhat uncomfortable for an adult. The kids might enjoy it though.",3
6/5/2013,"I did not realize that the product came in a box, for some reason my mind was telling me that it was going to be delivered to me by two men, kind of like sears or macy. Nope it was delivered by FedEx and it was literally in box. It was easy to assemble and to unpack. I love it",3
6/19/2013,"I had a top of the line matrress for almost 20 years and decided it was time to change it. So I made the purchase to this simply 8-1. The Walmart service was incredible it was delivered free of charge and arrived before it's estimated delivery date.
The matrress itself is of lower quality than I am used to. Once you open the packaging it inflates to its normal size. The coils inside are made of plastic and the gel part of the matrress is rather soft for my taste. After I used it for one night I contemplated returning it and going back to my old matrress, but since I had already open the box and plastic wrapping It could not be returned.
I decided to give it a try for a bit longer maybe I'll grow accustomed to it.
In my opinion it has no sup...",3
11/7/2023,"for the money, a decent feeling mattress. Very convient to have had a mattress vacuumed sealed and shipped.",3
1/3/2024,Not as comfortable as I thought...needs a matress topper.,3
8/27/2023,the material is not bad but I think it would be higher than that because its very low and the bed too so i think of changing it by a higher mattress,3
10/17/2023,"Was expecting from the description for it to be medium firm or at least medium. This bed is super squishy, not much support.",3
7/25/2023,Decent bed for the price. Springs are very weak and collapse in on themselves only after a few months of owning the mattress.,3
3/21/2023,"It's ok, I had to return it, but the springs make the mattress very uncomfortable. Not a good mattress if you weigh more than 100lbs. You will feel the springs.",3
11/20/2023,too thin and too small for my full size box spring and frame,3
12/23/2023,received two items and charged for two items. Need to return one item,3
11/22/2023,Nice mattress but too soft for my liking.,3
12/9/2023,Decent mattress for the price,3
12/20/2023,I thought it was a memory foam but it has wire. Got it for good price but didn't like it.,3
5/29/2016,"Delivery was prompt and watching it expand from out of the relatively small box was entertaining. Very firm and a little noisy (squeaky). It makes a great guest room bed, keep them from staying too long. LOL.",3
4/3/2022,So I purchased 2 of the king size 8in mattresses for my sons rooms and well for a mattress in a box its ok!! The reasons I gave ot 3 stars is because (1). The mattresses are not the true size as advertised..its says its supposed to be 80x76x8 but they really are a 77x74x8 surprisingly it actually rose up to the 8 inches...I even purchased the Zinus king size metal frame so it would match up but it does not! the other reason for the 3 stars is the edges have no support it will put you in the floor....but overall the firmness is good...But they really need to fix the size and the edges of the mattresses!!!,3
9/22/2017,"I was really impressed seeing a mattress coming folded inside of a box. It works really well for me, but I'm disappointed that the mattress had few a dark spot.  I would recommend it to someone to buy it but when your purchase a new product you expected it to be very clean. There were 2 dark spots as you can see in those pictures.",3
7/30/2021,"This is a bed that should not be used everyday.   From reading the  one star ratings the problem is that the bed performs very well until the springs give out.    Failures happen as soon as two months for some,  1 year after daily use, and sometimes 2 years after daily use.   The 10 year warranty is misleading.   The product cannot perform daily for 10 years.   People are so disappointed that they just dump the mattress.",3
9/18/2016,After seeing all the reviews about this mattress I had no doubt that I would purchase this mattress for my son's room. But after receiving it I'm not sure that it was a five star rated buy. You can feel the metal coils in it when you move and it seems a bit thin. My son has no complaints though so overall for the price it is a decent buy.,3
1/30/2013,"I have had this mattress for about a week now, and I was a little surprised when I opened it. It does not look anywhere near as thick as it does on the website! I honestly thought they had shipped me the wrong item. The mattress is comfortable, but I have woken up every night sweating! It seems that the memory foam in it is trapping my body heat. I have to get out of bed just to cool down, which I never did before.
All in all, it's a nice mattress if you're looking for something quick and affordable, but I probably would purchase something else if you can afford it.
I had it shipped to the store, and the box fit fine in my Honda Civic sedan. That is definitely one benefit to the mattress!",3
3/27/2014,"Looks great came in a box and expanded,however even having it out for several days and finally laying on it I think it would still need a box spring, we purchase these mattresses to go with our kids platform bed that we also purchased from Walmart..the beds were great and great directions and this mattress fit on the bed,overall it was ok for the value and what we needed for now for a three year old",3
6/23/2013,"I was not sure whether to buy this since I have read the good and bad reviews mainly I was worried if it would hold up considering how some people have said that it more or less caved in after a while. I am overweight 174 and knew I was going to use this mattress much more than the average person. I suffer from fibromyalgia and have a great deal of pain and fatigue so the majority of my time IS in bed.

I have had this almost a month and it is holding up very well, it is quite firm so at times depending on how you are laying down it can hurt a bit but if I got a bit of a memory foam topper that could be easily resolved.

For the price YOU CAN'T GO WRONG!!",3
4/29/2013,"It was easy enough to unpack and set up by myself, which is saying alot because I have an injured wrist, but was still able to handle it alone. It is comfortable to sleep on, however I was expecting it to be a little more pillowey. My back is reaping the benefits of a firm, undented rest. I am still in the first few weeks of sleeping on it, but hope it stands the test of time.",3
7/5/2016,"This mattress is super comfortable and light. Good for my 3 year olds big girl bed. Only concern was the warning on the box on the flammability of foam.  There are a lot of chemicals on the mattress that they put on to protect the foam from catching fire. I wish that I had done some more research about that before buying it for my child. Seems like a great mattress so far, just not sure I want my child sleeping on a mattress with all of those chemicals.",3
3/11/2017,"Good quality for the money, not the  most comfortable for an adult, but great for a child",3
9/13/2023,Mattress arrived on time and opened up very well . It's been good . I recommend,3
9/5/2023,It was firm at first but sleeping on it was better than expected. Very good for price,3
10/24/2023,The mattress is soft and very comfortable for my eight year old. He sleeps like a log.,3
9/25/2023,"It's just ok. The coils can be felt through it, will definitely need a topper to be comfortable.",3
10/5/2023,i cant sleep on this mattress,3
10/12/2023,to thin not enough padding very uncomfortable,3
9/16/2023,if you sit or lay on it you can feel the springs in the mattress was not a good purchase,3
10/13/2023,A bit softer than expected,3
9/17/2023,nice mattress for the price,3
9/24/2023,The bed it not long enough for my frame I needed it a little bit bigger,3
7/12/2023,It makes sound every time you move. Makes so hard to sleep.,3
9/28/2023,It's looking good but too soft,3
8/7/2023,its ok. got a little stretchy after a couple days use. For the price it does an ok job,3
1/17/2013,Was expecting something else I was a bit disappointed it wasn't as thick as it looked in the picture but besides that it comfortable,3
4/12/2022,I like how quickly the mattress arrived but it's a little firmer than I prefer. There was also a flying ant squished against the mattress when I took off the vacuum seal.,3
7/10/2018,"I received the mattress in a box and wrapped in plastic, but with a big footprint on the mattress !!!! It's like they stepped on it to wrap it with the plastic! I was so disappointed!",3
7/18/2020,"Did not last 6 months, boxspring started squeaking and eventually broke....not sure if it couldn't handle the heavy mattress. Good buy for a guest room, not for everyday slumber.",3
9/10/2016,While this is an firm mattress it may be too hard for those we want an little cushion in their mattress also it does allow one to sleep without theri mates every move being known to them thought out the night,3
6/7/2021,not extra firm as it was billed but kinda on the softer side. My back hurts each morning if I sleep on it for 6 hours. My husband like it though. Otherwise it is decent,3
2/22/2017,It was fun to watch pop open. My kids feel they are very comfy. I bought 2 twin size. They both said best night sleep ever. Plan to purchase one for me. Time will tell how they hold up.,3
9/23/2013,"i bought mattress about 2 weeks ago, and it is very soft. At the beginning, I felt good but now my waist is so painful because mattress too soft hurt my waist.",3
4/10/2020,"I loved that it showed up in a box, super easy to take out of the box and puffed up nicely. However, it is extremely firm and almost feels like sleeping on the floor.",3
7/23/2016,It serves it's purpose for a guest room but not for everyday use. If you like low beds this is ideal because you don't need box spring.  This mattress cannot be used with regular bed frames.,3
3/2/2014,"I bought this for the guest room. I wish I had gone ahead and bought one of the all memory foam mattresses (I have one on my bed and like it), but this is ok for the occasional guest. I don't think I would like it for myself compared to the memory foam mattress I have, but it's a good value and an ok mattress. My only issue was the delivery by UPS. I had guests over the weekend and would have liked to have had the mattress, but thanks to the incompetence of UPS, it wasn't delivered on time (scheduled delivery was Friday). They waited until Tuesday of the following week (after an irate phone call to UPS customer service) to deliver it. I wish online retailers gave customers a choice of delivery carriers. I would NEVER choose UPS.",3
5/4/2020,This bed is really soft but it has some flaws. It sinks in some times but not all the time. It won't last long but it will do for now. I'm not a fan of the mattress in the box after this one. They are just not great for my husband and I. The softness is great but it's not firm enough to withstand time. If using temporarily then it would be ok but not full-time use. I probably would take it back but because of Covid-19 I can't.,3
11/16/2022,"I have had this mattress only a week or so, and it is already developing a dip in the mattress where I lie. I do not weigh much, so think it would be worse with a bigger person. I understand some of these mattresses form to a person, but it does not have the typical support that I would think it should have.",3
8/26/2013,"I was on a budget when I bought this mattress. I had little money to spend and had a short amount of time to purchase the mattress. Overall the mattress is OK to sleep on. I have a bad back and I was hoping for a firmer feel than what this feels like. I have been sleeping on this mattress about 3 weeks now. I think it will be just fine, however if you are looking for a mattress that you will sleep on for years to come this may not be the one for you. Also many people complained of the odor when first opening the mattress and mine had no odor at all.",3
11/21/2022,We've had it out of the package for over a week and the corners fold in on themselves with the slightest bit of weight.  The structure on the corners is practically non-existent.  Overall it's is what you would expect.  It's firm with a little give.  I just wish the corners weren't so flimsy.,3
7/7/2013,After reading all the rave reviews on this mattress I decided to purchase one for myself when I moved into a new apartment. I bought it with the intention for short-term use. I slept on this mattress for a week straight and encountered back pain. I've never had an issue with any other mattress before or back pain for that matter. I bought a memory foam topper and the back pain has subsided considerably but is still there. I am not using a box spring or box frame and the mattress seems to be fine by itself. I bought this mattress mainly for its value but I regret purchasing it. I would rather pay a little bit more money to find myself a less back-aching mattress!,3
8/10/2013,I was expecting a more cushioned mattress. I mean its a bit firm for me but my husband loves it. We placed it in the spare bedroom for company. It's a great deal. I will just be adding a mattress topper for my own comfort. but thats a personal choice.,3
4/8/2014,"This is a very comfortable mattress, and the convenience of having it in a box was great. It would be a five star mattress for me if it wasn't for the chemical smell that is still lingering. I didn't put sheets on it for 24hrs and it still smells. Hopefully goes away soon.",3
9/25/2022,"I took a shot at buying this mattress for my young daughters room since they say toddler mattresses should be more firm until they are older. This mattress is uncomfortable for both of us. She struggles to get comfortable and I get up achy if I have to lay with her. Its also pretty loud when you move on it like if you need to sneak out of the room after your kid is sleep. I cannot return it since it's been used for a couple of weeks so I will try a mattress pad while we find a new one. The springs can be felt with every movement. Even with the good price, I wouldn't recommend.",3
9/14/2020,I have 2 1/2 years with this bed and the side my husband sleeps on has a dent already by where his shoulders are. It's gotten uncomfortable for him to sleep on. Other than that the bed WAS comfortable before this happened so I already need to buy a new mattress,3
12/4/2018,"First off, this mattress is ""convenient"", affordable and serves it's purpose. It expanded quick out of the box as stated. The puns on the directions were hilarious. I had a good laugh. I let it settle for 2 days then tried it out. I have to get used to it because it's a little more firm than my other bed. Other than that, it's comfortable. The height of the bed is a little over 8 inches. Perfect and accurate. I'm happy about that. But the width on the other hand measures to be 56.5 inches exact, not 60. I measured it a few times to be sure I wasn't doing it wrong. My full sized bed is 53 inches in width, a little over the standard full size, so I didn't get much of an upgrade in terms of wanting a bigger bed. The mattress doesn't fit my que...",3
3/14/2017,"I bought this to replace my 17 year old son's mattress.  

The mattress arrived in two days, great!  It was rolled in a box, and was not heavy.  I unrolled and set it up easily on the bed.

Firmness-  Many said this is a firm mattress.  I would call it medium.  (We would have liked it to be ""firm"".)

Quality -  was decent for the price.  The spring wire is not as  heavy of a gauge as I thought it would be.   Mattress cover is of decent quality.  Although it moves easily, and bunches  up.  Adding a mattress cover made this even worse.

Value -  for the price that we paid, I would say we are happy.

 I can't comment on the durability of this mattress.  I do not see it lasting more than a year.  We will most likely have to replace this in a ye...",3
7/31/2014,This is a great matress for cheap money. with saying that you do get what you pay for though. It is comfortable but every now and than you can feel a spring or two. They dont poke out of the matress but you can feel them pop. Otherwise very good matress,3
11/9/2014,"Average bed, average price, etc. It is the neatest convenience how it comes in a very compact box. We added it to a box spring when converting the toddler bed to a full size bed. Hindsight, we could have purchased a mattress/box spring set for the same price we spent on both and it would have likely had a better quality for longer time. Perfect for him for the next 10 years but a grown couple would ware it out within a couple years.",3
10/10/2022,Mattress is as expected. Comfortable and economical.  Was not delivered on time. If the extra instructions or my phone number would have been shared with the driver it could have been delivered on time. Would only buy from Walmart if I could pick up at the store.,3
11/13/2013,"I was afraid it would be uncomfortable and it really is. For both myself and my husband we could feel the springs once we laid on it for more than 20 mins.
I wasnt disappointed and Im still giving it a good score because I believe the mattress was exactly what we paid for. We didnt have alot of money and it is worth the price we paid for it.
We are waiting on the mattress topper we ordered to arrive and hopefully that will solve our problem.",3
9/23/2013,You get what you pay for. You can feel the springs. Needs a foam cover...but out of stock :( It is also a bit narrow on the full size metal bunk bed we purchased it for. The sides flatten out and your legs sit on the metal frame when getting in or out.,3
12/21/2020,This was the cheapest mattress i could find and at that time that was all that mattered.  It is very soft....Too soft in my opinion. Also you can feel the springs in places. Would be great for a kids bed or guest room but after only 5 months of nightly use by my husband and I we already need to replace it. Waking up in pain every morning SUCKS. Wish i would have been able to save this money until i could afford something better to put it towards.,3
6/19/2014,"I bought this one thinking the king-size mattress is a usual bed size, It never to came to my mind to measure first the bed-frame to get exact size for the mattress, it's give me 4 inches space between the bed and the mattress. I already had a full size of this slumber bed and that was great, but this king-size mattress I don't feel comfy, it doesn't expand to well that i expected, kind of sloppy...But my son loved to sleep on it, he said it is soft. Totally i gave 3 stars for it.....",3
9/6/2016,"I really needed a mattress as cheap as possible and I was eyeballing this one out for a while. I saw the pretty good reviews so I just went for it. It arrived on time and the box was not damaged. I open it up and followed the instructions and let it inflate or whatever it does. It is quite thin. I had been sleeping on an air mattress so I couldnt wait to get back in a bed. The first night was ok then every night after that you can definitely hear the springs, and personally I get a backache. I would recommend it for a guest bedroom or where it is not used on the regular. I would not buy another one for my every night bed.",3
7/2/2014,"It could be because I had slept on a comfy 3"" memory foam topper for years before purchasing this mattress or it could be because I don't have much fat on my bones I but I found it too uncomfortable. I have now ordered another memory foam topper hoping to mitigate the too firmness of it.",3
1/4/2014,"The box weighs a ton. It really does immediately spring to life once unleashed. We got the Ireland King bed as well, which looks great, but for some reason, either the bed itself or the mattress, the bed is lower at the head than at the foot. It also bows in the middle. Will be better able to assess once we get a box spring but I'll have to pay the bed off first!",3
7/21/2016,"We purchased the queen size mattress on July 6th, and were informed that it would be delivered on July 14th. Then, we received an email to schedule the Delivery Appointment, and had to arrange our time to stay at home to receive the product. However, the delivery was delayed two times without prior notice. Then, we received the product on July 19. The problem is that a delivery person was irresponsible. He left the product in front of the building, instead of bringing it to our door. When I asked him to help move the box to my apartment, he refused, and told me that it was not his business. Such a bad delivery service ever...",3
4/8/2013,"When it said ""in a box"" I didn't expect it to be vacuum packed and rolled up and arrive in a box the size box an artificial Christmas tree comes in. It lays okay but there is very little support on the edges so just to sit on the edge isimpossible. I bought this for a spare room so it will get very little use so it serves MY purpose well. I would not recommend it for a bed that will get alot of use.",3
7/2/2014,"The mattress looks OK for the money but people must be careful when opening the box because you might cut it with the knife if you don't pay attention. The mattress is supposed to be 8 inches high, but mine reconstituted itself just to 6.5 inches. The foam did not fully inflate to 8 inches as stated on the website. The top is soft and the foam covers the metal springs well, but on the sides, you can feel the springs that are just covered with a thin fabric.
Besides these few things, the mattress looks nice and appears to be comfortable, Cannot say anything about durability, time will tell...",3
1/9/2014,"I purchased this for use as a guest bed, with the impression that I would not need box springs. I first put this on a metal bed frame and realized it needed more support. I then added wooden slats and that did not work. The mattress sill sagged. I ended up having to purchase box springs. If I had known this from the start, I would have purchased both mattress & box spring together, and would have saved a lot of money.",3
3/19/2017,"Bed inflated quickly. I set it up on the box spring and left it, per instruction.  Looking at it the next day, it appears to have a ripple in the middle and one of the corners bends in.  I've only had it a couple of days. Haven't slept on it yet. If the shape improves I will update the review.",3
12/10/2016,"This was the first time I've ever purchased a ""bed in a box"" and not as horrible as I thought but, definitely there are areas for improvement. I'm the type of person that loves soft, plush beds and this bed is on the firmer side. Overall, it is much better than any""blow up"" mattress....I'm not sure I would go this route again.",3
7/3/2013,"Odd that it comes in a box, rolled up- but don't let it fool you! Surprising comfort awaits! We purchased this for a regular use bed in a child's room. While I don't know if it would hold it's shape for regular use of an average adult- my 7 year old is very pleased with it! I would buy it again!",3
11/24/2013,"This mattress is delivered in a very compressed state, being packed into a box much smaller than the mattress itself. Upon removal from the box, it is stated that at least 48 hours should be waited to let the mattress ""relax"" before using. It would have been helpful to know that prior to purchase.",3
9/17/2014,was surprised how it was left here. In a tall box in front of the house. We opened the box and it started to open up into a bed. Poof. Before our daughter slept on it instead of her crib she would have to jump on the bed before she went to sleep. Now she no longer sleeps in the crib and loves her new bed.,3
4/10/2023,Comfortable but cannot flip over to the other side.,3
4/15/2023,Does it contain fiberglass? It's not stated.,3
6/4/2014,"El colchon es comfortable pero no es 8"" inches y nesesita box sprin y el precio 229.00 alto gracias",3
7/1/2014,"It appears to be a mattress made with a box spring, but it's only a mattress delivered in a box",3
6/17/2021,"uncomfortable. the center of the mattress is harder tan the sides, it feels like a hill in the middle.",3
10/15/2014,Good mattress for the price. Delivery was quick and the package was very small while the mattress was compressed.,3
8/30/2014,"We bought this bed for our eleven year old adopted son. I wouldn't buy it for an old guy like me with back problems, but for a kid it's perfect and for a good price.",3
8/10/2015,"Great mattress for a guest room as they won't stay long!! Feels like an old mattress from the fifties, squeaks and all. I will be replacing with the spa sensations mattress that I do love!!",3
9/17/2013,"A little thinner than expected, but is used for son""s bunk beds, so it should work fine. For the price, not a bad mattress, but would not put it to use for an adult over 200lbs.",3
2/24/2014,I was a little disappointed with the quality of this bed since I ordered one about 3 years ago that we loved. It appears the quality is not as good but it will meet our needs and shipping is great.,3
2/26/2013,The mattress is constructed well and seems like it will last. It is very soft so don't buy if you're looking for a firm mattress. it's great for a child.,3
2/12/2022,"Not truly firm, about medium and I can't find sheets to fit it. They are all mostly deep pocket or for mattresses 14” and higher. But this Zinus is pretty good quality for the price, looks nice anyway.",3
9/7/2014,"I wanted this for kids room thinking It won't have coils, My mistake as It was in box so thought It won't have coils. Its firm and you can feel coils. I want to return it but Its too much hassle now once It outside box.",3
9/5/2016,"Good, but somehow it is hard to get in and out of it. Maybe the twin size makes it hard. I got this one and a foam at the same time and prefer the foam one.",3
12/12/2016,"Recently moved to a penthouse apartment in the city and only purchased this mattress out of convenience (box in a mattress) and affordability. So far, no complaints :)",3
5/20/2014,"Bed inflated VERY quickly, which was a plus. But there's not even half an inch between the top of the bed and the springs. It feels comfortable at first but I had to get a bed topper due to how hard the bed became.",3
9/16/2022,The bed looks good but is so firm I could not even sleep on it so we looking to get a bed topper to make it a little bit more soft which is probably gonna be a4 to 6 inch topper but if you'd like a firm bed this is one for you,3
11/7/2022,"I think the bed is very nice, the price isn't too bad but I will say you get what you pay for. I ordered 1 King and 1 Twin sized bed, my king is disappointing but it serves its purpose and it was a convenient price :)",3
7/25/2021,Good price for a twin.  Seems like the firmness is not even across the entire mattress.  The outside edges seem softer than the inside.  This would probably be ideal for a younger person with no back issues but not great for those with any issues.,3
9/4/2013,"We just stared at the box for awhile scratching our heads thinking ""what the..."" Then, we opened the box and just started laughing at the shrink wrapped mattress!! But, it was needed for a month and it did the job. But, it was funny.",3
9/16/2022,"I love the sturdiness of the mattress, however I added a mattress topper to it because I can feel the springs. So when I get paid again I'm thinking about purchasing a different mattress.",3
9/2/2013,"The price was affordable, but the mattress is so firm that its not very comfortable. It is durable. it feels like sleeping in a pull out couch mattress. But the price was good for this type of bed. You get what you paid for.",3
3/8/2017,I am impressed how a mattress can be rolled up so tight in a box and puffy up to a regular size.  I needed a pretty firm mattress and ours was suppose to be but I really wish it was more firm.  I still wake my husband when I exit the bed too.,3
1/4/2013,"I have used it for barely 3 weeks now, but after initial days smell all is good.
Though I can't say it will last my 6 months stay in USA but so far so good",3
8/8/2016,"I don't give it 5 stars because we been sleeping for just 2 weeks, so far is really good! I will recommended  and for the price you can't complaint.

If it work, I am planning to buy 2 twins for my daughter's room.",3
11/12/2013,"I was confused at first on this purchase when it actually arrived in a box, I thought how could a mattress fit in a box, when I opened it , there was a mattress for the price it is an ok mattress, it is usable",3
2/15/2014,"For some people it is good but I prefer a firm mattress.
It has no edge support and that makes it feel even softer
It appears to be well made. I wish it was a little more solid.",3
12/3/2013,so far so good. my son seems to like it. he didn't like the smell when it first came outta the wrapping/box but that went away in a few days. can't say too much as he's only had it less than a month.,3
4/28/2017,"Arrived on time, easy to open and layout.  It was ready very quickly, however, it is just way to firm.  Just way to firm.  I'll have to purchase a soft mattress cover to compensate.",3
3/2/2020,Not really what I expected it to be . The mattress is not included this is just a frame and the headboard . I bought this 2 weeks ago and haven't put it together yet . Had to wait to be able to purchase the mattress.,3
7/29/2021,"Shipped fast, decent for the money. I bought this for my granddaughter and after two nights she said it is not as comfortable as her previous mattress.",3
3/9/2017,"I was impressed with how it was packaged, I ordered a king. It was a very soft mattress but not much for support. After about a week of sleeping on it, my boyfriend and I are pooling in the center of the bed.",3
8/30/2013,We needed something quick to go into the guest room ordered this and platform bed and we had a bed in the room for under $250. Can't beat it for price and will only be used every once in a while so should last. Seems comfortable enough too.,3
1/11/2017,"I bought the full sized mattress for guest room and everyone liked it , but the queen size didn't fill out as good as the full size , it's still a little saggy at the bottom",3
11/2/2015,"Not really sure how to compare the value of the product. This was for my son who returned from an overseas deployment and was transferred from California to Virginia.
Having been on two tours of duties in Afghanistan he only owned his vehicle and uniforms. He stated that it was tons better than his bunk in the desert :)

I ordered his mattress, box springs and living room furniture from Wal-Mart to be delivered to his new apartment. The mattress and Box Springs has been delivered, the living room furniture will be delivered November 12th.

The service was great just like during his deployments when I would drop ship things.",3
3/23/2013,"After reading the other reviews on this comforter set I wonder if I got the same one! I do not think it is cuter in person, I think it is much nicer in the photos. There is no dimension on this comforter, sewn or in the print, to make it appear dimensional as the photo leads you to believe. When I bought it I thought the squares were stitched and it would look layered - No!! It is just a print. And while this is okay for many comforters, I would not have chosen this bright and busy of a pattern if I had known it was just printed without any stitching or layers to break it up. The design as it is will most likely fade on the first wash - this I am concerned about.

All in all, I would recommend it to a friend, if this is what they're looking...",3
9/6/2011,"I've purchased 2 mattresses from Wal Mart, both 8"" twin. I bought this one & the Dorel mattress that was about $20 cheaper. The cheaper Dorel Signature Sleep Contour- 8"" Independently-Encased Coil Mattress is a much better mattress than this one. My only complaint about the Dorel mattress is that it's an inch shorter than other twin mattresses.

The Slumber 1 8"" mattress that was shipped does not look like the one in the picture online. It is advertised to have independent coils to minimize motion, but it feels just like another (cheaper) mattress that we have that's not advertised to reduce motion. It also claims to have heavier gauge steel coils, but this mattress compresses much more than the Dorel mattress does. All in all, it's an ok m...",3
8/24/2013,"I expected the mattress to come looking like the picture on the web site but it came rolled up like a sleeping bag, it did puff up but then it is a couple of inches shorter at the head and foot boards. When I questioned if the price was correct, of course, Customer service said I was charged the correct amount, I wonder? No where on the web site did it say the mattress would come rolled up and needed to be allowed to fluff up. I purchased here in Tucson to be delivered to Minnesota, not very happy at this point. They said it could be returned but that is not convenient for my Granddaughter.",3
6/21/2016,"As they say, ""you get what you pay for"". I thought it was pretty cool how compacted it comes and how it inflates super fast once opened. I haven't slept it in since it's for a guest bedroom. But i did lay on it and noticed that if i turned i felt the spring. I felt a few of them clunk. But if you don't move you don't feel them. Only when you move. I guess i should of gone for a memory foam for this price. No spring mattress can possibly be problem-less at this price. Oh well, at least the guest probably won't stay too long.",3
9/16/2014,"Human sleep needs vary by age and amongst individuals, and sleep is considered to be adequate when there is no daytime sleepiness or dysfunction. Moreover, self-reported sleep duration is only moderately correlated with actual sleep time as measured by actigraphy,[31] and those affected with sleep state misperception may typically report having slept only four hours despite having slept a full eight hours.[32]

Researchers at the University of Warwick and University College London have found that lack of sleep can more than double the risk of death from cardiovascular disease, but that too much sleep can also be associated with a doubling of the risk of death, though not primarily from cardiovascular disease.[36]",3
8/23/2011,"The box it came in was prtty bang up, but the mattress was ok inside, the packaging was a lot smaller then I thought it would be... it fit in my Versa and with a small dolly I was able to get it into my house without help. It was super cool watching the matress inflate! Very nice looking mattress. It is VERY FIRM! If you like a soft mattress this isn't it! The only soft part is the edges, they do sink down a bit if you are sitting on the edge putting your shoes on! I purchased a mattress pad to make it a little softer but even a 3 inch pad it is still firm but more comfortable. It is ok for the year I will be needing it, but I would not buy a mattress on line again.",3
9/15/2016,"The mattress arrived in a small box, I thought I made a mistake in my purchase. When I took it out of the box much to my surprise it started to expand into a full size mattress. It was like watching bread rise in the oven. I am very satisfied with my mattress and would recommend this mattress to my friends.",3
3/2/2018,"I just got it today and when I opened it so it can expand, it stunk to high heaven!! It does stink! The people that says it doesn't, must be employees! It's stinking up my whole apartment. I'll keep you posted after I let it sit for the 48 hours they suggest. Until then..,",3
11/11/2012,I ordered this product by seeing the video presented in this website. It is not a small bag and not easy to carry as well but the video shows a small bag & easy to carry. Please do not assume this product is weightless and easy to lift by watching the video. I have given 3 star rating because it was really very comfortable to use after unfolding it.,3
4/7/2021,"This bed is good for people who like very firm beds. I definitely don't, that's the only thing about buying a mattress in a box is that you cannot test it out. Definitely good price but I felt like I was sleeping on the floor. Also when it delivered, I understand as I live on the 3rd floor of an apartment that it can be difficult to lug it up the stairs, but the delivery driver decided to just set it in front of the apartment building stairs, without notifying me it was here. Very disappointing.",3
2/1/2017,The mattress I bought is for a twin bed. If I wanted to purchase another mattress I would buy a better one. It is definitely not firm enough. You can feel some of the spring coils. If I hadn't already gotten rid of the previous mattress I would try to return it.,3
3/2/2014,"This bed arrived in a very beaten up box, which chunks of cardboard taken out of the box and delivered to my house in the rain. Luckily I was at home when it came and it had plastic wrap around the mattress. Getting the mattress out of the box folded up was a challenge. Once I got it out, it expanded to a bigger size. I bought this mattress to go with a platform bed frame, which fit nicely onto it. However this mattress is very uncomfortable and you can feel the springs. I went out and bought a $40 memory foam piece to put on the bed, and now it feels like sleeping on a cloud. Without the memory foam, good luck trying to sleep!",3
5/9/2013,"When the mattress was delivered in a small box, rolled up like a camping bedroll I knew this was not what the man I ordered it for expected. I returned it without taking it out of the box because it would never have gone back in once inflated. I ordered a regular mattress from the same website at Walmart.",3
3/3/2017,"The bed in a box idea is interesting, but I haven't gotten around to actually sleeping on it yet. So I can't really comment on it's support or comfort.
One thing I have noted is the sides of the mattress don't have the accustomed rigidity that is expected from a normal box spring. If you side on the side of the bed while getting dressed, it may be a bit discomforting to sink in a lot more.
Right now, it's sitting in my living room while I try to figure out how to get it up to my bedroom and the old mattress out.
It would seem a much better idea to move the old mattress out to another room first, bring the BOXED new mattress to the bedroom and unpack and inflate it there. Just sleep on the sofa for a couple of days until the new mattress ful...",3
8/26/2013,"It's an acceptable mattress considering it comes totally smooshed and compressed into a very small box. When it arrived I thought it was a mis-purchase and that I had ordered an over priced mattress topper, that's the type of vacuum sealed compression wrap it came in! So be careful when you unfurl this thing, it springs to full size with a bit of force. Overall it's okay, it's better than the futon I was sleeping on. However this isn't one you keep for years like an Original Mattress or something like that.",3
3/17/2014,I purchased this mattress for my daughter. She said ot was squishy...and the sides are by very strong. If u sir on the edge u aren't going to.be stable. It sleeps nice though. If I could have tested it out b4iu wouldn't have purchasesd it but since i did I'm somewhat satisfied.,3
9/8/2016,soft on the edges and a little hard in the middle  but useable,3
8/24/2013,I got this for my 11 yr old girl and she loves it.....not sturdy enough for adults,3
8/18/2021,Was expecting an extra firm mattress. But much softer than I think. Cause persistent lumbago.,3

1/23/2023,I did not realize when I purchased that it had fiberglass in it. It was very comfortable though. Returning it is proving to be the biggest pain ever.,3
9/25/2022,very stiff. edges of bed drop off and lack support. fine for guests whom you do not wish to entertain very long.,3
10/6/2022,I received a full size bed instead of queen! It's definitely was 8 inches just received the wrong size.,3
9/8/2021,"The mattress it is good, but the walmart delivery it is very slow. The product arrived 5 days later.",3
4/4/2017,A little thinnervthen I thought but comes. Wrapped like a cylinder so it was easy to get into my apartment,3

2/28/2014,Very uncomfortable reminds me if sleeping in the barracks in ft Leonard wood.had to spend another 130 for mattress topper the next day,3

2/3/2022,the mattress was comfortable  but even with rotating over the year we had it it had sunk spots like at the ends for some reason have collapsed.,3
2/9/2013,Bought this mattress for my teenaged son abut a month ago. He loves it! It's firm and comfortable so far.,3

7/16/2016,"Seems firm when no one is on it, but as soon as someone sits down, it sinks in like its compressing again. My son loves it anyhow and says it very comfortable to sleep on.",3
3/27/2014,I thought I ordered the wrong thing once I got it. But when I opened the box up and the mattress started to expand I found it pretty cool. It's very comfortable.,3
5/19/2020,I haven't even opened the box. It's still in package as it was when delivered. I'm rethinking the tiny home I was planning to buy in which I was going to use it.,3
6/7/2011,"Its okay I think my son sleeps well in it, but I find it not that comfortable it kind of sags when you sit on it. I mght end up using this for a trundle and getting a better top mattress.",3

Overall, for the purpose that I bought it for, its great so far!",3
11/23/2013,"I have ordered a number of items from Walmart and had them shipped to the Store and everything worked fine. I made the mistake to select ""Ship to my home"" and this meant Fedex delivered the item. The box was opened and thrown on my lawn 50 feet from my house in the rain. Fedex uses ""contract"" firms for ground shipment and does not back up the delivery and cannot explain the background of who the ""contractor"" hires. BEWARE!!!",3
1/30/2015,"Wow after reading all the great reviews on this mattress I decided ok let me give it a try. First night, too soft so I thought, well maybe it hadn't fully compressed so let me see if it's a bit firmer the next night. Nooo my legs were numb and I'm a side sleeper so when I woke up, my whole side was just numb. then I noticed that the mattress that I have doesn't look like the picture. I called the company to complain and was told that I have the ""newer"" version... needless to say that it went back the next day.
Let the consumer know that you have a ""newer"" version that you're sending them.
Not happy and completely dissatisfied with this mattress",3
3/16/2021,I got this mattress back in February of 2016 I'm 5'3 185lbs the bed lasted about 3 years or a little less than before the springs started to pop. I sleep in the middle and All of 2019 and 2020  I suffered from back pain because the bed formed large indents.  Ive kept it for so long because I thought I could remedy it by purchasing a mattress topper but after a while that didn't work either. I tried to look for a warranty on the bed but couldn't find it. So I've finally had enough and decided to purchase a new mattress I went with a different brand this time around.,3
12/2/2014,"I just received my mattress yesterday. After reading many of the customer reviews I expected to flop down onto a cloud but not so. The springs in the mattress don't allow for sinking as I expected. The bed IS soft but firmer than what I wanted. However, there is still hope because I haven't slept on it yet; I just laid on it briefly before having to leave. Part of the problem could be that it may not have been expanded all the way because I laid on it a couple of minutes after it expanded from the box. The factory air compresses the mattress and rolls it up so it will fit in a small box. Remarkable, really. So, perhaps it needed more time to fluff out or something. I will update when I've slept on it. Overall, so far, it seems like a good q...",3
7/6/2016,This was a new mattress for our 2year old and her new big girl bed. It is soft and she loves having her new bed,3
12/27/2015,"Everything was fine with it. No problems. As advertised except it seems too firm for us. We ended up buying a 3"" topper and now it sleeps great.",3
3/21/2013,I am still waiting for it to inflate. It stated that it will take 48 hours. I started on 3/20 and on 3/21 it has not inflated to its full level.,3
11/3/2015,They have not slept on them yet waiting for the weekend so they spend the night. I sat on them they seem to be okay.,3
8/14/2013,It was way thinner and flimsy than expected. But all things considered an air mattress would have been better.,3
12/15/2016,cloth is not good.,3
4/29/2015,Good for a guest bedroom not for your everyday sleeper I bought this mattress a couple of months ago shipped right away and I received them earlier then expected overview says mattress will settle in with a inch difference from purchase date my suggestion is not to watch television in bed it will say where you sit great price but you get what you pay for,3
2/26/2016,"I ordered online because, 1st it was on sale & 2nd I didn't have a way to get a mattress home from the store. I was amazed how they packaged this mattress into a box and how nicely it unfolded and became a mattress! The only complaint that I have was that it smelled funny, kind of a musty smell. With no way to get it back into the box or carry it into a store, I sprayed Fabrezz on it and left the sheets off of it to air out. We'll see. Hopefully, the smell goes away.",3
2/23/2014,"I bought this mattress for myself, I'm 180 lbs. I bought one of the adustable beds and it required a latex or foam mattress so I tried this one. Sitting and briefly laying on the mattress made me a bit concerned because I could definately feel every coil. I slept on it last night for the first time and it felt like I've been beat up ! This is not a mattress for a bigger person because yu will wake up in pain. We've had the mattress for two days now and my teen daughter slept on it the first night and loved it so it's very comfortable for a smaller person. The shipping was fast and conveniant but I'm returning it today to my local Walmart.",3
3/9/2018,"The mattress itself is quite impressive for the price but the smell is horrid! Ive had the mattress for just over a week and it still smells. I opened the window to air it out and that helped a little but not enough. Im tempted to return it but that will be extra work so Im gonna try some Lysol spray, dryer sheets and an air purifier first. Its a shamw really cause the mattress feels pretty good but because of the smell I would not buy again",3
1/6/2021,"The mattress itself was okay, pretty good for the price and seems to be a decent spring mattress. Our biggest concern when we opened this mattress, however, was the amount of plastic wrap that it comes in. By the time we had unwrapped it, it was quite literally covering half of the room. If you are conscious about packaging and environmentally friendly products, this mattress is definitely not for you. Disappointed!",3
5/26/2015,"This is a great mattress for our 4 year old. I'm hoping we can get 4 to 5 years out of it. We converted his toddler bed to a full size and were looking for a cost effective option that received good ratings. This mattress does just that. It is pretty comfortable - he sleeps well on it. A little springy, but great for the price.",3
9/14/2017,"I bought one of these perhaps 5  years ago and it was (and still is!) amazingly comfortable (not to mention incredibly good value for money). Unfortunately, when I therefore ordered exactly the same mattress again (because after five years of constant use and mistreatment the old one had developed a slight depression where my heavy husband's torso was) the new one looks identical to the old but is dramatically more firm -- so firm that I've had to order a different mattress. I should say that I much prefer bouncier (softer) pocketed springs, not just firm springs with a layer of soft foam or whatever on top, because I find that that supports me better. That kind of mattress seems increasingly hard to find in USA. So if you are looking for a...",3
5/28/2015,"We thought this would work for a lake cabin that's not used often. The twin mattresses we received look nice, feel good at first, but don't provide enough support for a night's rest. I think they'd work fine for children or small adults, but an average adult (much less a guy over 200 lbs like my husband) feels it collapse if you lay near the edge, and it's too soft for hours of sleep.
We can't have our visitors use these, but I could recommend them for a child's room perhaps. We took ours back and bought a standard mattress.",3
10/16/2012,My bf wasn't too fond of it coming in a box..too awhile for it to actually expand to the size that its suppose to be up to..we've had the matteress for about a month now..so far it's okay..not the best but u pay for what I get..(note: u probably do not need to bring a pick up truck to pick this item up) hope this review helps,3
2/27/2011,"great price, needs more padding, add a little more padding and it's a great bed.",3
1/26/2013,GOOD VALUE NOT FOR EVERYDAY USE UNLESS IT'S A CHILD.,3
9/6/2012,"I am a very thin guy, but when I sit on the edge of the bed it sinks like 2 inches.",3
8/15/2011,Good for college or guest bedrooms,3
7/24/2020,Beginning to sag a little where you mostly lay. Too firm and no give. Use a mattress topper,3
7/20/2013,It was wild to see this Queen size bed come out of this little box. You get what you pay 4.,3
1/27/2017,Ok but not worth the money,3
11/25/2016,I bought it for my nephew and he said it feels to him.,3
1/28/2015,Mattress was purchased for my daughter she states it's a little to hard. Overall I would purchase this again.,3
6/7/2013,"You definitely need a box spring or something to support it. A reviewer said she didn't need a box spring only because her bed frame raised it. It was comfortable, though.",3
7/15/2014,"I bought king size, It looks good but causing back pain. I don't know the exact reason but its happening with this bed. When ever I sleep on other bed, I am not having any pain. SO something wrong with this only.",3
5/30/2018,"It's only been about a week, so far so good. So I gave it 3 stars. I did add a mattress cover and an two inch 5 zone mattress topper which has added to the comfort level.",3
11/24/2012,"The bed arrived in the mail rather quickly, and the packaging was solid. Set up was quite easy, for the most part, just had some fumbles trying to get the plastic off the bed. Within a few hours the bed was fully inflated and to its respectable size. My previous bed was a Queen ""Tiffany"" BeautyRest Pillow-top, it was 10 years old and needed to be swapped. In comparison, this slumber mattress is squishier it sinks in more when I sit on the corners and the sides. The support to slight firm but soft , I did feel it being a bit springy maybe because I'm used to sleeping on a pillow-top, but it still did have a more squishier feeling overall. There is no foul spell, just smells like plastic when you first open it, but nothing noticeable like oth...",3
12/24/2018,"I read most of the reviews before purchasing this product.  However I don't recall anything being said that it takes 24-48 hours to fully expand.   The mattress is what you pay got it.  It's not all that comfortable yo lay in all day like one I had, but it's not unsleepable either.",3
5/16/2016,Bought this for my 4yr old son. It was easy enough to set up. Its very heavy but was able to do get it upstairs with the help of my 7yr old. It would be way to firm for me to sleep on but he doesn't seem to mind. Major complaint was the delivery process. I ordered from Walmart instead of Amazon because it was $20 less but not worth it in the end. It was delivered 3 days later than it was promised.,3
9/24/2015,"I picked up this mattress to put in a 2011 fifth wheel camper as the one that I had in there was a residential queen mattress that was too heavy. So the weight of the Slumber mattress was good, very light. And it was just $200+ with tax. I looked great in the camper as I left it in the parking lot of RV dealership. I did actually sit down on it, and it felt just as good as some of the mattresses that come in RVs.
If you want an inexpensive mattress in a hurry... this is the mattress and the place for you. I ordered it Sunday evening, it was at the store by Wednesday afternoon. :)",3
2/11/2020,"Looking to return the item. It's not 76 × 80 inches as advertised in king size, but is 1.5 in shorter on each side, 74.5 x 78.5, leaving lots of slop on my bed frame (sits inside). The springs are not ""extra firm"", but are very bouncy and not stiff for a supposed extra firm matress.

I can only pray return is possible.",3
7/5/2014,so we get the bed and i was a little susceptible about buying a bed out of a box but 3 months latter it still is an awesome bed for the price of this bed i would tell any one that wants a brand new never used bed to get this bed the only down side it you have to wait like 72 hours till its in its full form,3
10/2/2015,"The mattress feels like a real bed except it is a bit firm. I am around 50 years old and after waking feel like I am 80. This was better than those cheap air mattresses, but too firm for me. I have slept on expensive pillow top beds and cheap air mattresses. This mattress falls somewhere in the middle - not bad, but not great - 3 stars.",3
7/29/2015,I bought a queen sized mattress for my young daughter's new bed. For the price this mattress was a great fit. I have found that you definitely need something underneath to support it - either a box spring or plywood foundation. All in all very good deal for a mattress.,3
2/17/2020,"just bought and received this mattress in size queen about 10 days ago the first few days my back felt sore prehaps its was a feeling out process , after the initial few days my body got used to the firmness feel,  and i am happy with the purchasei get a good nights sleep  i would probably not buy another but would recommend walmart.com for bedding",3
7/9/2019,"I am very confused. I bought this mattress in a queen size and it was great- firm but still comfortable. I never had any issues with it. I moved to a new apartment and had to downsize so I purchased the full size. The mattress is sinking in in the middle where I lay on it. It's hurting my back so I have to return it. I don't know if it's some manufacturing flaw? Not sure why this didn't happen on the queen, but is happening with the full size.",3
3/24/2019,"I bought this mattress believing it would be the answer to my prayers.. After reading dozens of reviews praising this mattress as being so comfortable! Even people with health problems praising it! I was really impressed with how simple it was to unbox and how it expanded and looks so much like a store bought mattress! I actually decided on buying it because my niece and nephews all sleep on a bed in a box.. (Not sure if it is this exact brand);  I allowed it to expand for several days before even sleeping on it! My hopes soon died, though!  The first night I slept on it I didn't get one hour of sleep! I have put a Serta 2.5 inch memory foam topper on it and it has helped, alot.. The memory foam is the only way I am able to sleep on it, at ...",3
1/17/2018,"I desperately needed a new mattress as my 5 year old Sealy was terrible. I didn't want to spend much because I only need the mattress for about 8 months and then I'm getting married and moving. I guess that this mattress will do the job....sort of. 
The mattress is very firm. It has a nice, but thin, little pillow top. It was way to hard by itself so I added a puffy mattress pad, a fluffy comforter, and a high quality 2 inch memory foam topper on top of all that. Then my sheets. NOW it's comfortable. I already had all of those other things, so I only had to buy the mattress. So, I'm happy with it now.",3
5/8/2015,"My slumber one came in January 2015. Very easy to set up, and at first I was very impressed. However, its only been 5 months and already I can see a 'sinking in ' in the middle of the mattress. I weigh 160 lbs. and find it hard to believe that this could happen based on my weight. I wonder if anyone else has had this problem. Its certainly not bad enough that I cant sleep on it, but just a bit of a disappointment.",3
3/8/2014,"We purchased the twin mattress for our 8 year old. I was a little reluctant to buy a mattress online without first seeing the quality, especially a ""mattress in a box"", but figured if it was bad we could return it.
It came in a box light enough for the small female Walmart associate to carry to the site to store pickup desk and small enough to fit in a car and once unrolled it expanded quickly (if you have children do this in front of them) leaving just a little more expansion after removal of the plastic cover.
As far as support goes it differs from a standard spring mattress only on things like sitting on the side, where it has far more give. I tried laying on it and it supported my 180lbs comfortably. It molds to body contours more preci...",3
11/30/2014,"I wondered what a mattress in a box was like and if it was really going to be comfortable...well, all I can say is you ""get what you pay for."" It's cheap, just like the cost. Don't forget to throw a mattress topper on it, that's what I did, otherwise it hurt my back. I will be reselling after the holiday. Good luck.",3
12/14/2022,It was a five star at first but it didn't last 18 months. At like a year it had a dent. And now at close to 18 months springs are broke all over the bed. I usually keep mattresses over 5 years and this one didn't last no where near that. Now i just had to waste more money to order a new bed because now it feels like im sleeping on bricks.,3
8/9/2015,"This bed is very soft. If I seat on it, I sink. However, when i lie down I do not, as my weight get distributed through all my body. But still it feels soft, but I am not sinking. I am not sure if this will work for long time. My impression is that in one year I would need to change it. I like firm beds, but so far I slept well on it. It is kind of contraction I know.
The biggest complain is the size. I ordered a queen, and I thought I received a double. But not, it was a queen. The smallest queen ever. Check the size careful. If you are looking for a queen, maybe opt for a king.",3
6/30/2012,"For the price of this mattress... One can't really complain. I don't feel like this mattress is for someone who needs a permanent solution. The reason I ordered online was because I liked that it was compressed for shipping and I was also pressed for shopping while out of the country. Because they compress it, this particular mattress does not have any support on the outer frame so getting in and out of bed at times you feel the cheapness of the product. It sinks in a lot when you sit on the edge. I know it wasn't made for sitting on but it does happen and it isn't comfortable at all. I am looking to repurchase something better quality once the summer is over.",3
7/22/2015,"I just received this mattress. I woke up a few times during the night because the bed is too hard. I purchased this bed on sale and I will be getting a 2 inch foam topper which will make it more comfortable. I had no problem getting it out of the box and placing on bed. The bed itself had no issues, no smells, etc. I would recommend purchasing the same bed but in the pillow top.",3
6/28/2016,"No edge support, so heavier persons might fall off if they sleep near the edge. It is best to sleep near the middle of this mattress.

Otherwise, good combination of plush and support (in middle). Elsewhere it felt like sleeping on an air mattress. Disclaimer - combined weight of sleepers is around 380 lbs.",3
7/31/2018,"I am a little disappointed with this mattress. After reading the reviews, I bought this for my son who has a bad back and needs a firm mattress.  It was great for the first 3 weeks but then it became soft.  My son just moved into his apartment so he has the mattress on the floor while waiting for his furniture to arrive and even being on a hard floor it still lost its firmness. My son only weights 140 pounds.",3
2/10/2020,This mattress is comfortable and seems supportive on the body. But advertised as 80 inches in length? When measured after a week of it expanding.. it is only 74 inches long. My bed frame is 81 inches. So the end of the mattress seeps down on the planks and I have to put cardboard down there to support. Not a good sight. Hopefully they aren't all like this.,3
2/23/2015,"I did not want the hassle of going to the mattress store - it's almost as bad as buying a car. So this is a very convenient alternative. I was concerned when the box arrived with some tears. The mattress started to 'inflate' before I even started to take off the last plastic sheet. So I'm not sure if the package handling caused this. The mattress fluffed up pretty quick. It does have a little smell but it goes away pretty quick. Overall the mattress is comfortable. The biggest problem I notice is that if you sit on the edge of the bed, there is not much support and the mattress sags.",3
8/13/2019,This mattress is not very soft at all. My husband and I can feel the springs when we lay on it. But we got it for our 5 year old son and loves it. I don't think he's heavy enough to feel them. This mattress was extremely inexpensive though and will last us a few years.,3
11/12/2014,"Was delivered on time. Mattress comes rolled up in a box wrapped in plastic, the minute you cut away the plastic the mattress pops out. Matress is VERY firm. Not the most comfortable. Size is true. Corner end of both mattresses I ordered are bent down and will not straighten with rest of mattress making it awkward to lay down. I ordered a bed frame as well and no box spring is needed, bed doesn't bend between the bars. Would recommend for guest bedroom or childs room.",3
3/16/2020,"i had the slumber 1 10 inch mattress before this. i ordered this one not knowing that the padding would be much less than the 10 inch mattress. if i would have known that u would have just gotten the 10 inch again. 
it doesnt even really look like a pillow top at all. 
dont buy this if your expecting a regular pillowtop because your not gonna that.",3
10/30/2015,"Mattresses are strange though they do come in a box so I guess I should've known they'd be ""off"". Nothing like a ""regular "" twin mattress. After purchasing 3 I discovered Sealy mattresses at my local Walmart for the same price. I was pretty disappointed. Kept these though as I didn't have time to haul all 3 to the store to exchange. My kids said they're somewhat comfortable but my 10 year old woke up yesterday saying her back hurt...That's definitely not normal! Overall they're usable but I recommend getting a regular mattress instead if at all possible.",3
7/23/2012,"Loved having it come to the door in a box no bigger than the one that holds my Christmas tree, it is comfortable but obviously not a mattress that will last ten years. Great for my kid to take to college and will last her throughout without any problem. I really like that there is no wire framing around the springs.",3
4/29/2018,"I am not sure if this mattress was damaged in transit or not, on side is inflated up to 8 inches the other barley 7 inches. Tried laying on it! One side is comfortable and the other side feels as though the springs are stuck can't get it back in the box to send it back and suggestions?",3
8/7/2021,When we unwraped our mattress it did not expand well and had a lump forwards the of the foot of the mattress.   I don't think this was a manufacture issue.  Unforunately the mattress was misrouted and sat in Fed Ex Hub for over a week before we received it.,3
5/23/2015,"It was easy to transport. Getting it out of box and unrolled was fairly simple. That said, laying on it feels like lying on a board. It is by far not the softest mattress I've ever laid on. It does have a 10 year warranty. Stain and other normal wear on a mattress void the warranty. I'd have a mattress cover ready next time (if I did) order another.",3
3/5/2016,"Make sure you read a dozen or more reviews, good and not so good. This can be the perfect product for some but the total opposite for others. If you want a day bed, guest room, small child's bed, or extra layer dorm room mattress, this may the product for you. Can't say how it sleeps, didn't even take it out of the box.... not what I expected.
Oh, it does come in a box that's smaller than the actual size of the mattress, even taking into account that the mattress is rolled -up.",3
10/2/2019,It was delivered to the right place quickly and the Walmart associate who helped me load this AND the bed frame into my car was really amazing. Smelled fresh and looked clean out of the packaging and it expanded in a good amount of time. Giving it 4 stars just because the firmness wasn't right for me and my pressure points are aching. Having to sleep on a separate pillow for comfort and currently looking online for a thick mattress topper.,3
10/22/2012,"Mattress arrived promptly. It fit the trundle frame under my daybed. Was fairly easy to unwrap (I'm 74 and did it myself). Has a nice appearane and is firm. No one has slept on it yet, but I'm sure it will do for visitors. Not sure I would want to sleep on it all the time. I guess if I were going to, I would by a memory foam mattress topper.",3
5/16/2015,"The mattress is nice, very easy to set up and really nice condition. However I am a belly sleeper and my back is hurting after just 2 days. I wish we would have gotten the 10"" I don't know if they will let us exchange or not . But I don't know if I should just get another or what to do.",3
4/28/2018,"After opened it out this mattress, the smell is really strong, like something is wet and damp, I opened the window let the air coming to the room, hoping it'll get over the bad smell, but it still there. I am thinking whether to return or not? I have not use it at all, I brought this is for guest room, it's not going to use it till July!",3
11/18/2012,Not really firm enough.,3
3/29/2014,very good quality,3
4/18/2011,The mattress does not have much support or cushion to it.,3
5/20/2012,As good as any $600 mattress that I tried. Best bang for the buck out there.,3
1/14/2012,The matress is really plush. It tends to make my back hurt but maybe its because Im used to the firm matresses. However its a great look and comfort for the buck if you like plush matresses.,3
9/3/2015,"If you are looking for a comfortable mattress for a low price, this is something yo look at. I purchased this for my son who is attending college and needed a comfy mattress for the year.",3
1/14/2015,The mattress is okay. I wish it were little harder as I prefer hard mattress. It is hard to judge when you shop online. It was delivered 5 days later than the planned shipping date.,3
5/18/2016,"Love the way it came in a box. Easy to get where I needed it. Hysterical when it unrolled! A hard mattress, but comfortable. Using on a bed that will be used occasionally.",3
3/16/2019,Its comfortable when you lie down. I have been sleeping on the mattress for about five weeks and lately wake up with a backache. I will try a memory foam topper to see if it helps,3
3/22/2016,I had purchased the same twin mattress which was so comfortable. The queen does not have the same comfort and feel that it may not have expanded to its fullest height.,3
7/3/2019,Three months ago my response in the review would be VERY different. My Bed in a box was perfect until the springs concaved causing physical pain and other issues. The bed has a ten-year warranty and Zinus refused to send a replacement as promised.,3
12/7/2014,This is comfortable enough but definitely requires a mattress cover as this is encased in a cotton that will pill easily and absorb anything it comes in contact with.Needed a bed quickly.,3
9/12/2015,"The mattress was packed in the box. It did make pick up and delivery easy.
According to website description, the mattress was rated as firm (3).
It is soft, it reminds me airbed, which lost some air.",3
4/11/2018,I ordered the twin  it says it's 75by39 now it is only 73 in  now I got a 4 inch gap my bed was 77  in but I figured 2 in not bad but 4 is to much what can I do,3
11/26/2019,"Very comfortable mattress, not disappointed about that aspect. The edges of the mattress are not firm. Sitting on the side of the bed feels precarious. The middle of the bed feels a bit higher than the rest. Would not order this again.",3
3/6/2016,"I order a queen size and when we put it up it was the same size as our full size bed! We needed a bigger bed, not the same size! It sleeps fine but it's not big enough.",3
11/28/2015,"If you cannot leave the house to purchase a standard mattress, this will do but it won't be as firm. It ended up costing $40 more than the one I moved to other room and is not as nice.",3
4/18/2011,"This item arrived quickly and was ingeniously vaccuum packed. I unrolled it, unfolded it and it inflated to normal size within minutes after puncturing the plastic wrapping. A $200 queen mattress did the trick.",3
5/5/2016,This is the 2nd we've purchased. It's a great guest room mattress that doesn't get a lot of use . We got 4 years out of the last one so it was a great choice for the money.,3
8/27/2019,Get what you pay for. If it's your everyday sleeper you're gonna start getting some back pain in about a month. Would not recommend without a good memory foam topper to go with it.,3
11/26/2012,GET THE MATTRESS IN TIME FOR MY GUEST BED ROOM. AFTER THE FIRST FEW NIGHTS MY GUEST STATED THAT IT WAS SINKING IN THE MIDDLE. SO I WILL BE RETURNING IT TODAY. PLEASE SAVE YOU MONEY IF YOU WANT YOUR GUEST TO HAVE A SMOOTH NIGHTS REST.,3
7/1/2020,I thought the mattress would be firmer with springs. I mean it's ok but its kinda squishy.  It's for my travel trailer so it's acceptable.  I do like that it came in a box which was easy to life. I mean it's ok.,3
12/7/2014,I paid for expiedited shipping and it came way late. the mattress itself is ok but when you get it out of the box it springs open so make sure you have room for it to expand,3
8/23/2019,"For what it is and how much it was, it's a good deal. I would not suggest buying this mattress without a topper. You can feel the springs as you sit and lay on it. But with a topper, it gives just the right support to make it comfortable.",3
12/29/2014,"I expected another kind of mattress, maybe a little softer because at times I feel uncomfortable, and sometimes wake up feeling unrefreshed in the evening!",3
5/26/2019,"Great product for the first 2 years of owning it. With proper rotating, at almost the exact 2 year mark it is now killing my back. Typical Walmart product; great for its price range, but dies a lot sooner than other brands",3
2/4/2020,This mattress is OK for a temporary guest bed.  For me with the back problems I have it was replaced for a locally bought mattress costing substantially more,3
3/14/2019,Not as comfy as we thought! Bed is a little hard and with no give! Have been sleeping on it for a week now and hoped it would get better. Husband loves the bed. Just not for me!,3
11/9/2014,"When you lay down on this mattress it does holds you up well, however if you sleep on your side or press on it with your hands you can feel the individual coils and even hear them. More cushion is needed.",3
2/10/2020,It's not the greatest . But you get what you pay for. I can already feel the springs after only having it for 2 months (nothing crazy tho) i think it's better for kids not adults.,3
5/12/2015,it is a good mattress for the price it would have been nice if they told you it is a squishy mattress not much firmness at all. other than that it rolled out and up really quick and was at height in a couple hours,3
10/25/2015,My husband doesn't seem to mind it but its way too firm for my liking. Im planning to buy a mattress topper to soften it up. Ok for the prize but not my taste.,3
10/3/2019,"Pretty firm I'm a side sleeper and woke up pretty achy, but my husband is a back sleeper and liked it so just depends on what kind of sleeper you are and mattress you prefer if you like firm it'd be the bed for you!",3
9/4/2012,"When the box arrived, I thought they sent the wrong item. The mattress came rolled up in a small rectangular box and unraveled when we opened it. It definitely is not a firm mattress. We got it for our toddlers first twin bed so it is fine and worth the money but we will probably buy a new one in a few years as I think it will be too soft by then. So depending on who and what you are buying it for, will depend upon whether it is worth it to you or not. Good luck!",3
3/27/2016,If you have back issues please stay away from this mattress. this mattress is for normal people and best life longer. But if you have Spine issues or back pain you suffer and suffer from your back. other then is great mattress stronger mattress you will need some addition like some foam on top.,3
9/7/2015,"It was shipped fast. Easy to open. Slight chemical smell at first but gone next day. Expanded mostly right away, fully expanded in 32 hrs. To soft. No support. Im a big guy though (6'1' 325lbs) but i feel my frame when i move. Its decent for its price. Good for guest not regular use.",3
2/19/2012,"i do not think full review at this early onset would be complete. i will say that the convenience of a simple box that can be hauled in anyone's subcompact car is of excellent value in itself. the item was easy to maneuver, easy to open, and did the self inflate thing well. i have not spent a full night on this bed, but it really does feel comfortable. i do highly recommend this mattress for its convenience and price to anyone in need of a quick mattress. (remember, though, once opened, it cannot 'reshrink'). i cannot attest to longevity or ongoing comforts, but the starting shows well.",3
1/20/2016,"BE CAREFUL with this order, it'll make you think you're buying a queen/king sized bed, and a single will arrive at your doorstep (as it did mine). ...The options aren't at all intuitive or correct in any way shape or form in that specific order form.
...Otherwise, the bed is very comfortable, I haven't slept this well in years.

1/11/2018,For the price the mattress isn't bad  it has a lump/mound in the middle of the mattress I feel like I'm climbing uphill,3
8/15/2018,Top and bottom edges still bent inward. Never fully expanded in those areas. The middle of the mattress is very comfortable though.,3

7/17/2020,I like the quality of the mattress but it's to firm for me and it almost to thin . I like a thick mattress,3
3/10/2019,It is for back sleeper and stomach sleeper. It feels quite firm. I like sleep by side. I have to buy another mattress topper for this.,3

 soft. the pictures here were taken right after i got the bed out of the box.",4
7/14/2014,"I purchased this mattress in August of 2011 and paid $209 for the queen size plus $70 shipping as free shipping was not available on the item at the time (hence my 4/5 rating on value, seeing as it would be around $100 cheaper now then when I originally purchased the item).

The mattress is one of the most comfortable mattresses I have had and I received major compliments on the cloud like feel. I was a bit apprehensive to order a mattress-in-a-box and was definitely hard to explain it to friends and family that the bed literally inflated upon arrival.

In or around December of 2013 I too began to experience the sinking in the mattress. After months of uncomfortable rest I was tempted to buy a new mattress. I was going to buy the same exact...",4
4/17/2020,"The mattress is excellent for the price. It was easy to setup and the quality looks good. Note that the mattress is extra firm, so if you lay flat all night, you will ""feel"" it in the morning, but nothing too bad, especially considering the price. Mattress prices are ridiculous so if you're looking for something of good quality and inexpensive, you won't be disappointed.

I've had to deduct the 1 star because Walmart's packaging was disastrous. I was surprised to see the mattress wasn't damaged. The packaging was torn in multiple places as if rats as eaten through it.",4
3/23/2021,I bought this because one it was affordable. And 2 its just a temp for now. My son loves it. And im hoping my twins do as well. It cane in a box and soon as i unwrapped it. It open real quick. With plastic on to protect it. Very happy for my purchase. Why i gave it 4 stars? Only slight issue is it had a tiny space between the mattees and the bed. Which isnt a big deal but I would rather it fit perfectly,4
6/20/2021,"I give This mattress four ⭐ because I will buy it again for a child. The side holds up well to adult weight. But laying on it I can hear the springs popping, like it's busting out of the wrappings. The quilted material is a stain magnet. I spill a little tea on the mattress, thaugh I had wipe it clean , tea stain came back, bigger.",4
1/19/2014,"This mattress is easy to carry if you need to pick it up at the store. It comes in a box that although it does not fit into the trunk of the average car, it will fit nicely into a minivan without even removing the seats. Once you get it, gather the family around the bedroom, and let them watch the show as it comes out of the box rolled up like a tamale and becomes a full fledge mattress. A good mattress. I recommend it.",4
12/3/2023,The mattress is very comfortable and looks well made. It is almost perfect but unfortunately there is a yellow stain on top that became visible after opening the mattress.,4
3/28/2021,good product for the price.  I've had this mattress for 11 months and it's comfortable. However when it arrived I removed the mattress from the box it came in and there were scuff marks on the side  of the mattress.,4
7/15/2021,"Purchased based on other reviews. Nice firm support, for an 8 inch mattress. My son, 220,  is getting great nights of  sleep. I like the coils and foam combo. Free shipping, arrived within a few days. JB Chicago",4
12/13/2016,Twin Mattress unrolled quickly. Left it open over night. There was no smell by next morning. Has been used for 2  weeks now and is comfortable. Have just ordered another one to replace another old mattress.,4
6/6/2016,"For the price, you can't beat it. On the firm side and very comfortable. We needed a king size for a bed in the basement, so the box made it so much easier to get downstairs.",4
1/3/2017,I ordered two twin mattresses for captain platform beds. The fit perfect and my two boys age 2 and 4 have no problems sleeping - I actually napped a few times and mattress was surprisingly comfortable. I highly recommend,4
11/18/2022,"I think for the price you cannot beat the bed at all! I am not very hard to please though, and again the price was really good.
My discrepancy is more with the shipment company because they seem to have probably mishandled it before it got here and so it had a little indention on one side when expanding out but with time it kind of worked itself out for the most part.
So if you need a mattress for a guest room or you just need a new mattress for yourself and you're not wanting to pay much right now then pretty good deal for $120 a full size.",4
9/12/2016,"So far the mattress is good price, thick and nice.  But not on the firm side, so i gave it four stars.",4
8/28/2016,"Excellent mattress, it comes in a box and when you open it expands out. Wonderful.",4
7/21/2023,Got for my man and he loved  it just want it to be more fluffy.,4
7/21/2021,I ordered a full size. The shipping was delayed so  it took over a week to deliver.  The bed was comfortable and good enough. I would  recommend for guest room or kids/teenagers.,4

I am 7 months pregnant with back pain and my husband has back pain, we've only had this a week and it feels OK, but very firm. However, I hear firm is better for back pain. We bought a fluffy $65 down mattress cover and I think that will help a lot. You can't beat this price though.",4

As soon as I pulled it out of the box it started to inflate, once I took off the tape holding it tight it just popped open! Moved it into position and was able to sit on it right away, after 6hours we were able to enjoy it for bed and couldn't of been happier! We were in search of an affordable mattress since we didn't/don't have a ton to toss into a mattress right now with 3 kids and having just moved, after reading all the reviews we decided to give this one a try and it was worth it! So far it's wonderful, we are actually getting a full night of sleep vs what we were getting on t...",4
5/24/2011,"My children needed a full mattress for a bunk bed that we also purchased from Wal-Mart. We all were a little skeptical because it came in a box, but it worked out really nicely. Be sure to put it where you would like it before unwrapping it because it's easier to move in the box. It takes about 20 min to fill out and be comfortable. It is a little soft, but is a great buy in comparison to other mattresses this thick. Give it a try, you'll enjoy the rest!!",4
5/3/2011,"I was really surprised when I saw the package it came in I was wondering ""Is this a Queen size Mattress, impossible?"" but when I took it home and after assembling the frame to put it on, I was very amazed of how vacuum packed it was and of course how it expanded once the wrapping was removed. For my use this is a very comfortable buy and sleeps excellent for the money you have paid. I recommend this mattress for anyone just starting out or as an second bed for the house.",4
3/13/2013,"Ok first I have to say that it took a little over week for my order arrive to my local store which is about 5 minutes from my house. With that said, I have to say I was a little skeptical like many other customers were, but after reading all the positive reviews I finally decided to get it. When I got to the store I saw how big the box was and was like OMG how am I gonna get that in my car! I purchased the Queen size mattress in the box plus the metal frames so I had two huge boxes. I did manage to get both of them in my car thanks to the Walmart employee who was very nice. My husband and I managed to get it up to our third floor Townhome as it was a little heavy. We cut the tape around it off and there is goes starting to inflate. I was SH...",4
4/13/2017,"I recently moved and needed a new bed  so I ordered the queen size. It was really easy to inflate and has not deflated since I started sleeping on it a month ago. I will agree with one of the previous reviews that it is a little bit too firm. Luckily, I had a gel soft foam eggshell type deal that I put on top, flat side up. It's the perfect mix of having a firm foundation with the perfect amount of softness to it. My boyfriend says it's the most comfortable Matress he has slept on even more than his own bed. It's a good deal for what you get! Frame also bought from Walmart.",4

Positives

Price: I paid $99 + $6 tax for a total of $105. I replaced a popular name-brand mattress whose current (9/1/2017) advertised price is $652.

Free shipping.

Shopping convenience: No having to shop in retail stores.

Delivery convenience: No hassling with transporting the mattress, paying for delivery, or even having to be home when it is delivered. The box was left standing beside my front door.

No strong odor. I am sensitive to strong odors and was pleased that the mattress didn't stink.

Silent. On m...",4
1/6/2024,I got this for my daughter when we upgraded her bed size. It arrived super fast and packaged perfectly. It didn't take long to fill out once out of the plastic and she says it's the best sleep she had had in a long time. Her little brother even has been sneaking into her bed to lay on it.,4
1/6/2021,Seems like a good product since my kids like to be bouncy and it seems to be comfy my daughter likes it shes 10,4

3/25/2014,"Day 2.. So far so good! Mattress expanded in 10 min or so, it reached more that the size I ordered (8""), see pictures. Mattress is firm but comfortable, design on it looks good. I'll make an update 6 months later. Got questions?, ask me!",4
5/10/2016,We are so surprised at how comfortable this bed is. We bought it for our 16 year old son and he loves it. It comes rolled up in a box and quickly springs to life after unrolling. Amazing!,4

It arrived via site-to-store very quickly. It was rolled up and vacuum-packed in a box (roughly 60lbs; the box was able to fit into my sedan). It was easy to open and get set up on my bed frame by myself. It didn't really have any noticeable odor unless you put your face right up against it. I let it air out for several hours, but the instructions recommend letting it fully expand for 48 hours. However, seeing as I had nowhere else to sleep, I slept on it that night. It was ""fluffy"" enough at...",4
6/27/2016,"Wow, I love this mattress! I was very reluctant to purchase it but I only wanted it for a spare bedroom. I loved it so much I got a second one for my own bed! I have not been bothered with my every morning back ache since I've been sleeping on this mattress! Very surprised at the size of the box it arrives in but I opened it and let it set for 2 days and it is perfect, no smell at all and nice and firm. Love it! Definitely a great buy!",4
9/26/2016,"After reading through many reviews I decided to get this for my 10 yr old son who complains that his old mattress was just not comfortable anymore . Being 2-3 times more expensive no less. It came packaged perfectly, easy to open and set up. I let it set for a day before use . Kids both agreed it's much more comfortable and even I slept in it over the wknd. A definite must if you need a new affordable mattress.",4
10/9/2016,"The mattress arrived on time and was easily maneuvered  upstairs and atop the bunk bed.  My grandson was anxious to sleep on it that night so 4 hours to ""reboot"" was all the time we gave the mattress.  Plenty of time for the air to ""fill"" the mattress back up.  No fumes, everything was fine.  The 12 year old twin boys take turns sleeping on it, and are comfortable.  I climbed up there and found the mattress to be quite comfortable.   Pleasantly surprised in the comfort  as I really was just filling a void.  I had just purchased the bunk ( from Walmart) and needed the twin mattress.  I'm considering replacing the bottom ( full size) mattress with one from this same manufacturer.",4

We had ordered a twin size slumber 1 mattress also 8"" about 2 years ago and we couldn't be happier with it.",4
9/17/2016,"I have the same mattress for all members of my family. It's nice and cheap and we get a good nights sleep on it too. I like the fact that it comes in a box so I can choose to collect from store without worrying if it will fit in the car or not. The only downside is that you can not turn the mattress over every couple of months as you are supposed to because only one side has cushioning enough to sleep on. You could just rotate it so it doesn't wear in one place though, that would work.",4
8/22/2023,"Very comfy, perfect balanced between firm and soft. 8"" really is enough unless you want that ultra soft sinking feeling. The only thing is that there's no edge support so you don't want to sleep too close to the edges, but it's good for the $125 price. (Also please buy a queen size bed if you are over 5'11"", my feet are always hanging outside of the bottom edge, I really regret saving that $50 and it's too frustrating to return a mattress so I'll just have to sleep diagonally...)",4
3/15/2017,"I purchased a king size mattress-in-a-box and give it high marks. It was exactly as advertised and an excellent alternative to much higher priced mattresses. I wanted an economical mattress as I planned to cover it with 4"" memory foam. The combination is better, imo, than a mattress costing 10x as much. Don't be afraid of buying one of these coil spring mattresses from Walmart, they are an excellent option. The delivery took longer than 2 days, as advertised, and they apologized and issued to me a 5$ voucher. And shipping was free! I would recommend this mattress to friends and would purchase one again!",4
1/27/2012,"Very pleased with this mattress. just as comfy as one of those high end brands.

I, however, was mislead to believe that with this mattress, a boxspring was not needed. I have a small metal bed frame that I brought to college with me and picked up the mattress after I moved into my new apartment. After putting the frame together, I put the mattress on the frame and the mattress fell right through the frame. The whole reason for me buying the mattress was so that I didn't have to buy a boxspring.

Overall, the mattress sleeps great, even just with it on the floor.",4
11/17/2016,"I read almost half of all the reviews on this mattress before I purchased it. I liked that most people thought it was a great value for the price and offered ""solid"" body support. I agree, however it should be noted that as a previous reviewer said, ""the edges of the mattress have more give"" than a standard mattress. That means if you do a lot of sitting on the edges of this mattress you will sink down quite a bit. If that's not a big deal to you than this mattress is one of the best deals around!! Before I purchased this mattress I suffered from terrible back aches (so bad that sometimes I would have to go sleep on the couch to get a good night of sleep). I haven't had a single back issue since I started sleeping on this mattress-it's been...",4
10/5/2016,"The size (approximately 3 to 4 feet in length and two in width is my guesstimate) made carrying the box a little awkward but my 14 year old son managed to get it from the car into the house with only one pause to make an adjustment (he mentioned if the box had handles it would have been much better.)

Upon opening the box we were amazed at how well vacuum-packed it was.  Essentially it was folded in half and then rolled up.  After marveling at it for a bit we opened it up and watched as it began to inflate.  In the whole opening ceremony my kids lost the paperwork/instructions so I took the advice of the friend who had recommended it to us and let it expand for 3 full days. We just set it up last night and last night was its first sleep.

The mattress itself is comfortable for me. It is  very firm, so if you need more give  I would suggest getting a  thick mattress topper.  I didn't notice  any odor when it was unrolled.  I let it reinflate for 24 hrs.,  but it only got to 6 inches  instead of the 8 inches.  Not a big deal for me.  It sleeps comfortable,  and finally my feet don't hang off the end of the bed!
So far I am  satisfied.",4

I would recommend it to anyone to get a 10"" or 12"" thick unless you have a box spring to support it. I got a minimum thickness of 8"" (actual thickness is less) but not as good on a slat bed support. I recommend 10"" or 12"" on a slat bed support.",4

He's 22 now and at an adult weight so his back was bothering him due to the rut. I looked at regular mattresses and they were way out of my budget. I decided to look at Wal Mart and found this for around $200.00. When it arrived in that small box I said, oh no, what have I done. We opened it up and poof, it immediately expanded to a normal size - so crazy! First he said he loved it, then he hated it. I told him to give it time as he had been sleeping in a rut on the old mattress and this new one was firm. Next day, I asked again.....he said he absolutely loved it! I did however j...",4

So I sold the full and bought the queen and I couldn't be happier. However this time around it looks like the mattress wasn't made with the same materials. This latest version doesn't have the satin finish like the original one I had. The material is more of a full cotton, almost plush tissue-like material. Still equally as soft but not expected. The only complaint I had with this mattress was that it came with a stain on it. The stain was negligible however enough to annoy me. After opening the product however I didn't feel like having to troubleshoot how to ship it b...",4
9/26/2014,This mattress is what I was looking for (a regular size mattress) with comfort. With this mattress coming in a box is one great surprise; follow the instructions and you'll have one great mattress to full form in about a day. I have had this mattress under a month; molds to one's body and bounces back...no sagging of any kind and I am over 300 lbs. Very firm and I have appreciated the full nights of sound sleep. The mattress is used on my new Premiere Bow Flex Bed Frame. I'm happy thus far. And there is a great warranty.,4

So I took a chance and bought it with the Spa Sensations steel Smart base bed frame.   It arrived within the week.  I could not believe the mattress fit in the box.  I was a bit scared it would be damaged.   To my surprise it turns out the mattress was well wrapped and unrolled perfectly fine.

Ever since he has been taking multiple naps during the day, and enjoying the feel of it....",4
2/8/2024,"Very comfy and you get a good night rest on it. It's for my 6 year olds room, but I have napped on the mattress best naps ever !",4
11/4/2023,Not the best mattress in the world but it is definitely worth the price and it is comfortable. This is my second time buying the mattress with the first one lasting 5 years.,4
11/17/2023,"Mattress topper fit perfectly on my bed. it adds extra softness that I wanted. Only negative is when you sink in it's really hard to change positions, a indentation stays for a while?",4
12/17/2023,"we bought this for our daughter's new bed and its very comfortable for her, however,  no regular sheets fit it. the lenth is ok but the depth is weird and the sheets sit loosely.",4
12/18/2023,Very pleased with this mattress for the price. Bought for my son %26 he loves it. Followed instructions %26 waited 3 days for it to complete regain it's shape before using it. Just bought another one for my daughter.,4
11/17/2023,Good quality only complaint was the price apparently changed between putting it in my cart and paying so I paid more but my fault for not triple checking,4
10/28/2023,the only thing I think that could make it a better mattress for the value would be a little thicker topper on the mattress other than that I'm really pleased with it.,4
10/29/2023,"Unpacking was smooth. Definable serve the purpose. I like firm bed and this is exactly as I expected. Product is HEAVY, hence difficult at times whenever you will need to move it, can be moved by one person though.",4
1/8/2024,"The mattress is comfortable, easy to maneuver around and the delivery was very quick. When house is rebuilt will buy several more for bedrooms.",4
1/1/2024,"Great mattress for the price. I got this for my son, the last one I bought lasted about 2 1/2 years.",4
8/31/2023,The mattress arrived on time.  It was easy to unravel the plastic around the mattress and it sprang right up.  So far my son has loved it.  He seemed to sleep better also.,4
4/18/2013,"I decided to order this matress due to prior usage . It is a good mattress; I do not have backaches after a night sleeping on it. Overall, it is a very good value . I have reccommend this to several people.",4
9/20/2023,Pretty comfortable for the price. It is more on the firm side and you do not sink into the bed like a memory foam mattress which is nice. Set up was easy and shipping was fast,4
2/2/2017,"easy to handle and move it came rolled up in half  one person can move it .It looked like it was a twin size ,but when it was undone it was what I had ordered a KING SIZE!!!",4
9/10/2023,The box was delivered with a little damage but the mattress so far has been amazing. We waited 24 hours to ensure it was completely inflated. So far my son is enjoying his full size mattress.,4
9/5/2023,"I like it very much.  It did not smell, as I was warned.  I left it alone for 3 days to rise.   I'm a big woman (240 lbs) and this 8"" mattress supports my greatness.  Quite comfortable.",4
8/18/2014,It only expanded to 7 inches but it's very comfortable. The smell doesn't bother me but if you're sensitive to smells it might be a problem. It can handle my weight just fine (250 lbs.).,4
6/22/2023,"Overall this mattress is moderately softer than the Zinus 12” tea tree mattress we have. Since my weight is 160lbs it is functional and comfortable. However, if you are a heavy person this mattress most likely would be to soft. Sitting on the edge of the mattress flattens the mattress and has difficulty supporting my weight. I will use this mattress but I would recommend the natural tea tree mattress which is about $70 more. This mattress has coil spring whereas, the tea tree does not. The mattress fully expanded to 8” in 48 hours. This mattress would be perfect for children.",4
3/19/2023,I purchased this mattress three years ago for my oldest. It's a good mattress and lasts. This is why I purchased it again. It's firm and opens up fully out the box. No flat spots. Only reason I took a star off is because the bed is very bouncy. Other than that a good quality mattress that I got at a good price. True twin size by the way. Fits any standard twin size bed frame.,4
1/26/2024,"The mattress was of good quality and comfort, i will buy it again.",4
2/5/2024,Vacuum seal package is great and overall comfortable just a little hard,4
2/14/2024,Cover was okay but was not as fluffy and soft as I hoped,4
8/8/2016,"I bot the 8"" firm mattress because I only had 2 choices:  soft or firm.  I would have rather had a medium firmness with more cushion as this mattress is a little hard.  The firmness is fine, but there isn't enough padding to make it comfortable for the bones.",4
4/29/2020,"Only have been sleeping on it for about 2 weeks, but so far it's great.  I mean, you get what you pay for, so it's not the *best* mattress I've ever slept on, but with a good eggcrate and  liner, it's miles more comfortable than my 10 year old Serta! Setting it up was super easy, and I have no boxspring, just the metal frame usner the mattress.  No complaints!",4
1/20/2013,"I was very afraid to spend such a cheap amount for a mattress but I read all the reviews and found everybody liked it so I took a chance to buy it because I desperately needed a new mattress because I was waking up feeling miserable with aches and pains everywhere. Well to my surprise the first morning I woke up I was like "" wow I sure feel different ."" It is worth the money!",4
7/24/2014,"Just picked up the bed from my store on 7/22/14. The Site to Store option is always the best because I'm not always home to ship to house. The bed was presented to me in a box, which was a little concerning. When I got home and cut open the box, you can see that the bed basically looks like it has been vacuum sealed into a really larger plastic bag. Once you break the plastic, you immediately here the bed start to suck in air, lol. It started to inflate into a full size twin bed instantly. Within 5 mins of removing its packaging, we had it on the floor and my boyfriend who is 6' and 240lbs, laid on it and complemented on how comfortable it was. He continued to lay on it for the next 3hrs while watching a movie to ensure it was going to be g...",4
5/19/2013,"I was truly amaze to watch this mattress inflate let a blowup bed ,but it was full size mattress that was very comfortable but very firm. In next 48 hours the mattress was up to it's full size and even more comfortable. I was even more impress on how it was pack for delivery the box fit in the rear of car.",4
7/14/2016,"The mattress came one day later than expected, but other than that everything was as stated. It came in a box rolled up.  I unwrapped it as instructed and it took about 24 hours for it to reach 8"".  It was a little softer than I would like, but my 4 year old is sleeping on it and it seems to be fine for him.",4
11/4/2016,"bought for a teenager,twin size used on a platform. It is a bit firm but not like a rock. it has enough ""give"" to be comfy  but you won't sink to the bottom like a cloud. haven't had any complaints  and he seems well rested. We also have a queen size on a platform have had for 3 years  with two people sleeping on it one over 200lbs one just under and it is holding up well. we have a thin topper on that one (not memory foam) I expect at around the 5 year mark we may get another to replace the queen. cost and value are nice.",4
6/20/2016,"I only have this item in use for two days. So far the mattress feel comfortable and provides a respectable quality for the money.  This is not a top of the line mattress for a daily use, but it will serve us well for our guest room.
Will provide another update in a few months to see how the mattress performs after multiple uses.",4
5/25/2013,"Much better than I expected for the price, a real value. I bought this in a queen size for my guest bedroom and tried it last night. It's very comfortable. I don't know how it will hold up, but it will not be used that often. Surprising that it was delivered rolled up, and expanded to full size after a few hours.",4
11/7/2023,"For the price it was definitely a good buy! Although I think if I order again, I will get a thicker mattress.",4
11/10/2023,"For the price it's not bad . A spring mattress that's not stiff hard ,  it's great for a starter mattress if you're just trying to get things going .",4
1/5/2024,Very comfortable and a great bed for our truck camper.,4
1/4/2024,"bed is great, not too soft and feels pretty sturdy.",4
1/2/2024,"great price, fast shipping,  comfortable to lay and sleep",4
1/7/2024,"easy shipping /delivery,  good support for 180lb guy and company....",4
1/16/2024,Seems to breakdown when used daily. Might want to spend another $100 unless used sparingly,4
12/26/2023,Comfortable for my kids bunk beds,4
1/10/2024,it's a little too firm for me but I will solve with a pillow topper.,4
10/3/2023,"I purchased 2 of these.  One for my camper and the other for my daughter, very comfortable and great price.",4
10/23/2023,Nice and firm. Was able to sleep without back pain. Low profile. You can kind of feel the springs but could always just add a topper.,4
8/24/2023,it came as stated. inflated to be a firm mattress. i havent had it long enough to know if its durable or will last,4
3/27/2023,I like this mattress the look of it is really nice and I love the firmness I wish it was a little thicker but the price is what I wanted so I like it. I've purchased this mattress twice now for two different beds so yes  that means I do like it,4
11/25/2023,It will get the job done. It is a little firmer than I would like but overall ok.,4
12/2/2023,"Mattress a lttle to hard, but everything else is great",4
11/25/2023,this mattress was perfect for our guest bedroom,4
12/22/2023,Good bed add a pillow top and enjoy,4
11/4/2023,"The mattress firm and heavy. It's great, I got it on sale.",4
11/18/2023,got this mattress for my 13 year old. he has no complaints.,4
12/20/2023,my children loved em said they are very comfortable I purchased a queen and queen,4
12/24/2023,The height and firmness are nice,4
11/8/2023,The mattress is comfortable. Just remember 8 inches is a lot smaller than you think.,4
9/25/2016,"very easy set up.  came up to size very quickly.  wish the sides were just a bit stronger,  you notice it when you sit on the side of the bed to put your socks on.",4
2/22/2017,"My mattress in a box was delivered within two business days, no shipping charge. It was easy to remove from the packaging and was ready to use that night. Much more convenient and less expensive than a mattress store.",4
7/31/2019,"I have been sleeping on this mattress for about a week now and I have to say that it is comfortable! There weren't any weird smells lingering and it inflated to the full 8"" all the way across the mattress. As a 5'10 women (roughly 150lbs) I was able to get it out if the box, out of the plastic, and onto my bed frame within 15 minutes.

Cons: 
- There were not any instructions provided on how to decompress the mattress or how long to let it sit before using 
- It has a long yellow stain in the corner of the it",4
11/9/2019,"The idea of a getting a rolled-up compressed spring mattress delivered in a box made me skeptical, but I took a chance and I'm surprisingly pleased thus far.  (I don't know how well the mattress will hold up over time, but so far, so good.)  There is a warning that the mattress is ""under a lot of pressure lately"" and to be cautious when releasing it, but the mattress made a noiseless smooth transition within a matter of seconds.  I was actually amazed over what I saw transpire as well as what I did not see but obviously had occurred.  The mattress appeared to be fully inflated and ready to use, but I followed the instructions and let it set(tle) for 48 hours on the floor.  I'd say that the mattress is reasonably priced, of at least satisfac...",4
12/28/2012,"I went from a 10 year old $900 king size mattress to this bed-in-a-box. It was pretty much what I expected. It's comfy, but thin and the edges drop. When you sit at the end or side of the bed, you kind of slide down because there's little support around the outside of the mattress. It was easy to install and would be good for a guest bed, but I'm sure I'll be purchasing a ""real"" supportive mattress within the year.",4
12/29/2016,"So, my 4 & 5 year olds were ready for regular beds. These were the Best plan for my family for the money! We already had frames, but new mattresses locally were just out of our reach financially. Other than a minor shipping glitch which, may have been my own fault, everything else went perfectly! They set up in minutes, I let them ""settle for 72 hours, just to be sure, & VIOLA! New beds for my kids. They are both VERY HAPPY, which makes me happy! THANKS WALMART!",4
9/12/2013,"I bought this to go with a platform bed, and because shipping was a lot less hassle that wrestling a mattress up the freight elevator to my apartment and it arrived when expected.

When I opened the box the first thing I thought was: this is a mistake. How are you going to fold this thing back up and lug it to the store? Even though it expanded as promised, I was still skeptical.

I let it breathe for the recommended time. When I did sleep on it, I was amazed. I kept waiting for it to collapse but no, I slept like a baby. I don't know who this mattress would not work for, but it works great for me. I'd buy another without thinking twice.",4
4/2/2013,I purchased this mattress for my sons first big boy bed. It does come in a box. I did have it delivered and they left it on my step. I had no problems moving it myself (single mom). The mattress does expand a great deal after you open it up and gets firmer within one day. I would not get this for a grown person or very heavy child. It is a great starter mattress for a little one. My son loves it and sleeps very well.,4
10/31/2016,Received it quickly in a box as advertised. Opened easily and took on the shape and size as per the description. It fit perfectly into the twin platform bed I purchased and it appears to be very comfortable. I guess time will tell about durability but appears sturdy enough for an adult sleeper. This one is in my guest room so will be used few weeks at a time on and off. Very pleased with it so far. Didn't give it 5 stars since not sure about the wear.,4
1/29/2013,"I bought this mattress for my 4 yr olds new captains bed. It's so comfy. My husband and daughter have taken turns sleeping on it and they both want it. My husband said that he woke up without back pain in a long time after sleeping one night on this bed. I will be purchasing two more for my daughters.

I didn't give 5 stars because we've had it only for a week so I'm not sure how it will be three months down the line.

Shipping was super fast....I received it maybe three days after I ordered it. It comes rolled up in a box....vacuum sealed. Once you open the plastic up just a big, the air rushes in and mattress expands in seconds. So far we love it.",4
1/31/2013,I have multiple orthopaedic problems and arthritis as well as fibromyalgia. This mattress is wonderful. I dont wake up feeling like I' ve been in a cage fight each morning. I've only had it for a short time but so far I've already got my moneys worth in sleep. The one con is; it is difficult to lift unless you have help.,4
10/18/2016,"Mattress arrived in comparatively small box .  Packaging opened fairly easily and
mattress expanded relatively quickly to 8.5 inches.  It is a nice looking mattress
and fairly comfortable.  It is not as firm as I expected and you do tend to sink into it a little more than I like.   The other thing that I noted is in spite of the claims for having firm edge support, in reality the edges have very little support.  I definitely prefer having firmer edges on a mattress.  Overall, I find the mattress to be fairly comfortable but will know more after a few months of sleeping on it.",4
3/30/2013,"Too good to be true? It's not! I was skeptical that a mattress-in-a-box would be a poor choice, but I was surprised when I slept on it. It's firm, but not too hard. It also is much more comfortable than I would have imagined it to be.

It arrives in a box that can be carried/handled by one person. It is a bit heavy and awkward when you unwrap it, but it positions easily. Once the sheets were on it, it was ready to go. It took about two days to fully ""puff up"", but it was comfortable right out of the box. The edges are a bit soft, so don't sleep on the edge.

I'm pleasantly surprised how comfortable this mattress is (I spent most of the day in bed simply relaxing).",4
5/5/2014,"Overall, a very good value. If using/buying for permanent/primary mattress, I prob wouldn't recommend if you were heavier set, say maybe 250lbs or more. The springs are not as heavy gauge so it could affect the comfort levels, and you can also feel them on the edges. I'm 6' 2"" and it feels really good to me. Def not a high end mattress, but a great value for spare/guest bedroom(for non-heavy guests imo lols) which is what we bought this for. Easy ordering and delivery. Weighs about 60lbs or so. Easy unpacking, but let it ""air out"" for a day or so for it to fully expand before sleeping on it.",4
4/15/2014,I bought this matress for my son. He loves it and says it is so nice to sleep on. He is happy that he does not feel the springs any more like he did in his old bed. Mind you he is 8 years old but has not slept well through the nights until getting him this new mattress. So far very pleased with this and would recommed it.,4
3/4/2014,"The box was huge but not so far out in weight that I couldn't have lifted it myself. But for safety, a friend helped lift it onto the box spring. From there it was simple to remove the box and plastic covers. My friend had to leave but moving it around on the box spring was easy. Very light compared to an actual clothe mattress. It expanded in moments and I laid on it to nap - without blankets or sheets it was superb. Later when time to go to bed for the night with sheets and blankets - I slept like a baby - or so they say that is what it was like. I have been sleeping on everything but a bed for about a year and my body fell in love with this mattress. I sleep deeply and comfortably for a few hours at a time and wake up feeling wonderful. ...",4
3/8/2013,"mattress arrived rolled up in a small box, shrink wrapped and our first reaction was we really don't want this. But when the plastic was punctured, air immediiately filled the mattress up. It is surprisingly sturdy and very, very comfy. Used for small kids on a bunk bed and don't expect it to last for many years, but right now its perfect. pretty cool technology.",4
2/24/2017,"The product picture makes it look almost ""pillow top"" like, but it is not, at all.  Very very flat mattress.  Pretty firm.  Would not recommend for an adult regular nights sleep.  I use for my 10 yr old daughter regularly.   Can be used for a guest mattress or child's mattress.",4
2/21/2014,"The mattress comes in a box that 2 people can carry. Does exactly like video. Open the box, cut the plastic off and wala you have a perfect mattress. I didnt have anyone sleep on it for 48 hours as per instructions.

The mattress is firm. I would like the sides a little more firmer because thats the way you get out and that usually goes first on a mattress.

The mattress is great for anyone who lives in a dorm, apartment or who doesnt want to pay the extra charge to have a mattress delivered. This mattress is just as good as any bed store place.",4
6/5/2016,"This is a great mattress for the price. 
If you want a firm mattress this isn't for you. I loved it but my husband has back issues and has to sleep on a firm mattress , so he tried it one night and had to go back to his firm mattress.
If you don't have back issues, then you will love it!",4
10/12/2016,"Nice firm mattress. As with anything, your body has to adjust to something new, especially something your body rests on for 7-8 hrs. My first two nights had my body a little whacked out, back was achy. I've had it a week now and my last several nights I have been sleeping like a baby! Decent mattress for the $$",4
3/15/2013,"Was I surprised when a relatively small box arrived. I was expecting this good sized cardboard box... I did order a full size mattress. But it had been compressed, rolled, and vacuum sealed, then wrapped again and taped. As soon as I punctured the sealed plastic wrapper... the mattress unfolded into a regular sized full size mattress. Very cool! Good mattress... 8"" thick and very comfortable. Good deal if you ask me!",4
8/12/2016,"I was looking for something cheap but decent to replace mine in a pinch, and this is surprisingly comfortable and durable for the price. I would highly recommend this for a guest room or even for a first ""big boy/girl"" bed. It set-up quickly, and was ready to nap in fifteen minutes after it arrived!",4
5/1/2014,"I like the mattress overall, especially for the price but I can feel some springs poking here and there. I just have to adjust myself and its fine. If you have the money, spend it on a better mattress. I myself am on a very tight budget so this will do.",4
3/18/2014,"Great mattress! I was surprised how quickly the order came to our home as well as the small box size for a large mattress. Once opened, the mattress began filling up to become a full size mattress in no time. The mattress is extremely comfortable - it is moderately firm (not too soft and not too firm - just perfect). This is a great mattress for the price!",4
9/7/2013,"I ordered the queen size and it came in a box that was easy to fit in my focus back seat. Unboxing was as simple as most say unfold the mattress then remove plastic, it fluffs up in a few mins and was almost full size within a hr. The mattress is not as soft as some claim I would put it more on the firm side. I've had no problems sleeping on it and zero back pains.",4
3/5/2013,I recently bought this mattress for my 3 year old daughter to sleep on. I went from having her sleep with me for a few weeks to having my bed back again! I found out her old bed was really uncomfortable for her to sleep on. Assembly was very easy and took less than a half hour for me to actually get it set up in her room. I used the Smart base foundation that made it to where you didn't need a box spring for the mattress. Overall if you are thinking about upgrading your bed for your kids this will suit just perfectly for them!,4
3/31/2014,We have been using this for less than a week now..It came fast..surprisingly no smell... (I am sensitive to smells) opened quickly and looked quite ready for a good nights sleep the same day..although we waited for suggested 48 hours before we started using it.,4
12/10/2016,I thought it was going to be a cheap springy bed. But its thick and super comfortable. Several people that have stayed over to use the bed ask me where I got it since its so comfortable. When i say it came from Walmart and in a box they're fully amazed. Awesome Deal!,4
7/25/2016,This mattress was exactly as shown on the website.  I followed directions and the mattress inflated to full 8 inches in 24 hours.  It's very comfortable and has improved my sleep.  I gave 4 stars because I don't know how it will hold up over time even though it has a 10 year warranty.    So far I am satisfied with this product.  It is well worth the price.,4
10/20/2016,"I have had this bed for a couple of weeks now. I will update if anything goes wrong.
But so far I've been very happy within my purchase.
I had it delivered to the store and it arrived four days early!!!
I took it home and opened it and it inflated almost instantly to the full size!!!!
It is a solid mattress and a little on the firm side (which is what I wanted).
I have slept on this mattress every night for two weeks and i am very happy. So far I cannot feel any springs or coils. It is a little on the firm side but definitely supports you. 
I am 5'4 and about 200lbs. I have had problems with mattresses sinking in the middle due to my weight. This holds up and I don't wake it feeling like I've sunk in a hole.
Overall, I am very happy. I have...",4
7/12/2016,"The shipping was quick and the box came in good shape. The mattress expanded after taking it out. It is quite a comfortable mattress according to my 8 yr old grand daughter. Time will tell how well it hold up but it seems like a great bargain. You will need support under the mattress, either a bunkie board, platform or plywood.",4
6/16/2016,I was thrown off when the queen sized mattress arrived in this small box.  Once I opened it and it inflated it was awesome!!  I bought for my son who is going to college and he is very happy with the mattress and he says that it is very comfortable.  Don't let the box that it arrives in throw you off.  It takes 2 days for it to inflate completely and once it does it is a regular mattress.,4
11/12/2013,"This mattress arrived rather quickly. When I saw the big box I was a bit skeptical. Upon opening the box I thought it would never work. But then I removed it from the box and cut the tape that was binding it, and Voila!! I had a king size mattress!! And it is pretty darn comfortable! I am not having problems adjusting to it and sleep well on it. Make sure when you open it that you are near your bed frame, because this thing opens up fast! The price was awesome. No complaints from me!",4
8/3/2013,I didn't think it would come in a box better yet rolled up and deflated. It is actually quite comfortable and firm so much that my back doesn't hurt when I get up in the morning. I would definitely recommend this mattress to everyone. But the coolest part was when I opened the box and seen it was a mattress.,4
2/20/2014,"It's not a bad mattress if you consider that you're paying 1/3 of what you would pay elsewhere. I got the full size for my daughter's bed. She's 7 years old and this mattress is good for her. It came tightly wrapped up and once you open up all the wrappings, it expanded to a mattress.

the mattress is much thinner than what you get elsewhere. The springs are also much bigger and you can definitely feel them if you're heavier. when I plop myself onto it, I can reach the bottom of the spring. That padding is a little on the thin side but is soft and comfy. Considering the price, this mattress is good.",4
5/26/2016,I was quite surprised that this was so easy- it expanded to full height and width in a short period of time.   They manufacturer should have the instruction to Inflate within 72 hours of receipt on the Outside of the box!  I actually waited about 3 weeks:).   And I did not wait 24 hrs to sleep on it.   But it was fine.  It's a little hard so for me needs a soft topper.   The only other issue is the printed material that comes with mentions customer service bit I saw no contact info anywhere and googling turned up nothing.,4
6/2/2016,"I was skeptical just everyone else about a mattress in a box but I""m satisfied I gave it a shot. The mattress came in a box and I wasn't convinced I got the right sized but it expanded to a queen right before my eyes.  I can feel the springs if I push down hard enough but hey, it's not a $1,000 product but for the price, it's perfect.",4
4/10/2014,"Bought for a guest room to be used a few times a year. I put it on a mattress frame (not box springs) and put a nice padded mattress cover on it to soften the feel a bit - I'd say the mattress is semi-firm. I tried it and thought the mattress was comfortable, but I don't know how it would hold up to nightly use for several years. It does not have the edge reinforcement a ""real"" mattress has (if it did, it wouldn't be boxable). For my needs, it's perfect.",4
7/24/2014,"If you purchase this mattress thinking your going to get a mattress comparable to one that retails for $500, you'll be sorely disappointed. If, however, you expect a $160 mattress, you might be pleasantly surprised. We purchased this for our 3 year old and it is perfect for that purpose. In his words, he loves his ""soft and cozy bed"". I have rested with him on the mattress and it IS very comfortable. This mattress lacks a few critical things to make it a high quality mattress: -When I push into the mattress with my fingers, I can feel and even hear the springs popping, however, I can not feel the springs when I lay on the mattress -The mattress does not have a ""frame"" so the edges don't stay rigid when you press down. When we carried this m...",4
2/16/2017,"Ordered the king size mattress in a box. I was worried it would be too thin on the bed but really bulked up to the full 8"". It is comfortable. The best part was it was delivered to my door and I was able to take it up stairs in the box (with help from my husband) and then open it up there. Our stairs have a sharp right angle so getting large things up and down is difficult. This was a great solve for cheaper than some of the other expandable beds.",4
8/22/2016,"This mattress is a good chioce for someone looking for a quick replacement and someone in a budget. Came in a large box and all you have to do is take it out and open the plastic packaging.

Only bas thing is that it takes about 10 to 14 days for delivery.",4
11/13/2013,"I purchased this for a friend that was in need of a new mattress but could not afford to replace. I thought it was a good value and easy to transport . The mattress was good quality and comfortable. I slept on it for 5 days, during the visit , and slept very well without any issues with my back pain.",4
3/6/2013,"This is working out pretty well for my 10 year old, but I would not purchase it for an adult, or anyone over, say, 150 pounds. As others have noted, the edges of the mattress have no support. The mattress is not as stiff as a traditional mattress typically is; however, my son is glad to have a full-size bed and you can't beat the price.",4
12/27/2013,"Lightweight, but it does open up just like the video shows. It is in a guest room, so it hasn't yet been used. I did lay on it for a couple of minutes, and it appears comfortable. The only problem, is that, because it is lightweight, it does slip around on the frame quite easily.",4
12/26/2013,"We let it expand for about 24 hours since we had never owned a mattress like this one. It's comfortable, but the sides and corners seem much more squishy than the center. I prefer firmer mattresses and this one does the job, just weird that the firmness isn't consistent all over.",4
11/25/2016,"Item took almost a week longer than original delivery date to arrive. Once it arrived it was very easy to remove from the box. It weighed quite a bit but it was still easily moved on to my bed frame by me alone. Instructions were easy to follow. Lay item where you wish to set it up, unroll and unfold it then carefully cut the bag and watch it inflate!",4
12/13/2013,"If you have kids make sure they're around when you set up this mattress; when you undo the wrap and tape the compressed mattress starts hissing and moving as it sucks up air... really cool to watch. Or, maybe, I just need to get out more. Anyway, compared next to a mattress I bought
at Sleepys at the same time, this ""mattress in a box"" ain't too shabby. I could have bought four of
these for what I paid for the one from Sleepys.",4
9/26/2016,Sleeps good & good for my bad back using without foundation !!,4
10/22/2023,"Love the fact that ot makes my bed higher. 
I dislike that its softer than what i was expected",4
9/16/2023,Nice %26 thick. Fits mattress well.,4
9/1/2023,it nice but its was purchased  for children  so it good for them semi firm.,4
10/23/2023,So far it's good and as I was expected.,4
10/21/2023,Great price. Comfortable and expanded quickly.,4
7/31/2023,Super comfortable love it.  I would buy it again.,4
8/17/2023,Mattress good not to soft or too hard. I'm between. Recommend to others.,4
9/17/2023,Free Shipping and received in 2 days. comfortable and firm mattress....i say it was a good buy!,4
9/18/2023,Great purchase at a great value,4
10/1/2023,"I actually like it, my son said that it's a bit soft and he will probably get a box spring",4
10/19/2023,"Easy delivery and set up. Purchased for Murphy guest bed, guests said it was great.",4
7/8/2023,Very impressed with the mattress. Seems to be very good value for the cost.,4
10/20/2023,It's ok for the reduced price,4
10/8/2023,Would recommend to everyone,4
10/12/2023,Good condition as expected!,4
10/22/2023,better than spending money over 100s or thousands of dollars on air matteress,4
10/20/2023,Very nice mattress I would recommend it I'm very satisfied!,4
8/2/2023,"i like the price and how comfortable it is, i don't like the packaging.",4
4/20/2023,It's pretty comfortable but it's not double sided like smoky mattresses and kinda bigger then I thought overall not to bad,4
11/4/2019,"Bought this for my son, came in the box compressed, the quality is good enough for this price, the only thing disappointed is it's not long enough for my twin bed, there's space on the edge.",4
11/30/2012,We just got it a week ago for my teenage daughter. its fine so far. I hope it wears well and stays firm. We didnt purchase a boxspring-were putting it on a platform bed.,4
6/22/2016,"Very attractive mattress top. No movement from partner is noticed. Soft but firm sleeping feel, slight center compression, good for all sleep positions.Using as a quest bed Guest said comfortable.",4
3/18/2017,Very inexpensive but very plush. The firmness is perfect for me. This was a mattress I brought for a temporary situation but I not be tossing this out because it is of very good quality.,4
8/1/2016,"We got this mattress for our 4 year old and was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable it is. 

It's nice and firm, yet soft enough for her to sleep (and jump!) on.",4
3/16/2013,"Just got the mattress last week. It's great, very comfy. Easy to get where you need it and set it up. My 14 year old did it herself. Can't really give anymore than that until we've had it awhile.",4
6/6/2013,I was amazed! The quality of this mattress is great and the relatively small box it came in made it so easy to move to our downstairs bedroom. Simply remove the packaging and it becomes a queen size mattress. My adult son loves it!,4
3/8/2013,"It very comfortable and easy to set up,my daughter loves it and is thrilled,we got it for her room,i couldnt believe how easy to set it up was, we love it.",4
12/24/2020,Delivered in a box is convenient. Waiting a couple of days for it to breathe into shape while sleeping on a air mattress was frustrating but worth it. Worth the money. Will suffice until times get better and premium bedding is in the budget.,4
6/26/2016,"Easy to setup, very comfortable and reasonable price. 


One thing to note is the width is about 2-4 inches less than the Queen size bed (compare to my old mattress and bed frame).",4
3/18/2013,"Great price. Was a little lumpy bud I put 2"" foam on top and it's perfect. It only took a couple of days to be delivered. If I move again I wont bother takeing it with me I'll just buy another.",4
11/1/2013,"I purchased this as a replacement to the Signature Sleep Contour twin size mattress, which was 3 inches shorter than the standard. The Slumber 1 was the correct size after full expansion. Very good.",4
4/19/2014,"My teenage son loves it. I slept on it myself and its definitely not like an expensive regular mattress...but I am impressed. It reminds me of a very good quality fold out couch mattress. I am probably buying another. Or possibly the10"".",4
8/9/2016,Only had it for a few days but teenager loves it. Said it's super soft and comfy. Came well packaged.  Only reason I'm not giving a five star is that we've only had it a week and I'm not sure how it holds up long term,4
6/30/2016,This was a purchase for our daughter who moved back home. She loves it. I don't suggest paying the extra $4.97 for speeder delivery though - it arrived 3 days past the date it was suppose to and one day before totally free shipping  :/,4
4/17/2013,"I had read the reviews for this mattress. They were true! The mattress is compressed and then when taken out of the box, it expands. It is comfortable, and a great buy for the price! I am exceptionally pleased!",4
3/29/2021,I was Leary of getting a mattress in a box at first but had some good reviews so I gave it a try. The mattress is amazing! I love it! Very soft and comfortable. Decent quality for the price.,4
4/13/2014,I bought 2 of these mattresses for our spare bedrooms. It was unbelievable how big and firm they got once we took them out of the box. Perfect for what we needed them for.,4
7/21/2016,I think this a very good mattress for your dollar. So happy with it. Actually this is the second one I have purchased in six months. I liked it so much I purchased another for my other queen bed. More than happy customer. Comfortable.,4
11/6/2016,A good mattress for the price and very convenient to be able to purchase online because  I really don't care for mattress shopping and think most mattresses are extremely overpriced.  This is a very comfortable mattress as well.,4
5/8/2014,I love this mattress! It's very comfortable and I sleep great with no back pain when I wake up. Would recommend it for a less expensive solution to a full bedding set.,4
10/3/2016,"I purchased this for a guest bedroom with a platform bed frame.  My guests say it is comfortable.  It is firm, but has a nice cushion on top.  It is a good bed for the price.",4
9/28/2016,"Nice price, good quality, a little heavy to move but the free deliver to home is pretty awesome!! 
Carefully read the instruction on the box before you get it out of the box. Watch out when open it.",4
10/30/2012,"Couldn't believe it came in such a small box, rolled up in a duffel bag, but after following the directions to oen it up the mattress became full size and is quite comfortable. we use this for our kids. Overall, it is a good value and anticipate it will serve its purpose well. As stated by a number of people, let it breath for a day or two. The delivery was also very quick. Enjoy",4
12/22/2013,"purchased for sons new bed. Was compeletly shocked when arrived home and saw a box that looked like it would hold a body pillow. I was thinking perhaps they messed up order and sent a mattress topper and not the mattress. Well, I was wrong. Twin size mattress bundled up tight and air sucked out. Watch out when you open make sure you have large open space. Mattress seems rather comfortable and firm. For price not bad at all. Just be aware that it comes in small box and you need room to open it - stand clear!",4
10/29/2012,"I literally looked at this mattress online for a week before purchasing. The price was right, but I just COULD NOT imagine a comfortable and quality mattress fitting in a box. I had the mattress shipped to my local store. I picked up the box (make sure you have help lifting it's small but heavy). I got the box home --- opened the packaging --- cut the tape wrapped around the mattress and literally almost like magic the mattress was sitting perfectly on top of the frame. The mattress is COMFORTABLE and of good quality. I've had a few friends stop by who were curious about ""bed in a box"" -- now I've got a few of my friends sold.

good price.
good mattress! I am satisfied.",4
2/24/2013,"The box is pretty heavy so you might want some help. In seconds it had taken its shape. The single mattress is great. If you are looking for a queen I would suggest to get it a few inches higher. The single looks great and is Very comfortable. The queen is less comfortable, cause of support I think. If buying for a child, daughter said it was a little to firm for her liking. Now she is okay with it though. Overall great product.",4
3/7/2017,"Good for the price to use for children. Bought for my 3 year old son's 1st big boy bed. Slightly firm, with just the right amount of bounce. Came packaged with a slight dirt stain near one of the ends of the mattress, but not major enough to make a fuss over.",4
7/8/2013,"We have used the same product for 3 years plus and again bought it in new apartment. We get free shipping at home and overall the quality is good for the price. I think if you're someone who can sleep on just any mattress, you should be fine but if you are very particular about sleep numbers etc you may like to shop further.",4
5/28/2021,"This is the second mattress I have purchased for my son. The first one got him through college. The second is when he moved into his own home. Just throw a mattress topper on it and he swears its the most comfortable mattress he has slept on. He prefers a more firm mattress. Had a hiccup with FedEx on delivery, however Walmart corrected and shipped another mattress via another carrier and it was delivered the next day.",4
12/20/2017,"nice mattress for the price, read all reviews and they are right,in the beginning have some lower back pain but now past almost a week it is much better, guess need to adapt to my body, it is firm, the way I like may be my body not so much, it was a great purchase the price very good, I happy with it, better than other old mattress mine in the past, so far not complain, the material l looks nice",4
3/13/2014,"Got it 2 weeks ago, came on a box and surprisingly expanded over 24 hrs. Material is very good and you literally don't feel any movement from the person next to you (heavy husband). A little softer than I would wanted, but overall very good value for the money.",4
5/17/2013,"We purchased 2 of these mattresses for a twin room in our shrt term rental property. They look the part and seem comfy enough but I only laid on them breifly. It's hard to buy something like this when you haven't had the chance to feel it or see it, not like buying a TV on line, but they seem nice enough. They arrived within the time frame and the box that they came in was small enough to get in the rental car so no worries about delivery. When we got them home they popped open very easily as soon as we removed the packaging, I recommend you remove the packaging with the mattress in the place where you want it to be. Overall seems to be a very good purchase. We won't be using the product ourselves it will be for the guests who rent the hous...",4
11/15/2013,"I bought it for my 4 year old and it's been just 2 weeks but she's loving it.
Even I slept on it occasionally while putting her to sleep and it feels comfy.
Hope it stays the same in the long run. Great value for money and shipped for free in a small carton(bed in a box concept).",4
7/16/2021,I ordered this full-size spring coil mattress for our cottage and had it delivered so it was there when we arrived.  It came in a box which was super convenient to haul inside and unwrap.  It instantly took shape.  It will only be used on accasion at a cottage and it is plenty comfortable for those times.  We are very pleased!,4
3/8/2013,"My daughter loves the mattress. I was worried at first cause the box it shipped in was small but the mattress worked out for us. The price is awesome. I was looking around for twin mattresses and they were ranging from $199 - over $1000, it was crazy. I am happy with the purchase.",4
9/9/2013,Bought this for my 3 yr. old son for his bunk bed. We used a bunky board underneath and it worked perfectly! I have laid on it and it is very comfortable. I was definately skeptical about the bed-in-a-box but the bed formed nicely once opened and I would totally recommend it for an affordable option.,4
2/20/2014,"This mattress is perfect for my guest room. It arrived quickly, delivered right to my front door by FedEx. So nice to not have to pay a delivery fee or rent a truck to haul a new mattress home. The mattress inflated right away, and is firm and comfortable.",4
7/24/2021,Staying in an apartment with my daughter its small so the mattress and frame worked out perfect makes me want to buy a set for myself perfect for the price awesome mattress didnt think it was gonna be as nice as it was would definitely buy over and over again thank you,4
8/2/2013,"I was very surprised about how firm this matterss was considering it came out of a box. It was as advertised; easy to place on the bed, cut the tape, remove packing material, cut open the plastic wrapper & amazingly it filled out in a few minutes. My grandson loves it & has slept well since he got this new matress. He is about 5 foot & weighes about 110lbs. Great value.",4
2/27/2014,"I purchases this mattress as a second bed in my sons new bedroom. The box it came in was beat up and had a hole in it but the mattress was untouched. I took my time and took it out of the box and in rolled it, and put it on the bed. It expanded in a few minutes and was ready to lay on. It's very comfortable. I slept on it, I am not a lightweight and I am very pleased with it. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.",4
3/29/2013,"The slumber 1 mattress in a box is a good product, its very soft & cozy. The reason I say good and not excellent is that all though it's vacum sealed and made to bounce back the coils in the middle where the fold is has not bounced back to its full capasity. I brought the mattress to replace my old one which sink also, I WAITED A FULL 48 HOURS before sleeping on it and the coils did not return to normal from the fold so it is firm all over with a light sink in the middle which will eventualy cause the mattress to be replaced. I wasnt going to use a box spring but I did any way it holds it better . Over all the comfort of the mattress is great I would recommend it to a friend, but for the company that main fold does affect the coils.",4
3/6/2013,"Got it for a good deal is very comfy. Not a hard mattress which was what I was looking for I like a soft bed the only thing that would make it any better would be getting a memory foam to top it off, but even with out the memory foam it's still very comfy.",4
5/21/2014,"I am amazed at the good quality of this Matress when it was shipped to me in a box, I simply cut the box and the bed unfolded and was ready to go in about 30 min. I slepted very well my first night in this bed and I would defintely recommend this product to a friend.",4
9/9/2014,"We purchased this mattress when we kept having back pain from sleeping on our 4 year old mattress. It arrived in 3 days to our house & it came in a box!!! Easy set up, just unroll where you want it & cut open the vacuum sealed plastic, opens to full scale in minutes. We have slept on is since the day we got with & haven't had back pain since.",4
2/16/2014,Great mattress for the price. Comfortable and you can't tell when your mate or spouse gets out of bed which is priceless. Only problem I had was when it was shipped. I paid standard shipping which say it would come the same day as if you paid for fast shipping. So I thought great I don't have to wait as long as if I just did the free shipping. The date they say it was going to arrive it did not. I received one part of my order on Saturday and the other part which was the mattress Monday night. So I could not get off the couch until Monday night. Don't say it would arrive one date and it doesn't is hard.,4
2/10/2014,Excellent purchase. The only reason for 4 stars is that it is not very firm but what can you expect from a mattress in a box. By no means is it intended for an adult to sleep on every night but it works perfect for our daybed. I will be purchasing another for the trundle. This would also be great for a child's bed.,4
3/19/2021,"Great deal for the guest room that only gets slept on twice a year but the King we got for our bed didn't last two nights. It wasn't very comfortable and had sags in it. We wanted to try the whole ""mattress-in-a-box"" thing but it didn't work out so we went back to a traditional pillow-top style mattress.",4
6/4/2014,"Did not look like much all rolled up in a box but when unfolded it was a pleasant surprise.
We ordered two at a time for rental use. Both tenants really please with looks and comfort!
I would presently recommend these. Only after time and more use will I know how they hold up!",4
3/22/2014,"Mattress really does come in a smallish box. It was a family event taking it out. We were fascinated with the process of watching it expand. As for the mattress itself, based on the description I would have thought it would be a bit firmer but my 13 year old says it is comfy, and that's what matters.",4
5/11/2014,"Bought this for a replacement in the guest room. Given the price, not sure this would be great for everyday use but really only time will tell. Packed in a box in a very compressed manner but quickly expanded to full size. We have this one an extremely firm foundation, really made of all wood. So far holding up well with a firm feel. Might be questionable for use with very heavy people, but for <200 pounds a winner for occasional use for sure.",4
7/3/2013,"It fits my needs. This is the mattress where I sleep every day (full size) and is very comfortable. I am about 132 pounds, and my wife is a few pounds lighter. After we removed it from the box and cut the braces, the mattress comes to its real size and form. It is a real heavy mattress and cannot be put in the box again. Incredible how the manufacturer compresses it to fit in the relatively small box.",4
9/10/2013,"This mattress was bought to upgrade from a queen to a king, as well as to fit into our tight budget. The product shipped in a timely manner and were minimal box damages. However, Walmart does not require a signature from delivery which the item(s) ordered are just left at your door. (Don't care for that much). It was packaged well and somewhat easy to undo, but having a king sized may require a back up person...just in case. This was purchased along with the Spa Sensations Steel Smart Base Bed Frame Black, King, which arrived first. The frame says there is no need to get box, but extra support underneath does not hurt. We left the plastic it came wrapped in on the bottom of the mattress because we did not have a full zippered mattress prote...",4
9/19/2016,"I was nervous about ordering "" a mattress in a box"" because I have traditionally gone to a mattress store to view and feel a mattress before making a purchase. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by how soft and comfy this mattress was.it is a firmmattress but plush on the top.  It fluffed out quickly and was a perfect fit for my daughters day bed. The price was excellent and I think that this mattress is even more comfortable than the higher priced mattress I bought for my son from a mattress shop. I would not hesitate to buy this again.",4
5/28/2021,"I have bought one of these before (in a smaller size) and found it to be really good quality. I used it for about 3 years and definitely could have gotten a few more years of use, but we were moving and had to get rid of some bigger items. The only complaint I have for this purchase is that the box was completely torn and open when it was delivered on my front doorway. I do understand the box is quite big and heavy, but it just seems very unprofessional and unclean to see it completely open at delivery.",4
7/20/2013,"After reading all the reviews, which were mostly good, I was still skecptical concerning a mattress this cheap and in a small box. But figured it was worth trying so I bought one. I am not disappointed with my purchase. Don't know how long it will hold up until I have used it for a while. It may be some time before I know, as I bought it to use in our guest bedroom, so it will not be used every night. But once it comes to it's natural size you cannot tell it from a regular mattress. Looks really nice and at me weighing 270 lbs. it is very comfortable.",4
4/1/2014,When I got the box I thought I would be returning it. I pulled it out and tore the plastic bag it came in and the mattress grew very fast. It went back to a normal size mattress and I let it sit for a day. It is a nice mattress and my daughter finds it to be very comfortable.,4
1/16/2014,"When I first saw the bed in a small box , all I could think was what did I do, what is this. Then I opened the box the bed inflated itself, and wow. It is beyond my expectations for the price I figured it would be ok for awhile, but it is very comfortable. Good Buy.",4
7/25/2014,"Not 100% pleased with this mattress but it is definitely better than the ""bag of rocks"" we were sleeping on. We don't toss and turn near as much and you really can't beat the price. Plus the kids found it quite amusing to watch it unfold itself from the box upon delivery.",4
9/24/2016,"I was thrilled that my shipment came so quick. I was sceptical when I saw the mattress rolled up like it was, but after I opened it up I felt better. Then I slept on it that night and was amazed at how well I slept. Great price and comfort for your money.",4
2/24/2014,"I will admit the mattress in a box kind of concerned me, but over all it's a good mattress. Bought for my daughters bed and she seems to be good with it. I will say that it's definitely a mattress for kids. While it is mostly comfortable, I don't think for me I could sleep on it long term",4
10/10/2016,"If you don't have a lot of money to spend and still want something to sleep on, this is the mattress for you! Good mattress at very low price. Been sleeping on it two weeks now, and it's not bad! Not the best mattress I've ever slept on, but it's perfect for what I needed at the price I could afford! Literally comes rolled up in a box and just springs out when you get it open. Give it some time to fully air out and it's ready to sleep on!",4
7/2/2014,"I didn't quite know what to expect from a mattress in a box, but I'm really happy that I bought this! Setup was easy, just unroll the mattress and remove the vacuum-sealed plastic and the mattress just pops right up. The mattress is quite comfortable, though it's not as firm as advertised, which is why it didn't get a five-star rating.
It's only been a few weeks that my husband and I have been using it, but I'd feel comfortable recommending this mattress to anyone who's in the market for one and doesn't have a lot of money to spend. For the price and quality, you really can't go wrong!",4
3/4/2014,I brought this mattress for my 3 year old. I just purchased it so my review is limited. The product seems ok so far. Only problem I have is one corner didn't expand fully which I'm hoping will form in the next couple of days. My son loves it and the value is good for the amount I spent on it.,4
9/7/2013,"I bought this mattress for my teenage daughter and she said that it is a great sleep. The bed is firm so if soft is what you are looking for, perhaps you need a different mattress. It was affordable and works well for teens. I think I will get this same mattress for my guest rooms.",4
2/20/2017,I bought a twin and full size for the kids.  Quick delivery to my door.  Comfortable matress and fair quality.  The springs inside make popping noises occasionally- I don't know what that's all about but I'm happy with the purchase... hope they last ten years.,4
3/4/2014,"It comes in a box about 2 feet square by 4 feet long. You open the box, set it on the floor and in approximately 2 days it stretches its little springs and is a queen-size mattress that is 8 inches thick and compfy as all get out. Wierdest thing I have ever seen - but I would definitely buy another one.",4
9/20/2016,"I bought this for a spare bed to accommodate the occasional over night guest. The delivery was 1 day later than the last estimated delivery day; not a big deal for me as it wasn't needed right away. I opened the mattress the day I brought if home and then left for a week long vacation. When I returned the mattress was fully expanded, firm but soft, and comfortable. I have had guest use it since and there were no complaints.",4
3/31/2014,I received this mattress in a box like the details describe and I too was a sceptic but when I opened the package it quickly took shape and was extremely comfy I am very pleased with my purchase. I purchased this for a child so I don't know about everyday adult use but it is a great buy for kids! Fits Well on the platform style bed also.,4
10/18/2014,"I bought this mattress for my daughter. She loves it and thinks it's very comfortable! I'm satisfied with the purchase. However, had I known the mattress could not be flipped (it does not state that in the description anywhere that I could see) I would not have bought it. The mattress does not seem to be flimsy, the quality seems good. It's been less than a month though and seeing as how I won't be able to flip it every few months, I'm not sure how long it will hold up.",4
12/11/2013,"I ordered this thinking it would arrive like any other mattress. WRONG! It was packaged in a 3 ft x 1.5 ft cardboard box. My husband picked it up from the store. The sales clerk as well as my husband were in disbelief at the packaging. It appeared to simply be a mattress topper or memory foam mattress compressed and packaged. We got it home and removed it from the box and WATCH OUT it was like the water sponges....it just kept growing. Sure enough, it was a twin 8"" mattress w/coils. It was truly amazing. Now, for the comfort review.....my husband and I both lay down on it and it does appear to be quite comfortable for the price. It goes in our granddaughter's room for her bunkbed. Actually, our 33 y/o son (her father) will be sleeping on it...",4
12/1/2013,"First off, we have only had the mattress for a week and it is for my 3 year old. I have not slept on it, but my wife and I have each laid on it and moved around and found it to be very comfortable. We were a bit unsure how a quality mattress could come in a box 1/2 the size, but it has been great. I would recommend this bed for any child or as a guest bed. I would have given it 5 stars, but its just too early to tell. Hands down it is the best bang for your buck.",4
12/7/2013,"This is a good matress.confortable.
But I think the 10"" will b better ... more confortable..
this matress come in the box very compress...
But you need wait around 48 hours to get original size .
GOOD MATRESS FOR THE PRICE.NEXT TIME I WILL B BUY 10""
I THINK I WILL B MORE HAPPY :)",4
5/31/2014,"The mattress expanded to the full 8"" in just an hour or so. Not quite as firm as I expected, but very comfortable and looks good. If/when I need another mattress, especially if I'm still on a tight budget, I will certainly consider buying another one.",4
3/17/2013,"When I first opened the box, I was ready to return it before I cut taped straps. This just want do!!! But I followed instructions, unfolded & allowed mattress to expand, placed it on firm bed frame & we love our mattress-in-a-box. I bought the queen size. Its nice to sleep on all night long with my chica byside me.

Chivo",4
8/31/2021,"I bought two new beds for my kids. My son loves it, daughter hasnt been able to try hers out yet since her fame hadnt come in yet. I saw all the bad reviews about it not puffing up to the full 8in. I didnt measure it but it looks great to me. It felt nice I guess if the little details matter maybe not get it because you could be disappointed, but I think theyre comfortable and nice for the pice!",4
9/24/2014,"I am a college student who just moved into my first off campus home. I am only planning to live in this place 2 years before I head to law school. So, I was looking for something that was affordable yet comfortable. This mattress came relatively quick (about 4 days after ordering it). Once the queen sized mattress came, it was a little difficult to get up the stairs of my house alone. I recommend having a friend or roommate help you. Once I took the mattress out of the box and plastic, it rose almost immediately. I was able to sleep on it that same night (after letting it sit out for about 4 hours). I've had the mattress for about two weeks now and I haven't had any problems at all. Great buy. Great value.",4
4/1/2013,"Ordered this mattress for our 10 year old son's room. We ordered a full size. We ""go big"" with mattress purchases, buying name brand, rather costly mattresses, purchasing a mattress in a box, at a very 'cheap' price was a little frightening. But we are pleased! One person can carry this mattress in it's box, easy to open, fluffs up quickly, most important..comfy! Going to buy another one for our older son.",4
9/24/2014,"This mattress definitely exceeded my expectations. Ease of unpacking...(and really cool watching it unfold and 'poof'), very presentable and soft to touch.
Slept on it after 7 hours and was very comfortable. Was not the firmest choice...but not squishy either.",4
3/21/2017,"We bought this mattress in twin size for our kids bunk beds and loved how comfortable and water resistant it was. We decided to recently purchase a queen size for ourselves and are very pleased. Can't beat it for the price! Great mattress on a budget, not to firm not to soft!",4
9/25/2020,"Bought this fir college apartment. My daughter says this mattress is too soft but she is making due. Oh to be young!
I offered to buy a firmer mattress and she said no. The mattress has a feather bed on top that made her standard dorm plastic covered mattress very comfortable. She has a plush top firmer mattress at home. I think fir the price it was a great buy.",4
7/14/2016,"We already had another mattress like this that lasted for 5 years and was still solid. The only reason we did replace it was after my youngest kept getting hand me downs from big brother so often, we thought they both deserved 2 brand new mattresses to go along with our new house. Just like the old one, they instantly popped into shape when unloaded from the box and we were able to use them that same night. The 5 and 6 year old boys are comfortable and sleep all through the night in their new beds. I certainly would recommend it to a friend because one of my girlfriends asked about them after seeing new ones in my boys rooms and plans on purchasing one for her 8 year old.",4
9/16/2016,"Surprisingly comfortable! Purchased this for college apartment with intent of short term use, but the firmness & quality pleasantly surprised us. It'll hold up longer than expected. Using it in combination with 'Spa Sensations Steel Smart Base Bed Frame', which also has proved to be a solid product. Followed advice of another consumer to purchase a rug pad & place it between mattress & frame to keep mattress in place. All in all, mattress & frame arrived quickly, well packaged & easy to carry home.",4
12/9/2016,"We bought this bed for our 12 yr old and so far he says it's really comfortable. It came vacuum packed in a box and he was able to take it into his room and open it up himself. I was very surprised by how quickly it came back to it's original shape, we opened it in the early afternoon and he was sleeping on it that night. It's a great mattress for the price, would be good for a guest bedroom too.",4
8/18/2016,This is the 2nd one that I have purchased this year. Both are full sized. Mattress is firm but not hard as a rock. The only downside is that it can not be flipped. Maybe I'm just a bit old school but I like being able to flip a mattress over periodically  to keep it from becoming lumpy with age.,4
2/1/2017,"I was surprised when the box showed up because it didn't serum like a queen mattress would be on there. One you open it up and undo the tape,  it stays to expand to its appropriate size.  
It's very comfortable compared to my old mattress. I would definitely recommend to someone needing a new mattress but not wanting to break the bank.",4
11/19/2020,I am 6 ft tall 300 lb the mattress is just a little wide for the frame but other than that it is a good mattress at a good price. I have seen reviews of people complaining about the springs but then I don't have any kids jumping on my bed to do damage,4
2/2/2017,"I needed a new not-too-expensive mattress. I had a super firm very expensive mattress that was like sleeping on a rock.  I gave it to charity and bought a 13"" air mattress which also didn't work. 

I am 72 and 5'6"", 190 lbs, the mattress supports me okay. I don't consider it firm, but at same time not too soft.  I had a 1"" polyfiber mattress topper which I put on it along with a mattress cover, which I think has made it perfect for me.  

As other people have commented, it is heavy, but I was able to push to the bedroom.  I opened when delivered at 8pm, and slept on it at midnight.  No offensive odor.   I have it on regular bed frame and box springs. 

For the price, and the fact that it was delivered to me, I consider it a good purchase an...",4
2/18/2014,"I bought King size mattress. The size is appropriate. The Mattress quality is upto the mark. It took around a day to come to its size. It is heavy for one person to move it within rooms if inflated. Could be too comfy for people who prefer firmer, but ideal for those who like a little soft. Once inflated not easy to move out.",4
8/22/2016,"It's not quite as firm as I had hoped, but it's really quite comfortable, especially at this price. We were amazed by how small the box was as well as how quickly it expanded out to full size. Delivery took almost a week longer than initially stated for some reason.",4
12/6/2013,"It came in a small box, but once we opened it and followed the directions the mattress expanded to the 8"" size. It sleeps very well! There has been one issue, we have a metal bed frame for it and it slides around a lot. We bought s roll of non-slip pad and placed it between teh two and it stays in place.",4
10/7/2014,"I was skeptical at first because the mattress came in a box which I guess I did not realize before purchasing it. But once I opened it and read the instructions, I was at ease. It's a very comfortable bed, I love it so far. I gave it four stars instead of five because it's very flimsy so the bed keeps sinking in between the gaps in my bed frame. So although it is a box spring and mattress in one, I still had to order an addition box spring in hope that the mattress will stay level that way.",4
3/7/2014,"I live in a two story home with very narrow stairs. The mattress was packaged so that I was able to get it upstairs and then open it. Let it sit for 48 hours, per the directions, and it was good to go. Comfortable. Seems a little smaller than a queen. Wish I would have purchased the king. Overall happy with purchase.",4
3/11/2017,"Had hoped for a ""big"" improvement in sleeping over my many-years-old mattress.  I do seem to sleep a little bit better, but not sure the mattress gets the credit.  The whole concept of a mattress rolled tightly into a cylinder that then expands into a pretty normal innerspring mattress is truly mind-boggling.  I gave it even more than the 24 hours called for to fully ""inflate,"" but I think I could have used it in a few hours at most.  I can't be sure it actually ""grew"" more with the extra time.
The mattress is firmer than I had hoped and has a pretty thin pillow-top.  I added my old eggcrate again, and it's not bad.
One thing is certain.  I've never seen anything else that comes close to the price, for which it could have been a disaster.  ...",4
12/12/2016,We were looking for a Queen size mattress for our spare bedroom and found this mattress at Wal-Mart which had great reviews.  They deliver it for free  which was a bonus.  We set it up and it fits perfectly on the box spring that we had.  It seems to be very comfortable and is perfect for what we need it for.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because no one has slept on  the mattress yet.,4
8/30/2013,"Unpacking and situating was a breeze. I bought this for a rental unit and never got to sleep on it myself. I did push down to check its firmness and it seemed sufficient. It may not stand up to my $1,000 mattress set from Sears but hey I couldn't spend that much to furnish this unit. For under $200 I am ecstatic that I was able to complete the set up for another bedroom.",4
9/29/2016,"What a great idea. The convenience of not having to go pick up a mattress and drag it back to the house. Just take it out of the box, cut the plastic and let it open and let it expand for 48 hrs. What an awesome improvement and on top of that it's very comfortable. Individually coil wrapped mattress!!! Convenient and price point perfect. This is a winner all around.",4
4/4/2013,"when i first got the bed home and out of the box, i didnt know what to expect, and after i got it layed out on the bed frame, and it got to the size it was suppose to, i couldnt get over how nice it was, and it is a very soft bed, and it is very comfortable to sleep on, so i am happy i did get it, i just wish it was just a little bit more firmer, but it is still nice,",4
4/7/2020,"Delivery time was good. Packaging was great. Instructions process right on point. Love that a bed in a box can be shipped to a home and be comfy. No hassle with getting upstairs to the guest bedroom. 
Mattress fills nicely. (Only thing I would mention, wish it was thicker than 8"", however meets the purpose). So far, seems comfy.",4
10/21/2014,"So far I'm happy with the mattress. We bought it for our spare room and so-far-so good. We've had one guest to sleep on it and they slept well. It was very easy to setup. It is firm and the height is suffice for my overall need/ objective. With a box spring, it makes up well as a normal bed.",4
2/21/2017,"We purchased this for my 8 year old, after she was having trouble sleeping and complaining that her old mattress was too hard and noisy.   Not having a ton of money at the time, we came across this mattress.  I've never heard of a mattress in a box, but the reviews were good and it was in our price range so we decided to give it a try....and I'm glad we did!  My daughter absolutely loves this mattress and sleeps so much better.  While I've only laid on it a few times, she says its like sleeping on a cloud.  If I was buying for myself, I'd probably choose one that's a little more plush however even though this is a firm mattress, it doesn't feel like sleeping on a slab of concrete.  The quality cant be beat for the price.  When its time for ...",4
8/30/2013,Ordered this mattress for the cost and size. and it ended up being a good value as well. My daughter is very happy sleeping on this mattress in her first apartment. And it was really fun to watch it expand when we took it out of the box. Glad I made the purchase.,4
5/11/2014,"It meets expectations.
Overall good deal.
It does not have any kind of smell, as some are complaining, it is hard enough and seems would be long lasting. I have been using since last 2 weeks for myself (27 years, 139 lbs), quite satisfied.
It won't disappoint you.",4
9/5/2013,"This is a great temporary 1-2 year bed in an adult room or a great 4 year bed for a teenager. I purchased 2. 1 for my room, and 1 for my daughter's room and am satisfied. Walmart shipped ahead of schedule.

It is not the absolute best (I did add a pillow top for extra comfort for mine) but it is comfortable. My daughter finds it very comfortable with no extras. We also purchased a spa sensations base and it took us about 20 mins to set up the bed and mattress. Happy with this purchase.",4
3/7/2014,"This is a great mattress, especially for the price! We've been miserable with a continuous coil mattress and needed an independent coiled one ASAP. This shipped within a few days right to our door, and is worlds more comfortable than the continuous coil one that cost 3x as much. Great deal!",4
8/26/2014,Quick and easy set up. It's alittle bulky so you may need a small bit of assistance getting the mattress in place. As the mattress was for a guest room I slept on it to ensure comfort. I'm very happy with the purchase! I also purchased the low profile box spring for purpose of height. They work well together. Great buy!!,4
4/23/2013,"i was happy this was better than i thought it would be, for the price. Easy to open and the top cover feels so nice and soft . Support fine, like it to be firmer . plan to look into a bedcrate,told this would make it firmer. in all i am please with the mattress,",4
8/5/2016,"I bought this mattress for my 4yr. old granddtr. for her first ""big girl bed"".  She was so excited and couldnt believe a mattress was in the box. 
 Delivered without damage.When my son unpacked /unwrapped the mattress the entire family got quite a kick out of watching it ""do its thing"" , it gave us a show.  It took a few minutes and was ready to sleep on that night. I was amazed at the softness of the mattress cover and the support it offered. Of course being only 4, she loved how comfy it was. Of course the adults had to be the real judge. What a great mattress, it felt good to lay on and it is a pretty mattress. I would have given it a 5 but we have had it less than a month. I believe for her it is a great mattress. I'm thinking about get...",4
8/2/2016,Awesome for the price you can't beat it. I was a little stiff the 1st few nights because I was used to sleeping on a pillow top. Don't get me wrong it's not too firm just more firm then I was used to. I got me a nice topper to go on it now it's perfect.,4
3/16/2013,"Hubby n i am amazed how the mattress springs into shaping itself when unwrapped. First time ever seeing such a thing. Is actually pretty cool watch'n mattress form itself. Its comfortable more than we expect it to be.
And would be GREAT for kids to sleep on. As well for any overnight guests. I would recommend this to anybody who does'nt like hard or very hard mattresses to sleep on.
What makes it even nicer. The mattress has its own box spring in it. Don't need a seperate box spring UNLESS you want or need more heighth to the bed.",4
9/21/2014,"I ordered this for my college bound son. We needed to move him to college and a regular mattress would not have fit in the car. This was perfect and once we let the mattress spring to life we were surprised at how good it actually was. My son is very happy with it and says it is comfortable.

I can't say I would buy this for myself as I have back issues but for a 20 year old, it worked great.",4
12/29/2013,"Got two of these mattresses for a metal day bed and trundle - fit perfectly, and we been using everyday for last two weeks. We went from 1k pillow top to these and we can't complain. They are perfect for the price. We have 230lb relative sleeping on trundle for two weeks straight and he aren't feeling any springs and said it is very comfortable.",4
2/24/2017,"I was really surprised at how comfortable this mattress was, I was shocked at how it came in a box, but after unwrapping this and letting it adjust to it's full size. I'm having the best nights sleep ever. I loved it so much I also ordered a Full size & Twin. One for my son and one for my grandson. I got the Queen. For the price, I am very happy with this. Thank You.",4
5/7/2021,"The matrass is very comfortable and fit my bed perfectly. It didn't take time to expand.  I slept on it the same day it was delivered, had no smell. I need another matrass I sure will buy another one of these.. I am satisfied with my purchase. Glory to JESUS!",4
6/29/2021,This is a very comfortable mattress so far. I've only sleep on it for 4 days so far but so far it's great. Only issue I had was delivery..it was very late. Fed X was bad on delivery. I would recommend that Wal-Mart switch carriers or consumers maybe should order straight from the company and check their carrier. Otherwise to me a five star mattress this far!,4
6/6/2013,"We got this mattress for my toddler because occasionally she needs me or her father to sleep with her. She was in a toddler bed, which meant the floor for us :( We purchased a full-size mattress to put on the floor until she's big enough for a frame and box spring. I also purchased a foam topper and quilted mattress cover to go on this since it was only 8"" tall, and I was worried about the comfort level coming from a box.

It is very comfortable for all of us to sleep on. Hubby and I are both fairly large people, so I don't know how well it would hold up to repeated use by us, but for our 30lb toddler, it's perfect. She started sleeping on it the very first night - no transition period. I was surprised.

The sides do collapse easily as othe...",4
2/15/2014,"This is a decent mattress for the price. I received the mattress fairly quickly. Unpacking it was easy and pretty cool. It came vacuum sealed and once the bag was opened it popped up to actual size. I did let it set for a few hours before I covered with the sheets. It is 8"" and it is a firm mattress. Matter of fact, it is rock hard. I was not expecting it to be as firm as it was so I had to buy an added mattress pad and mattress cover to soften it up. Once I did that the mattress was perfect.",4
12/14/2013,Very good product - but make sure you have a box or base for it - won't work without hard base. Considering box price - total cost of ownership is not really great. but for the matress itself - good enough. Size of packaging is really small and inflation process is fully automated :) and even funny. No issues so far and descent level of comfort for the price listed.,4
2/8/2022,Took a couple days to get it the way it should be. Very firm mattress well worth the price.  Edges are really weak you can easily roll off if you get to close cause they don't have much support there but really for the price it is a good purchase I'm happy with it,4
2/21/2014,"Recently bought it and used for 2 weeks only. It is comfortable so far. Cant say about the life of it.
It was delivered as a rolled blanket completed compressed and vacuumed in a sealed poly bag. Following instructions are mentioned on the box - 1.You must open it within 72 hours of packaging. I recommend you to open it as soon as you get it. 2. For better result you should live it untouched for 48 hours to get it in its original shape and to get it expand to its extent.",4
9/3/2013,"Like many other reviewers I was skeptical at first regarding a mattress that would fit into such a small box...Like those same reviewers I was happily surprised when magic-presto the mattress opened up into a comfortable twin size mattress! Much nicer than the one we had bought my daughter previously. Now, I'm reasonable, I realize you get what you pay for so I was not expecting the same quality as my $1000 Queen, but I'd sleep on it, and get a good night sleep. MOst importantly...my daughter loves it!",4
2/24/2014,"came a week earlier than expected , easy to unpack.
Main reason for purchase was that old mattress had springs that were broken and poking out of the mattress sides. This one is softer than the stated ""firm"", but is quite comfortable. I am sleeping a lot better and my back is not so sore in the mornings.
I would recommend this product ot anyone wishing to replace a worn out mattress.",4
2/24/2013,"After reading all of the excellent reviews, I decided to purchase this mattress for my mother. For the ease of set up and the money, I couldnt really ask for much more. Mom is very happy with her new mattress! However, I didn't realize there were thickness options for this type of mattress. Had I known, I many have chosen a thicker one. This one is good though!",4
1/1/2014,"I, like others who bought this mattress, was very surprised at how good it looks and how comfortable it was for the price. I got it right before my son and his family arrived for Christmas. They slept on it for a week. Said it was really comfortable. A second box spring under it would make it taller and stable if you have the ""slat style"" bed frame (like I did), so, not having a box spring, I had to support each slat with additional pieces of lumber in random places. Its a great buy. Definitely recommend it if you need a starter bed or a mattress for the guestroom.",4
8/7/2014,I purchased 4 of these mattresses for two sets of bunk beds at our vacation rental home. We have only had them for a couple of weeks and they have only been slept on a few times. So far so good. They are not firm but the kids seemed fine on them. I am not sure if you would want these for a 200+ pound adult. They come rolled up in a box and expand out when you take the vacuum seal bag off. So far I am very pleased with these mattresses.,4
7/25/2016,"First of all I was impressed by the way this mattress came in a little box, when I opened the box the mattress was flat and shrunk .......then I told myself ... this is not good ..... but then it  started taking its shape.
The mattress is very comfortable and soft, I would recommend it.",4
4/7/2014,"Purchased to convert a water bed into a regular bed for my grandchildren (ages 13, 2 and a set of twins 1) when they visit. When I laid on it to test it, I stayed there for 30 minutes. It felt better than my bed. I really wanted to switch, but the grandchildren wouldn't hear of it. It is perfect and the price was reasonable.",4
1/27/2017,I received the wrong size first and Walmart quickly remedied and sent the correct one.  It was an interesting process to unpack the new mattress.     I slept great the first night on it...my dogs like it also.  I would give it five star if I had it longer.  It will be interesting to see if it stands the test of time.,4
7/15/2014,"Great idea...I am a single woman without a truck so purchasing and transporting a mattress for my spare room was a challenge. This was an excellent solution as it came in box delivered right to my door and just as the instructions said.....it unrolled and filled out perfectly.

Quite comfortable and sturdy.",4
3/18/2017,I wasn't expecting much for the price. But I'm really satisfied with the purchase. I bought two queens and a full. They are comfortable and fairly firm. Very easy to move.  I bought them with the spa sensations foundations. They work beautifully together. We've been using them for about a month now. They are sure to last.,4
11/1/2012,"This is the second mattress of this type I have purchased, the first one is still giving great comfort but we need a larger bed. I have nothing but good to say about this product. We put a memory foam cover on top at the request of my wife, I prefer it without one. I do not think you will be disappointed with this mattress. Set up is easy and it is very cool to watch it expand.",4
6/25/2013,We were pleasantly surprised that this mattress in a box was soft and firm at the same time. We used this mattress for my 6 year old son's big boy room and he loves it. It would be appropriate for a guest bedroom as well. I would buy another one in the future.,4
7/12/2014,"Don't be surprised at the size of the box this mattress will arrive in! The mattress is literally compressed flat, then jellyrolled into a coil and shipped. The minute I cut open the box, the mattress popped out and started 'growing' to its full height of 8"". Open this box where it has room to grow! Also amazing is the fact that this mattress is firm and surprisingly comfy!!! I found a twin mattress at SAMs for 40 bucks cheaper, but would have had to pay for delivery and schedule it. This one came to my front porch with free shipping! No regrets.",4
2/4/2014,When considering this mattress I actually started with the negative reviews. I also noticed that it had a lot more great reviews. I can say that many of the negative reviews are flat out wrong. I've only had this mattress a week now so time will really tell how well it performs. I really liked the way it came compressed and it popped up like it should. It is actually very firm when laying on it which I personally prefer but can see how it can be too firm for some. I really don't like the fact that it's single sided but knew that before buying. I hope it holds up for a while and I feel that it will serve my needs if it does.,4
11/9/2022,"I liked the mattress, my wife did not (too firm for her).  The problem has been the return.  Evidently Walmart schedules the return with their shipper, EFW.  Then EFW sends an email to schedule the return.  Even if you fill out their online form and reschedule the return, you need to call EFW for an even different schedule because they lack the information that they need for the pickup.  The delivery was fine.  The return has been a nightmare.",4
11/4/2013,"At first sight, I was a little concerned about the mattress, it was a mattress-in-a-box; I was thinking, it wouldn't feel right, it would be a very thin, it wouldn't lay flat, etc. But when I followed the directions....it really was a real mattress and it looks & feels great. If you are in the market for a great mattress at a even better price, this is the one!",4
8/12/2014,"I bought this mattress (full size) for my young son. I had initial reservations on whether it would be truly comfortable based on price as well as it being delivered in a box. To my surprise, the mattress (once expanded to its full size) is comfortable. My son loves it. He's had a restful nights sleep the past several nights since receiving it & has voiced no complaints. So far, I have no complaints either.",4
10/26/2013,"I purchased this and received it at my home right on time as far as delivery goes. True to the manufacturer's words, I took it out of the box and in moments had a full-size bed ready to sleep on.

It looks really nice for the price, and my back and neck has felt so much better since sleeping on it.

I didn't notice any smell like some others have commented on. I would",4
12/16/2013,"This mattress sleeps well under normal circumstances. It is a simple mattress with only one thing in mind and that is for sleep. It keeps its shape and does not lump up in one direction. Very smooth surface all away across. Once asleep you stay asleep, and that to me is the simple purpose of a mattress.",4
3/14/2013,I purchased this because of the reviews I saw lol! It came in a box and unrolled it self like a blow out bed. It's very comfy I sleep like a baby and it's soft. I bought it for my 3 year old n he's happy. Better then buying a used one and good quality. :) FYI: u need a box spring or base!,4
12/9/2013,"This one is pretty good for the price and it comes in a one-person sized package, which was awesome because I was able to move it without my wife's help. Overall, it's good. The only thing I can complain about is that it's a little softer than what I expected.",4
9/2/2013,"I couldn't believe that there was a mattress in the box that was delivered! When I opened it up, there was a queen sized mattress neatly rolled up and vacumn packed in a plastic bag! Upon cutting open the plastic bag, the bed started to unfold and fluff up. It is very comfortable and seems to be holding up well.",4
11/27/2021,"It is a comfortable mattress, and a good deal for the price. However, despite their claims to the contrary, it does transfer motion. 
There is one tip for new purchases: you will need at least two people to set up this mattress. It comes shrink-wrapped inside another bag inside of a box. There is nothing on the box or either bag to tell you how to orient the mattress on the bed. Once you remove the outer bag, it will start inflating, even with the inner bag still on. If you've guessed wrong and need to turn the mattress, it quickly become cumbersome if you're doing it by yourself. Make sure the mattress is correctly positioned before removing the final wrapping.",4
12/1/2013,We bought this for our spare bedroom. We wanted something decently comfortable but not crazy expensive. Once the bed was unwrapped I was happy to feel how comfortable it is. It sits a little lower than a thicker mattress would but it's not too low. I do have my doubts that this bed would last a long time with daily use but it's a fantastic guest bed for the price. I definitely recommend for that purpose.,4
10/24/2014,"My initial reaction when I saw the box was, ""oh no"". I didnt understand how a king size mattress could fit in a 4 foot high box. So I was in a rush to open it to make sure I spent my money on something worthwhile. Once I opened it, the mattress was squeezed down to about 3 inches thick and wrapped in a bundle. I panicked. But once I got the packaging off and air was let into the bag it was covered with, it expanded into a normal king sized mattress. And after laying on it, I was definitely satisfied. I didn't rate it a full 5/5 because of the little heart attack I had when I saw the box.",4
12/13/2013,"Others mentioned in their review that this mattress had an odor upon opening. I did not find that to be so. I bought it for my 4 year old granddaughter, but I tried it out myself, and I think it's pretty comfortable. We'll see how it holds up to the test of time, but for the price, I think it's well worth it.",4
11/25/2013,"I bought the bed for my 4 year old daughter. She loves her new bed. I regret waiting to take it out of the box, I waited 3 days after I received it because the box spring did not come the same day. Unfortunately, the bed did not expand to 8"". I read the instructions when I opened it, and found out you should open immediately or within 48 hours. So if you buy this bed, don't wait. It is still a very comfortable bed and I will buy another if needed for future children!",4
7/6/2014,"I really needed a new mattress and thought about this a lot. I finally ordered it as for me it was easy to have it shipped rather than go to another dealer and also pay a delivery charge. I received it on time. Although, it was heavy, I managed to work with it, with the weight, you may want to have someone help you. Once I completed setting it up, it was like a miracle when I laid on it. It was so comfortable. I was very happy I had made the right choice. I love the warranty. I would recommend this to anyone with no hesitation.",4
9/13/2014,The first night sleeping on mattress felt like coils were poking me in my back. My wife had no issues with her side of mattress. She was tossing and turning throughout the night on old 13yr old mattress. I remembered we did not wait the whole 48 hours maybe 24 hours that they say for mattress to unfold fully. The days after that it felt much better too me. I also had my wife purchase mattress topper 2 inch from Walmart and it feels even better with it on top. I would recommend this but make sure you do what the instructions tell you to do as far as the amount of hours before use.,4
9/2/2022,"The box was a little torn up, but nothing was wrong with the mattress. I purchased a Queen mattress but it's smaller than my queen-sized frame, so I don't think the measurements on the description are right. It's still bigger than a full though.  I've had this mattress for about a week now and it's comfortable but, a little stiff for me though.",4
11/30/2013,"The bed is good for the price. The only real complaint I have is that it is hard to put a sheet on it if you have the bed against the wall. When you pick up on the mattress it fold in half from where it had been previously boxed. It wont hold its shape when you lift up on it, making it difficult to put sheets on. It holds its shape good when lying down though and is very comfortable. Overall a minor complaint for the price and I have no regrets over the purchase.",4
2/22/2013,"The price was great and I got free shipping, even better. The fact that I could put it on bed and let it open up was really cool. So far I am sleeping very well on it and It is comfy, maybe a little too soft for my back but will give it more time to get use to it. I dont think that you can sleep on a mattress for a few nights and rule that it is perfect for you or not. So far I really like it, hope this helps.",4
7/6/2014,"Great Price!!!!-bought 2 based on reviews here for my children12&14 85&115 pounds respectively. Setup is with wooden slats and bunkie board.

SuperFast Delivery- beat expectations on delivery-Ordered Wednesday arrived next day with regular delivery!! (1box torn up but no damage to bed)

Amazing ease of use- carried box up flight of stairs since in box easy to maneuver.

Bed soft and cuddly with some firmness-Children love it!!

Some things that concern me--it's states firm but to me bed is Not Firm( I sleep in a firm mattress). I think like other reviews if you are 250 lb or more this bed will start sinking. I am 190 lbs and I feel that after time it will sink. I would think twice as an adult >200lb buying this for everyday use.

Overall: f...",4
9/7/2014,I have only slept on the mattress 1 day so far and it is very comfortable. It is firm but has some give. It is the perfect size twin for my small room. Very easy to unpack and let it expand fully before using it. I would recommend this mattress to a friend. Very good product so far.,4
7/7/2014,"We bought this mattress for our guest bedroom. Our 20 yr niece is spending the summer with us and has slept on it for a month. She says it's very comfortable although she is using a memory foam topper and only weighs 120 lbs. I laid on it when we received it and it was very comfy. I wouldn't use it as my main mattress but, I think it's good for a guest room or kids room. It was really neat the way it just pops out of packaging and becomes a mattress!",4
3/26/2021,"It's an okay mattress for an online purchase.  It is pretty comfortable, but very flimsy. Unless you plan on using an actual platform bed, you will need a box spring with the mattress, especially if your bed frame has wooden slats to hold the mattress up.",4
5/4/2014,"i bought a queen size- when we first got it, it did have a smell to it. i had read the reviews before buying this and someone else said the same thing. it smelled like a box smell but also a mold smell. so i opened up my window to let it air out and left the door open. everytime i shut my door and re opened it the smell would come back. so i left the door open and didn't sleep on it until i got some febreze and sprayed it down. it took me about a week to sleep on it because i wanted to wait for my allergy bed cover to come and i could put that over the mattress. me and my daughter lay on it and it feels great!! much much better than the air queen bed and the couch thats for sure! yes i would recommend this to a friend. i would say air it ou...",4
6/20/2013,"So i recently moved to a new town and needed a mattress on the cheap that I could use for a couple years and then toss... even the cheapest coil-spring mattresses at the stores are a bit pricier (and I despise the whole haggling back and forth with the salesman - worse than buying a used car). After reading the scores of great reviews I decided to try this thing out. It did arrive timely and in a box! The box was pretty heavy...maybe 70 lbs or so. It fit in the back seat of my camry...thats a plus because then i didnt need to borrow a truck. Directions were easy and it ""inflated"" within 10 minutes. the first night i tossed and turned...but have been fine on it for about 2 weeks now... the mattress is firm and a bit flimsy, but with a box sp...",4
11/30/2013,"I was a little worried this 2 in 1 type mattress would not be comfortable for sleeping but I read the other reviews and most were satisfied with it.
I am a small, light weight person (118 lb) so I am not sure how it would sleep for a larger size person but for me it is ideal. I also wanted something to have as a guest bed for family when they visit, and this has worked out well.
This was purchased primarily for use with a daybed",4
6/28/2021,"I was looking for guest bed mattresses used mainly by grandkids but sometimes adults and I didn't want foam that, in my experience, leaves an imprint after a while. The 8"" spring mattresses arrived within 24 hours, unwrapped easily, and popped into size  correctly. The fabric is soft and appears to be decent quality and the mattresses are well made. They are  quite firm except for along the edges and I would anticipate they might break down after a while if there was frequent sitting on the side of the beds. I already had 1"" foam toppers I used on the previous mattresses and they help soften these new mattresses so I think my guests will be comfy. I am pleased with the purchase, the price, the quality, and the ease of online ordering.",4
3/31/2013,"I read through many reviews before buying this mattress. Most reviews were good, though there are a smaller percentage of bad reviews.
My main concern was getting the mattress and hating it. Would I be able to throw the mattress in a truck, bring to Walmart, and get a refund? After being reassured this was the case I went ahead and bought it.
My old mattress was killing my back. I have slept on this mattress for three weeks and have slept comfortably and my back feels much better. It was set up easily.
My only concern going forward is how long it lasts. If it lasts 5 years I will be happy. If it starts to sink in after a year I will be disappointed. Only time will tell.
I live in Bear, Delaware. There are literally 4 mattress stores within ...",4
1/15/2014,"Indeed. The box really doesn't ruin it. It really does ""inflate"" and regain it's normal shape and isn't all wonky. Of course it's still a mattress for under $200 and it's not some plush pillow top, but it's just fine quality, and especially when coupled with a mattress topper (memory foam for me) it's more than comfortable. Time will tell of course how well the mattress stands up over the long-term, but again- not expecting a lifetime of sleeping on this anyway. Very happy with my purchase.",4
12/19/2013,"We bought these mattresses to move our toddlers into big-kid beds, and it was perfect for a first mattress. We were amazed at how they come packaged - rolled up and compressed in a box and were dubious that they would actually be a substantial mattress, but were pleasantly surprised!

My only complaint to date - the description of the mattress indicates that it works with a platform bed. This means a solid platform base, not bed slats like many other platform beds. We initially bought bed slats and realized very quickly that they wouldn't work as we were setting up the beds. I ended up having to run out and buy twin box springs at the last minute",4
9/1/2014,"This bed would be ok if you were on a tight budget. I would not say that it was firm, but not soft either. Somewhere in the middle. This bed will serve its purpose, but if you want the best mattress around, you should go to a mattress store, and pay much more of course. Recommended for its price and comfortable feeling. Don't think it will hold up for 10 years however.",4
6/29/2014,"We bought a used Toy hauler for camping and we needed a new mattress. A regular mattress would not bend to place into the bed spot, so when I saw this bed in a box idea it solved my problem. Easy to unwrap as instructions and is comfortable for our purpose of use.",4
5/15/2019,"Only 4 stars because I havent gotten a chance to sleep on it to see how it feels all night.  We got this for our son.  I love it.  He only let us lay on it for a few minutes but I am definitely going to buy the king size for my bed.  It is firm, which is what I want because our bed is too plush.  I was worried about how a spring mattress would unfold out of a box, but it is vacuum sealed then rolled as to not damage the springs.",4
9/22/2013,I just bought this product.. I think I have a good buy.. but realistically I need more time to see the durability factor...its a bed. Very impressed with the concept of the ease or handling this purchase...from the ordering process to the simple opening of the boxed packaging is a very good way to get this product to the consumer. Great job there!,4
7/23/2013,"I chose it for the price and how it conveniently comes in a small box which made transportation easy. Seems good so far except that it is a VERY firm mattress and hurt my back. I bought a mattress topper and slept much better. If you don't like extremely firm mattresses, a topper is a must!",4
9/5/2016,"I was a bit skeptical when I heard a king size mattress comes in a box that can fit in the back of my car, but I went for it.  The box easily fit in my trunk, and after unpacking my mattress, it immediately sprung into shape, and was ready to go within a day.  It is just as comfortable as a furniture store mattress.  I bought the king size frame with the mattress using Walmart's bundle deal and ended up with a king size bed for less than $300 total!  I bought a memory foam cover to make it even more comfortable, and am really enjoying my new bed!",4
3/12/2013,"I would like it firmer. Bought this cuz I need a firm mattress for my back. Not as firm as I thought, that's the only reason for four stars. Love the free del. super fast! Got it in 2 days. Nice mattress! Love the convience of it being in the box!
Highly recommended!",4
4/4/2020,"I needed a bigger bed for my son. He grew out of his twin bed. It arrived within 5 days, we were very impress with our first mattress in a box.  The box was small but heavyweight I was skeptical of how can a mattress be compressed in a box expand into a full size bed be comfortable?  Once open we could here it literally expand into a full size mattress! Also a few minor tear in material on the bottom side of the matress. We can't wait to start using the bed. Instructions are to let it air out and take grow into its full potential for 24 to 48 hrs. Hopefully it's as soft as it feels. If not we already have a gel foam matress pad. So far so good. Overall satified with the purchase.",4
3/10/2021,"loved how convenient it was, coming packed in the box. Made moving it to the upstairs bedroom easier. Once the plastic was removed from the mattresses, it expanded to full size very quickly and it is quite comfortable, the only downside is this mattress is heavy and at times I have trouble when changing the bedding, other than that it's a great mattress.",4
12/5/2013,"I was very skeptical buying a mattress online , then the box came and it was so small , my heart sank. then I opened the box and there was this huge full size mattress in this tiny box , I pulled it out and it expaned very rapidly, I put it on the frame(no boxspring) not expecting much from a cheap mattress that came in a tiny box , and I was amazed , it is soooo comfortable , and feels very durable.",4
7/19/2014,Being on a tight budget since I moved into a new apartment I thought I'd have to wait before I could afford a decent mattress. When I saw this product on Walmart.com I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did. It's all I hoped it would be. No more air mattress for me. This is a good mattress at a reasonable price.,4
9/10/2013,Purchased for my son and he loves it. It's a little soft for me but if you're lighter and are not concerned for firm support it should be fine. The mattress fluffed up fine out of the box and took about a day I think to reach it's full potential. Couldn't beat the price and I highly recommend.,4
2/10/2013,"We purchased this mattress as our sons first mattress after his transition out of his crib. He was 18 months old at the time and weighed 24lbs. He has been comfortable and sleeping through the night from the first night. The mattress has a very soft, plush top surface. The springs are very flexible and have a lot of give. It is comfortable, but it seems like an adult using this mattress every night would cause it to wear down quickly. So far, we are very pleased with this product.",4
2/23/2016,"The jury is still out, as we just purchased this mattress a week ago, but so far so good! Bought this in the regular twin size for our daybed to replace an old, worn-out six incher. We have pets, so I was particularly excited, because of it being infused with green tea, seed oil and charcoal. Hoping it would help keep the mattress fresh. Our daybed does see a lot. It sees a lot of heavy use, so time will tell. We have it in our living room and often use to watch t.v. Many times there is at least one adult, along with a large dog or two (over 100lbs). The mattress seems fairly supportive, although it is slightly lumpy. For extra protection, we are using a waterproof mattress cover. Not really sure if it will hold up as good as the old one di...",4
2/5/2013,"I saw this mattress had good reviews, but was worried about a ""mattress in a box."" Do not let this bother you, it ends up being a normal spring mattress like any other once out of the box. It is extremely comfortable. I will be buying another one soon to replace my other bed. Very satisfied.",4
8/4/2014,"Good basic mattress for the price. Great value for money compared to costlier ones in mattress firm and similar stores. It is for my guest bedroom and so I didn't want to spend fortune. Little softer than I expected (specially on the edges), but good back support when sleeping.",4
3/31/2014,"We ordered this mattress because of its adorable price and convenient delivery option, as well as all the great reviews. True to what others have said, the mattress cane or of its box and unfolded beautifully. I sleep better on it then I have in a while. I wake up naturally much earlier and rested. I am about 120 lbs and my husband is 175 or so.",4
9/9/2014,A bit firmer than anticipated but overall a great mattress for the money!! I was a bit shocked when I saw the FedEx confirmation e-mail. The size seemed small and I was concerned that I was receiving the wrong mattress. When I received it the mattress was rolled and much easier to carry up to the second floor. Pleasantly surprised!!,4
12/1/2013,"Warning this mattress will come to you rolled up.

I was highly suspicious when the mattress was delivered and hesitated to open it for a few days. They compressed it and rolled it for better shipping. Pretty cool if I may say so myself

The overall quality of the mattress was very comfortable. It's no pillow top but it was very comfortable nonetheless. I bought a mattress topper and protector because I have a toddle in training. They worked out great.",4
2/28/2014,"Very nice to sleep on, not too soft and not too firm. Looks like it will last a long time. Great with my day bed with no box spring.
It was awesome to unpackage it. It just jumped out of the box a compressed thing and turned into a full blown mattress in a second. Amazing!!",4
12/17/2013,I loved that it was shipped right to my door so I didn't have to worry about carrying to car and loading and unloading. It came in a smallish box but once i opened it the mattress just kept growing and growing. I was recommended this by my mother and would tell others about it. Good bed for good price and i didn't have to mess around with a box spring.,4
5/19/2020,"The bed arrived days late. Pick up from Wal-Mart and the box was damage, but got home the mattress was and good shape. Once unwrap, the mattress indeed inflated quickly into a queen size mattress. Very comfortable, firm and soft. I purchase the Mainstay queen size bed frame and the mattress fits perfectly. I didn't wait 48 hours, to let it inflate all the way, but it gave it over 6 hours to inflate, before guest arrived. Guest slept on the mattress and stated he had the best sleep in a long time. Four stars cause it was delayed multiple of times.",4
11/16/2013,"It takes a few years of consistency to know if a mattress is constructed decently. So far the only thing bad I notice when opening the box was that the mattress cannot be flipped over. Its only soft on one side, and the other side has springs against the material. Flipping the mattress over periodically tremendously extends the life of it. PS - I am not the one who is sleeping on it.",4
9/3/2016,"I was a little hesitant about getting a ""mattress in a box"" and at this price. When it arrived, I was extremely pleased! The mattress is sturdy but not rock hard, so if that's what you like, this is the mattress for you! It's also really easy to put up, just take it out of its packaging and it in inflates (not an air mattress, but that's the easiest way to describe it).",4
9/26/2013,"I just got this a week ago. I returned my foam mattress i bought from here. This is not as firm as it sais but its good, and I get no back pain unlike the foam mattress. I sleep through the night. Its really springy, you can feel the springs but its not hard. I wanna jump on it because it feels so springy lol. Its a good bed so far , Its only been a week so ill see if it lasts another month. If not ill return it again.",4
11/27/2013,"Totally exceeded my expectations! I was worried about the width/depth; because it was 'in a box,' I figured it would be the depth of a piece of paper but man was I wrong. And it expands within minutes of opening. Very comfortable and soft. I'm extremely satisfied.",4
3/17/2013,It's a good mattress for the money. Paid $130 and it was compressed in a box but followed directions and it sprung to life. However the edges have no support collapses with 120 lbs. But if you are under a 100 lbs you will like it. I needed 2 for a trundle but will be putting this one on the bottom and paying more for the top mattress.,4
4/9/2014,"I bought two of these as my girls were moving up from the twin beds. I had them delivered, and was very surprised to see the small box they came in. Once I got the box open, I realized they were folded in half and vacuum sealed. I thought there was no way that they could be useful since they do have coils inside. I was wrong. They immediately took form and there was no signs they were ever squished. My girls love them. They are very comphy. I would buy again if needed.",4
2/20/2023,"Solid Mattress for the price. Was easy to remove from packaging, and it inflated quickly after doing so. It was a bit firm the first day of using it, but after 48 hours it feels much softer. The instructions mentioned something about a possible odor after removing from packaging, but I didn't smell anything. Overall, if you need a mattress you can do a lot worse than this.",4
1/6/2014,"This is clearly not the best mattress on the market, but I will say, for the price I am pleasantly surprised. It is comfortable, and I have been sleeping much better since I got this. I have it on the Spa Sensations platform frame and I am very pleased. If you're on a tight budget, I would say give this mattress a try. I am, so far, very happy with it.",4
12/13/2013,While not the quality of a sealy bed it is surprisingly comfortable. I bought a mattress topper and base and mattress for $300 - combined it feels like an expensive bed without the added cost of shipping. (From my research it's at least 250 for a quality mattresses by itself).,4
10/16/2014,"I bought this for my guest room. A little softer than I would want for every day but comfortable for occasional use - don't want guests staying too long. Amazing packaging for shipment. Arrived compressed and rolled in a box that does not look like a mattress so it is easy to handle and does not get damaged. When opened, it recovered shape in less than one hour.",4
12/8/2012,"I buy this for my 2 granddaughter who often will stay during the school year, (Monday thru Friday)in order for them to play sport & drama classes. Both of them so far have enjoy there nights sleeping on the matress. I feel for the price and the all in one you can't get a better buy.",4
5/25/2016,Arrived a couple days later than expected.   The price was right.  I Let the mattress inflate for about 4 days before sleeping on it..  Mattress is not as FIRM as I would have liked but Overall it comfortable and I would definitely recommend this item.   Will also buy again..,4
7/6/2014,"I was rather skeptical about buying this mattress, but after reading the reviews decided to take a chance on it. I am glad I did, it came in a box and when released came to full size quickly, it is comfortable and was very reasonably priced. I am happy with it so far.",4
12/28/2013,"I bought this mattress in queen size for my guest room. It's packaging was amazing to see. It is shrink wrapped and rolled up tight. Carried it upstairs in the box and then released it. And I mean released, spit it's plastic wrap and in 10 seconds it was a perfectly comfy guest mattress. Not sure how it would be for every night but as a guest bed it more than fits the bill.",4
5/20/2021,"Very pleased! First time buying a mattress from a box and I am pleasantly surprised. Shipping and arrival was easy. Unpacking and setting up the mattress was easy as well, and interesting to watch as the mattress unfolded! We ordered a King size mattress and have been very content with it so far. Pretty comfortable, not bad for the price. If you're considering buying, I would recommend.",4
2/2/2014,"I purchased this to go with a frame I was purchasing. The price seemed comparably reasonable.

In the main product description, not videos or extra links or anything beyond what is printed right there in the specifications and such, there is no mention that it is recommended to allow the mattress a day or two to fully fill out. Unfortunately I was going to have to sleep on it that night as my other bed had been removed. It had a few hours to do its thing before I made the bed and over 12 before I slept.

I compared the measurements listed here to the frame measurements, and that of the mattress protectors I was intending to use prior to ordering the mattress.

So far no major complaints.",4
1/9/2014,"To be truthful mattress in a box is a excellent buy hands down, went it unroll I didn't think much of it but went it was complete I was very happy with the mattress overall, I'd recommend mattress in a box to anyone and you could match mattress in a box to any good mattress in any store.",4
3/9/2017,"I got this mattress and a4"" memory foam topper and it is better than the sub par IKEA mattress (which came with 25 year warranty but IKEA lies and wont replace it when it has factory defects) 

This bed combo was for my teen and improved his sleep 100%. 

Only setback is both mattress and foam top have very strong chemical smell and hard to sleep on for a week because of it. If you dont need to sleep on it right away let it air out uncovered for a week . 

Other than the cancer causing side of it, it is very comfy. Mattress very firm without the topper.",4
8/4/2014,"A real spring mattress rolled in a box. The vacuum seal the mattress to place it in a small box. As soon as you take it from its wrap it ""inflates"" automatically.
The quality of the product is very good; including the fabrics.
It is a little bit shorter than expected. I suggest to check the actual dimensions before selecting the model.
It's very comfortable.
Once inflated it cannot be re-packed in the box.",4
2/27/2014,Got this for my son to complete the conversion from toddler to full on his crib and man it makes me want to throw my pillowtop mattress right out the window. I find myself laying in his bed more! Might just have to replace my bed for one like his. Great price too!,4
3/19/2023,"This is a great mattress for the price! Honestly, very impressed! It came in a large box, 40”tall x 15”x 15”, heavy but not too heavy (I'm not that crazy strong of a female and I managed). The mattress comes rolled up crazy tight, so when you CAREFULLY cut it open, you can hear the air escaping and watch the mattress “air up”. It's actually pretty cool to watch, my son got a kick out of it. When first seeing and pushing on the mattress once it was laid out, I was a bit worried it wouldn't be soft enough. So we sat the mattress up against the wall for a couple days, longer than the recommended time, and by then it was fluffed and ready to be slept on comfortably. You could definitely see the quilted top by then. Probably would've been fine a...",5
11/14/2023,"I love this mattress it's outstanding it came packaged well I mean it's easy to follow instructions. All you have to do is just cut off the plastic and let it air out and oh my God, you talk about the best night sleep or nap ever I love this mattress this is great . It's worth your money.",5
5/14/2013,"The bed is really easy to move around since it is compacted into such a small box. It inflated very quickly. As soon as I took it out of the box and unrolled it, it immediately started expanding to its original size. The bed is very comfortable and there is no weird smell or anything like that. It's an excellent purchase considering how inexpensive the bed is. I'm extremely satisfied with the bed. ""Bed in a box"" sounded pretty sketchy to me but its totally fine after you take it out and let it expand.",5
8/27/2016,"This mattress is very comfortable and soft. Purchased for our daughter's off campus apartment. The mattress is shipped rolled up, but expands once the plastic is removed. I would definitely purchase this brand again, as well as recommend it. Believe the ratings, because not only are they accurate, they played a big part in my purchase. Don'the forget to purchase the bundled frame.",5
8/11/2016,"I bought this mattress for my daughters bed (twin size) and it is so much nicer than I expected! I wasn't sure about a ""mattress in a box"" but it's very soft, plush, and comfortable. We have only had it a week so not sure how it will hold up in the long run but great deal for $90!",5
7/21/2021,"super dooper amazing find! I read reviews , look at pics, and sometimes go against what others wrote and try it myself.  But I had my eye on this mattress for a while . I decided to purchase a trundle bed Full size top and twin bottom so I said let me buy it. I bought it when the shipping was free!! anyways,  It came in a tall box and it has some weight 40-50lbs . I slowly unraveled it and read the directions.  it comes with specific directions so you must read..so I opened with caution because it is zipped airtight...it slowly unrolled on my flat carpet on top of the plastic it came in. and Walaaa....it was 8"" within 4 minutes.  As far as the smell,  not crazy but I had my lysol ready so I sprayed away. Now, the coils are visible and you c...",5
12/15/2016,This was purchased for a 3-year old's first ' big girl' bed!! Could not believe this mattress could be rolled into a box!! When unwrapped it began to 'inflate' and soon was nearly to size. Directions say it takes 48 hours. Anyhow her mommy kind of took it over and raves over the comfort!!! Mommy was evicted!!!,5
2/6/2012,"I have a day bed frame and was looking for comfortable mattresses to use on them. I read the reviews and was impressed. It is true these mattresses are so comfortable. My day bed has a pop-up trundle bed that folds under it. The mattresses were bought for my guest room so that I can use it as a studio couch in my office on a daily basis and when I have guests it opens into a king sized bed. I had to test them out to make sure they were good enough for my guest, and they are. I slept like a baby.
Thanks Walmart
Rumpoint",5
9/23/2023,Some of the other reviews weren't great so I was kinda nervous but I have no complaints so far for this mattress. Didn't take long at all to inflate (I did not wait the recommended 48 hours before sleeping on it) haven't measured it but seems it's reached the height it's supposed to be. (8inches) definitely comfortable and soft. I would buy again.,5
3/30/2017,Great Option. I bought this online and was a little thrown off as it arrived in a little box and thought they had shipped the wrong thing. When I opened the box it was vaccumed sealed to 1 inch flat and rolled up like a barrito. I thought there is no way that's a whole mattress. But once the seal was broke it popped open to full size like a river raft it was actually pretty cool. The mattress felt really good firm but soft I was very impressed and may by another one for another bedroom.,5
8/16/2023,Great quality and affordable price. I bough this for my son's room. I find it a little firmer than expected (and than I like) but he has had no issue sleeping on it. Box was easy to open and mattress sprang to life very quickly. No issues with smells. Definitely would buy again.,5
5/28/2014,"I purchased the platform South Shore Queen Bed with the two drawers underneath, and then this mattress for my finished basement/my bedroom. It looks great with the hardwood floors and the price was perfect for just the look I wanted. The Matress is very comfortable and don't need to add any memory foam at all. It was delivered in 5 days and you open the box and in no time it is a full Queen Matress ready for use!",5
9/19/2022,"The best was fine it's firm but not to firm. I looked at the comments before buying it and I took a chance and actually got a good bed. Nothing wrong with it at all. Standard queen sized bed I even got a 2 in topper and it's amazing, sleep like a baby.",5
6/3/2014,"I suffer from fibromyalgia which often leaves me in a great deal of pain. In the past I have purchased more expensive mattresses to find them in worse condition as well as providing no relief. In the past I purchased the twin size mattress which we still have and instantly fell in love. The softness and the comfort is AMAZING! Especially for the price you can't beat it! Now, if your expecting to get a $10,000 mattress for this price or top of the line try else where this is NOT the mattress for you but if your expecting to get a fairly decent mattress that is comfortable for a great price than look no further! Most people including myself seem amazed at how the mattress unfolds out of the box and starts to slowly rise to it's proper positio...",5
12/12/2016,"I was looking for a mattress that was nice, firm, and affordable and this one has it all. The quality of the mattress is good and provides a wonderful night's rest. The firmness of the mattress is comfortable and supportive. Finally, the low price fit my budget perfectly. Overall, I am very happy with my new mattress.",5
8/14/2021,"Its actually really nice. I got this mattress because it was cheap Usually I read reviews but when I saw the price I was excited.. and it wasnt until after I ordered it that I looked at the reviews. I got to admit I was kind of worried because people are saying it kind of doesnt last long. But honestly if you know how to take care of things I think this will be fine. Its soft and I cant feel the springs inside of it, and the inflating was exciting. Im gonna get a Bed frame next week. But this is wonderful honestly. Its my first time buying a mattress and Im 18. I honestly don't care if its not meant to last, I need this for now, and Ill buy supports and stuff. But I like it.",5
4/18/2021,Expanding really well. I bought 2 one for my son and one for me. It's perfect not to soft and not to hard. I sleep well on it and it helps my back. I have nothing to complain about really except it has lifted a little were I lay like a bubble but I move a lot and spend lots of time in bed due to Pots. I recommend everyone buying this mattress.,5
7/12/2021,"First time purchase of a mattress in a box.. queen size. I was anxious to open . Very pleased with my purchase. Once I began cutting away the plastic, a hissing sound was heard which I realized was the mattress being inflated. I was in awe. Definitely a must have and YES, I VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",5
4/17/2020,l was skeptical about purchasing a mattress in a box but i took a chance. When they delivered the box it was in terrible shape the tape on the box was lose and the top was wide open. However once i opened the mattress it was sealed in the wrap and we laid it on the bed then cut it it inflated like a water raft. I purchased the full size one for a guess room my grown son who is over 200 lbs slept on it and said it is wonderful. I am so satisfied with the bed and will be purchasing a queen size one for an extra bedroom in the near future.,5
2/5/2021,"Its says extra firm, it doesnt feel like an extra firm although i dont get any pain in my shoulder unlike other mattress. It is an EXTREMELY AMAZING mattress for the price; I am literally blown away. I would be curious to try Zinus top of the line. The guys have quite a sense of humor, they are extremely sweet. They will help you and make recommendations depending on what you feel is missing to make your bed perfect. With this mattress, I feel like a topper will make it perfect. I like that theres not too much crap around the edges: it allows you to customize it and make it fit wherever you want. I literally have nothing on it so far (i know i shouldnt but... shipping is late lol) i sleep directly on the mattress: nothing else, and it feels...",5
1/29/2017,"Even though I read many reviews about this mattress, I was still a bit skeptical about a mattress in a box.  However, we needed to replace a sofa couch with a bed, and this looked like an economical  way to do so.  The mattress and foundation were delivered exactly as planned, and the wonderful Fedex driver wheeled them right in to our bedroom, even giving our dog a treat.  I am 82, and my husband is 85,  so this was important to us.  We thought we might need help to get it set up, but we had it done in fifteen minutes.  The instructions were explicit and we needed no tools to set it up.  The mattress is beautiful, comfortable, and a real bed, when combined with the foundation.  We are more than pleased.",5
3/3/2014,"I was wary of ordering a mattress in a box, but decided that the price and reviews made it worth a try. I got the twin size for my daughter's bunk bed. It is so much better than I expected! It comes flat and rolled up in the box. It only took a couple of minutes to expand to it's full size. It is firm and very comfortable.",5
12/17/2013,walmart is the best. I I bought this foam bed which was really bad for my back n i turn it in to the nearest walmart because the product was ship to my house. I had a 90 day period and im so happy to get the prefect bed. Thank you walmart for your help. I enjoy this bed so much you should g mtet it. I took picture of,5
1/25/2021,"We have had this for a few weeks now. We purchased it for my daughters first big girl bed and it is perfect! It is really comfortable (if you like a firm mattress). You could easily make it softer with a topper, but I do not think it needs one. So happy with this",5
12/19/2012,"I was very skeptical even with the good reviews but we ordered this to go in my daughter's (5 yr old) room for her daybed. It's not too low and not too high of a mattress and is just right. So far my mom and my husband have slept in her bed, so it holds up for adults too. Couldn't be more thrilled that we paid $150 for a decent new mattress. It's surprising how it inflates IMMEDIATELY after you take it out of the box and wrapping. Who knew, this would work out like it did...we are way beyond happy with this purchase, so ""don't sleep on this savings""! :-)",5
4/12/2021,I just want to say they are perfect!!! They are soft and comfy and they came 3 days early!! After I finally got my daughters bed frames yesterday it's perfect timing!! Yes I was very hesitant to buy them but I'm so glad I did cause they are worth it!!! They fit in the frame so perfect as well!! I'm so happy I bought them!,5
11/4/2023,This mattress is unbeatable for the price it's a steal. Purchased a full sized mattress for my toddler. I'm amazed at the quality. Beautiful mattress with great support,5
10/31/2023,"First off, be warned! This mattress has kung fu power LOL! It unfolded quick and easy, emphasis on the quick! So comfortable it's ah'mazing! I have recommended this mattress to friends and family. Will purchase again!",5
2/16/2017,We bought this mattress for my son but we can't help going to his bed to take a nap since it is the best mattress we've ever experienced. It is very soft and cozy. It's an amazing mattress for the price! We love it!,5
10/3/2016,I bought a full size mattress for my kids bottom bunk and we were surprised at the quality of the mattress. I received package 2 days ahead of schedule. The bed is beyond comfortable!! Very happy with purchase that I ordered a king size mattress!!,5
6/18/2021,"I'm absolutely amazed! I was so skeptical about purchasing a mattress in a box, but they are comfy and just perfect for our need. 
Thanks a bunch for having a mattress at a very affordable price!",5
7/25/2016,I bought this mattress about a year ago and it was amazing but sadly I had to leave it at my last apartment because it was TOO BIG so instead since this thing is so insanely well priced i just decided to rebuy a new one!,5
4/19/2021,"I bought this Zinus mattress for a guest room that is hardly used. But it's probably the best mattress in the house! From my 4 yr old grandson to my 6' son have said how comfortable that bed is. Ordering, receiving",5
12/2/2022,I honestly can't believe this mattress has any bad reviews.  It's awesome.  It came up to 8 inches within an hour of opening. It's firm but not hard. The top of it has nice padding. Great buy.,5
5/5/2021,Mattress was delivered in the box. No problem. Put it on my daybed. I am sleeping very well with it. Very comfortable. Very happy with my purchase. I always try to find what I need at Walmart.com.,5
12/1/2022,"We bought a twin for my daughter and the packaging was amazingly done well. When the air got into the mattress, it pooped up. So cool. We both tried it and it's so soft. I'll give an update later. 👍🏼",5
1/23/2017,I bought this mattress for my daughter's birthday. Once it was set up I tried it out. I loved it so much that I wanted to switch beds with my daughter. It's  just the right amount of soft and firm.,5
4/8/2013,Was very easy to get into my daughter's room for her first big girl bed. Very comfortable too (I've had more than one night sleeping on it with her:-),5
2/12/2017,I was looking for a mattress but I didn't wanted to spend like 400.00 and I found this and after reading the good reviews I decided to get it. It was very fast delivery. I ordered it on Sunday and I received by Wednesday. Very good mattress.,5
8/15/2013,I bought this online from Walmart. The shipping was great and packaging is awesome. Totally love it. This is much firm than the Serta plush mattress I already have from American Mattress. Overall good buy.,5
3/21/2021,This is a great mattress. when it got to our home I thought it was going to be teeny tiny by the box but it was vacuum packed and turned out to be great. It is well worth the money my daughter is so happy,5
1/14/2017,"I am absolutely in love with this mattress! My husband and I needed a new mattress and im so glad we chose this one. Its definitely a perfect mattress for such a low price, squishy and firm, best sleep I've ever had!",5
7/23/2020,I was amazed . the hardest part for me was getting out of the box and removing plastic. I'm 65 and it took me less than 45 minutes to put together the bed frame I purchased and get the mattress on. and in between I broke down my boxes.,5
3/11/2017,This mattress is very nice. It's soft and felt amazing! My husband sleeps great and I never wake him anymore when I wake in the night.  We hardly toss or turn in the night with this bed. Perfect and wonderful for the price!,5
10/12/2016,"This is one of the best mattress ever hands down! My mom is very selective and loves this bed!!!! She flew in from England and she said, it was so comfortable she slept like a baby after a very long flight!!!! So thank you, Walmart for making a comfortable bed so affordable, it's amazing.",5
12/26/2023,It looks just like the picture. Great mattress for a kid bed.,5

4/2/2023,"Very comfortable I must say, optimized balance of soft %26 firm mattress. You wake up all fresh even with less number of hours ! Has been a good purchase",5
10/14/2016,It is everything that was said it is and its just as good or better as any mattress you would pay hundred of dollars for. I plan on purchasing another one in the future. Really wish I knew about this before I spent money on on other mattress I purchased from an outlet store. Brought the bed frame also from Walmart. Love them both soooo much.,5
2/25/2017,It's very comfortable to my children,5
10/21/2023,It's big  and soft I love it,5

10/6/2023,I love this mattress its so comfy,5
9/12/2016,This mattress was perfect for the bunk bed I bought,5

7/30/2021,"Love this bed very comfortable for my son. Will
Be ordering a king size. Worth the purchase. Nice full size bed.",5
4/25/2021,"very comfortable!! fits great on the frame I also purchased here!! sleeps great, folded out an expanded great no issues!",5
10/22/2019,"Love these mattresses! So far in a year I've bought a king and I just bought a twin in store and ordered the other twin online. My king is just as comfy as day I bought it almost a year ago. The new twin ones feel just as good. Comfy,semi firm but not too firm plus at a great price!",5
9/12/2021,Very happy with this mattress so far! We bought it for our toddlers new bed. I purchased the full size 8” and with in an hour it was expanded and the size it was suppose to be. Very comfortable and says it can be used without a foundation which is what I was looking for.,5
11/3/2019,"Got twin size for my toddler who was ready for a big girl bed. Its perfect! Good price and super comfortable. Immidiately rose to original size as soon as i cut the bag open. It does have a smell but barely at all, and im sure itll go away. I definitely recommend",5
12/21/2021,"This mattress is fantastic! Fit the bottom part of our bunk bed just fine. It came folded in half and rolled up, nice and neat, which surprised me since it is innerspring, but it opened up beautifully and we had no problems with it. It was right about eight inches high, and I think it is more comfortable than our fancier memory foam mattress. Seems to be well made. Great buy for the price.",5
12/10/2021,"Nice.  I haven't used it yet as I just got the bedframe assembled.  Did actually expand to close to 10"".  Was a bit heavier than I anticipated but getting it into the house and on to the bed was not too hard by myself.  I am using it with a box spring base.",5
11/1/2021,i unboxed my mattress today immediately got his full size 8 inches. i was worried abot the springs and even ehen you can feel it on the sides when you lay onto the mattress is really comfortable.  i bought a twin  for my mom. 135 pounds and it's perfect.   I recommend it. totally worthy.,5
4/30/2023,Surprisingly comfortable; Reasonably priced.,5
1/3/2021,Mattress came rolled nicely in a box. Unpacked and it fits bed accordingly. Soft mattress.,5
7/24/2021,I was really surprised by the softness and bounce to this mattress. Now looking at replacing our kind sleep number bed with one,5
12/30/2021,"I was surprised to see it open up rig by away, I thought I would've had to wait an hour to inflate but I didn't. This bed is comfortable and an perfect fit in my new place",5
12/10/2021,"Super convenient package, fast shipping and very comfortable! It's still inflating in the picture as I just open it. It says that you should wait 48 hours for it to decompress.",5
8/6/2011,"I purchased this mattress after buying a new bed. I was nervous about it, thinking that I would hate it. Turns out, I loved it! It quickly took shape after I took it out of the box and unrolled it, and I slept on it that same night with no problems! You can't even tell that it came from a box. I do recommend getting a mattress pad, though, because sometimes if you turn over, you can feel the springs moving.",5
3/8/2017,"Got the mattress in today, was pretty impressed watching the before and after of it being so skinny and smushed into this box but once it popped out into its full size it was so soft and comfortable and thick! I laid on it and didn't sink in, I think it's going to work very well for my daughters loft bed. Going to get two more to replace the cheap flimsy mattresses in a box I ordered from Kmart for 50 bucks a few years ago. This actually has springs in it too.",5
10/22/2017,"I bought two of these mattress for my girls (5 & 3) and they are perfect for what we needed. They came in a box.  All you have to do is unroll the mattress and let it sit for awhile.  They instructions say that it can take up to 48 hours for it to reach its normal size, but I put it on their beds within an hour.  The comfort level seems to be good.  I have no complaints.  I think they will hold up well.  It's a great mattress for the price.",5
2/28/2014,"I was put in a sticky situation with a tight budget, so I needed to find affordable bedroom items. I ended up getting the Bali Bronze queen bed along with this mattress off of the Walmart website. The mattress was ordered on Friday and arrived via Fedex on Tuesday. I didnt exactly have the highest expectations since this mattress was on the cheaper side and I just needed something quickly. When it arrived, it expanded in about two hours. When I finally slept on it, MY MIND WAS BLOWN! This is hands down the most comfortable mattress ive ever owned/ slept on. I used to have a lot of issues with waking up constantly throughout the night, but with this new mattress I sleep through the whole night!! I have already been recommending it to friends...",5
2/9/2017,I was so scared to spend even 100 on this mattress. But for 89 buck then 96 with taxes PLUS free shipping this was a steal!! It is super comfortable. Kids have a metal frame bed and i was nervous about them feeling the base rails but you cant tell not one bit. I bought one to test it out. It measure exactly 8 inches.   Now I am purchasing a 2nd for the top buck.  Its slightly firm but plush to contort to your body But mind you it was not 24hrs-48 when i tried it. It was more like 1 hr.  My 6 yr old slept good.  BUY IT! you will not regret it. Trust me. Next I will be getting one for my Queen bed soon. hopefully it will still be on sale.,5
6/30/2016,"I read the reviews when considering to purchase this mattress and all the reviews were great. Therefore, I went ahead and ordered it. I love it! I took it out of the box and it unrolled as if it were never in a box. I was impressed! The picture attached was taken only five minutes after I took it out of the box. It works perfectly for the bottom bunk, my son loves it, and it was a great price!! You will not regret buying this mattress.",5
3/29/2013,"I got this for my daughter when we recently purchased the Summer Breeze twin beds with headboard. I already had one mattress (we had a twin over full bunk before these beds) so only needed to buy one. I did my research and this mattress got outstanding reviews so I went for it. I must say that I'm HIGHLY IMPRESSED! It is ridiculously comfortable!! So comfortable that when I took a nap the other day, I went into my daughters room and slept in HER bed instead of my kind sized bed with expensive mattress - no I am NOT kidding! I am planning to get my other daughter this mattress as well, it is THAT comfortable. So glad I found these reviews. And I cannot believe what a great deal it is. The kids LOVED watching it fill up when we removed it fro...",5
12/18/2011,"Read the reviews online and being a regular Walmart customer decided to give it a try. What a great deal! The price for this quality mattress is unbeatable! Quick delivery, bulky box but easily fit into my back seat. Unpacking was the fun part - loved hearing the WHOOSH part as the compression packing was cut open!! It's springy, comfortable and has just the right support for a restful sleep! Using it alone (no box spring) on a platform bed with a comforter from Walmart - NICE!",5
2/11/2012,"I bought this mattress for my 4 year old daughter's new twin bed after reading all the positive reviews. The price is great & I loved the convenience of being able to have it shipped directly to the store for free & being able to transport it home in the trunk of our family sedan. First of all, the way they package these mattresses is genius. You simply unroll it, place it on the frame, cut the plastic and *poof* you've got an 8 inch mattress! Like most of the other reviews have mentioned it's a very firm mattress & it's only padded on one side so it can't be flipped over. My daughter has special needs & used to wake often during the night. Since she's been sleeping on this mattress she's been sleeping soundly through the night so that in i...",5
7/28/2017,I was pleasantly surprised with this mattress. Make sure you give it a full 48 hours before you lay on it. I didn't notice any weird smell. It was super easy to setup and very comfy. I strongly recommend. The photo below is only 10 min after unwrapping it has already inflated double its size. I will give an update in 6 months.,5
9/2/2017,I was very skeptical of this purchase considering how cheap the mattress was. I am now in love with it. Super comfortable. Better than my last one which I spent over 700 on. Absolutely love the purchase. I also bought the bed from Walmart and it's just gorgeous,5
3/28/2012,"Let me take a moment to say how awesome the packaging for this is. We bought a king and it came in a small 2 by 2 by 4 box and was vacuum packed and folded to fit. Opening that and having a king spring out of it was perhaps the highlight of my month (I need to get out more). After sleeping on a hard queen bed for a year this thing was a god send. No too hard and not to soft. If you step on it you will go through the springs down through your box spring, so I wouldn't advise walking on your bed or jumping on it.",5
5/15/2014,"I got this mattress yesterday and today was the first time i slept on it.So comfortable and nice.
Mattress comes in a package .when you unpack it-let the air out and within 30min the mattress was its full size.I would recommend to leave it ""breath""for an hour.then it is all good.
Delivery was prompt-even 3 days than expected.
I hope it will stay that great throught time.",5
6/26/2017,"I ordered 2 full size mattresses for each of my sons rooms. Like everyone says... it comes rolled on a box and vacuum sealed. Once I got the mattresses on the boys bed, and since the boys are away for the summer, I decided to test it out. I'm thinking I need to see if these 6000+ 4/5 star reviews on this mattress is accurate. Saturday night I slept in one of my sons rooms on this new mattress and the next morning I didnt want to get up. This must be the best sleep I've had in over 10 years. This mattress is so comfortable that every position I lay in is perfect. I slept like a baby... I wanted to suck my thumb(lol jk)  Before getting out of bed I ordered myself the same mattress in queen size for my room. I havent returned to my bed and won...",5
9/12/2016,I received this bed in a moderately big package. (I'm 140lbs) Very easy to move by myself into my bedroom. It was easy to unpackage and inflated in a matter of seconds. The instructions stated to wait 48 hours to enjoy the beds full potential but I only waited 8 hours haha yet it was surprisingly super soft. I felt no springs while laying down and I've had it now for almost a week. I love it!!! Definitely a great purchase!! (I order the full sized bed by the way),5
2/26/2017,"I was skeptical but thought I would give this mattress a try since I didn't have the time to physically shop sales only to be told the great deal was not available and I should spend more on another model. This was so easy! The box showed up at my back door and I was able to maneuver it inside and into a room that had a lot of floor space! And, I'm 63 years old with a bad back! I was so happy with it that I bought another one for my guest room. I have been enjoying this mattress for a year and still love going to bed at night.",5
5/20/2016,"I was a tad disappointed when I first opened it because I could feel the coils and thought the top padding wasn't thick enough. Less than 1/2 later I came back and touched the mattress again, this time I couldn't feel the coil and the top padding is fluffed up and feels much better.  The firmness of the mattress is perfect for me. Will be buying a second one for my other bedroom.",5
8/12/2011,"I bought this mattress for my guest room. I put it on the bed frame (from walmart) no box spring needed. It was heavy. I used a hand truck to get it in the house, and the walmart employee to load it in my car....I unloaded it from the box...cut the tape and wam bam...i have a mattress. It's very nice and you'd never know it came in a box. My boyfriend and I slept on it a couple nights ago and its very comfy . I think anyone would be happy with it.",5
3/8/2017,Brought this bed for my son in a twin size and he loves it very soft and comfortable.,5
8/16/2016,Will recommend it to anyone Thanks,5
4/26/2020,They arrived! They are perfect. Waiting on cutom fitted sheets to arrive.,5
1/15/2024,"I would say if you're gonna get this mattress on an upholstered bed frame, make sure you either already have a box spring or get one. With a box spring too, the mattress just becomes so much more comfortable. My dad and I were honestly so shocked when it came rolled up and vacuum sealed. But all we had to do was cut the seal open and let it air out so the mattress could ya know, be more of a mattress lol. But now I'm in love with it. Compared to my old mattress that was so much thicker, this helps my back so so much and it's money well spent. My cats love my new bed as they sleep with me, and everyone that has laid on it loves it as well.",5
1/9/2024,I ordered a full size mattress. It came well packaged. I was able to get it upstairs and onto the bed frame. A quick snip to open the plastic and poof…..there it was! It inflated itself very quickly and I was surprised at how comfy it is! I purchased it for my teenage grandson to sleep on when he visits. He liked it very much. I would recommend!,5
10/21/2022,I am so happy with this purchase.  The quality is so good and full size is perfect. Delivery was so fast and on time.. Hassle free ..,5
12/5/2023,"My mother spent $400 plus on a mattress from Macy's, which then had to be returned for a different one. The second one still didn't work. The main problem was that the mattresses from Macy's had a huge pillow tops which made the bed rounded on the top, super tall and they seemed easy to roll out of! This is a straightforward mattress it's flat on the top, and very comfortable. There are no springs or other things poking out (like I did experience with another less expensive mattress..)
Don't buy this if you want a really tall mattress, but if you want a comfortable, low mattress - which is firm - this one is perfect!",5
11/19/2023,"I am very please with this mattress. This is my first time trying any mattress without a box spring.
The amount of comfort and quality shocked me.
It came quick and fit very well on my queen size frame. I rested very well on this mattress and will purchase another for my other empty bedroom.",5
12/11/2023,"A great bed without spending a lot of money.   Im so glad I purchased this from Walmart as they had the best price compared to other sites. The delivery was so fast that i was not prepared 😅 for it. Once all the plastic wrapping was taken out, the bed inflated to its original size within minutes. I have Zinus mattresses in all three of my bedrooms and absolutely love them.",5
11/10/2023,"Very happy with this purchase. It's really hard to find mattresses at a low cost that aren't memory foam which I feel a lot of people don't find that comfy.. this is definitely not the same quality as a $1000 mattress but for a guest room to a bed that won't get regular nightly use out it, it's pretty great quality. Throw a mattress topper on top for some extra coziness and I think it's will be a big hit with guests",5
11/12/2023,"Was really surprized with the Zinus Quilted 8"" mattress. Needed a mattress fast at a bargain price. I figured at this price if it lasted a year would be happy. My son who has back problems was skeptical when it arrived in a box, but is very happy with it and how comfortable it is. It inflated amazingly quick. He slept on it 24 hours later without as much pain. It appears to be of good quality and he says he sleeps better than on my $800. brand name mattress.  There wasn't any odor to it. Would definitely recommend this mattress.",5
11/17/2023,"I bought this on sale - and it is a fabulous value.  I like a firm mattress - better for my back - and this one is firm.  I did add a foam topper for comfort.  When it arrived it opened up very quickly and I was able to sleep on it the same night.  I did not notice any smell, but I opened it in a well ventilated room anyway.  
I would agree that the edges are soft - I think that is the construction.  There is not metal or wire in the edges like in a traditional mattress.  But I don't sit on the edge of the bed, so I don't care.  It does not affect sleeping on it in anyway.  
As for size - I bought a full and it fills out full sheets very nicely. So I don't see that it is any smaller than a traditional full size mattress. I put it on a frame...",5
11/19/2023,After reading the reviews I decided to take a chance on these mattresses for my new bunk beds and I'm glad I did it fits comfortably on the bed slacks it inflates in a matter of minutes and very comfortable I even received a discounted price  well worth the investment especially if your on a tight budget I bought the twin size mattresses and would purchase another if need. Great job manufacture good quality,5
12/13/2023,"I almost bought this on Amazon, only see the price climb 50% in a week (?). The Bidenflation never ends. The good news is that this mattress is a bargain on Walmart. It shipped fast, and inflated super-quick to its advertised height, and had no smell at all. It does reek of quality though! The mattress is on the firm side, but not too hard. It compares favorably with my much more expensive Simmons Beautyrest mattress. Best online purchase I've made in a while!",5
5/20/2014,I was a little worried about ordering a mattress offline but everything worked out fabulous! I ordered a full size. The bed is firm and comfortable. Shipping was quick not to mention the price for the bed was unbeatable!! :) I totally recommend,5

Bed is firm but soft at the same time, great body support! Highly recommend!",5
1/5/2024,"For an inexpensive mattress, I wasnt expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised when I found this bed more comfortable than the serta and sealy mattresses I've had in the past. It's a bit softer than I'd expected, but thats perfectly fine.",5
1/19/2024,We bought this for our daughters bottom bunk and then later ordered a new mattress in a box for our bed so we had to sleep on the bottom bunk. We were well rested,5
3/19/2017,Bed immediately inflated as soon as I started unwrapping it. I am so pleased with this thing. The regular king size is perfect. I feel like I'm floating when I lay on it. Very supportive and no issues with sheets sliding/popping off like I've had with mattresses in the past. I would post a picture of it but that would require me getting out of it to do so...and well I'm enjoying my day off laying in it right now so just take my word for it that it's great.,5
4/7/2014,"WHEN I PICKED UP THE BOX AT WALMART I THOUGHT WHAT HAVE I DONE?
SO I OPENED THE BOX IT WAS A STURDY BOX AND THE BED WAS WRAPPED TIGHTLY IN A SYNTHETIC COVER. I DID READ THE INSTRUCTIONS AND UNROLLED IT OUT IN THE LIVING ROOM SO I HAD A LOT OF ROOM TO LET IT EXPAND. IT WAS FLAT, REALLY FLAT, SCAREY FLAT.
I WONDERED IF IT WOULD BE AS SOFT AS SOME SPONGY FOAM WITH NO SUPPORT. I CUT THE SEALED BAG AND THE AIR RUSHED IN AND IT EXPLODED INTO A REAL BED. I PUSHED ON IT AND JUST LIKE THEY SAID IT HAD SUPPORT SPRINGS. SO FOR 2 DAYS IT SAT IN THE LIVING ROOM FLOOR STILL IN THE PLASTIC BAG/COVER TO KEEP IT CLEAN AND I THINK IT TOOK A DAY TO COME TO ITS FULLY EXPANDED SELF. NOW WAS THE TEST WITH A PILLOW I LAID DOWN ON IT AND WAS SURPRISED HOW COMFORTA...",5
6/21/2016,"I bought this mattress for a bed in our guest bedroom. The quality, appearance and level of comfort is totally outstanding. The mattress was delivered in a box and was shrink wrapped. It took literally not time at all, once opened, to lay flat.  I am very impressed with this brand and the overall quality. The next time I or anyone I know has a need for a mattress I will definitely recommend this brand.",5
10/31/2016,I ordered a Twin and a Queen size mattress and they are great! The first night I slept on it I was not pleased and noticed I didn't follow the directions in allowing it to expand for 48 hours. The second night I slept on the mattress it was firm and I slept very well.,5
8/8/2016,"My daughter was needing a new mattress really badly but had no money nor a way to haul one, so I decided to give this a try.  SCORE!  She thinks the mattress is totally awesome and it was delivered right to the front door!  Wonderful all the way around!",5
9/4/2023,"I loved the mattress! It's very comfortable and I'd say it's medium in terms of softness: not too soft, but not too firm, just perfect. The mattress comes in a box, which is very convenient, and it was easy to get it back to mattress form. I recommend this purchase! :)",5
3/18/2017,"After reading several positive reviews about this product I decided to purchase it; hoping it was as good as the review claims. I love the king mattress and am totally satisfied with my purchase! I wake up now feeling completely rested! No more back pains. My biggest concern was if the mattress would be firm enough, however, it has exceeded all my expectations! It also comes in great packaging and is easily handled. I recently purchased another, twin size, same brand, and again, very satisfied with the quality. I highly recommend this mattress and company",5
7/26/2016,Pulled it out of the box and thougt I got a futon by mistake. As soon as I unwrapped it and placed it on the frame it started making scary sounds. I popped the plastic around it...BAM! Instant bed. Took about a day to fill out but was worth it. Great matress and worth what I paid for it.,5
2/5/2013,"Im deployed in Afghanistan. I have gone thru 3 BAD military issue mattresses in 2 months. Since WalMart offered free shipping, I compared 5 mattresses. The Slumber 8"" Mattress in a box, won by providing a 5 year warranty. It arrived very quickly! Quickly set up & able to sleep on that night! I have not slept better while here. I am thinking of buying a queen size for Home when I get back!

10/27/2016,"I was a little skeptical to buy a mattress compressed into a small box.......but figured ""what to lose""? it shipped fast and free. Took it out and placed on my box spring.......cut the straps and BOING! It puffed up like a banty rooster and filled right up! They did a good design job to get the springs and coils to lay flat I tell you! Jack Russell dog jumped right up and gave it his approval. Wife flopped on it and proclaimed instant love! Best $150 buck I've spent in a long time! Try it, don't like it, Walmart will take it back! $150 well spent!!!!!!",5
2/25/2017,"When the mattress was delivered, I have to admit that I was so upset looking at the unopened box. When I opened the box, I was amazed at how the mattress was able to be literally shrink wrapped into a flat square. it was flattened to about 1.5 inches.  Once I cut the shrink wrap off, the mattress rose to the occasion!  When I placed the mattress on the bed and laid on it... WOW!  This is a great mattress, very comfortable for any kind of sleeper in my opinion.  As well as this mattress sleeps, I would have expected the price to be more.  If you are wondering if you should buy this mattress, yes, go on ahead and buy it.  You will not regret it!",5
5/25/2013,"Skeptical when I received it in a very compact box. Rolled up, and sealed tightly in plastic.
once I broke the vacuum, this was tighter and stiffer than the original mattress it replaced. My daughter loves it. And yes, it has inner springs. Great choice for us for sure.",5
11/23/2013,"I finally broke down and ordered this mattress after several months of debating on it. I had been experiencing lower back pain as well as disruptive sleep on the older mattress I had been using, and usually woke up very stiff with tight muscles and my joints aching in the morning. I knew I needed a new mattress, but was also on a tight budget.

After reading several positive reviews on this product, I decided to go ahead and order a full size mattress. I was pleased from the start! I never expected a mattress ""in a box"" would be so comfortable! The very first night I slept on it, I woke up with NO back pain whatsoever. I knew my prior mattress had been old, but never expected a new mattress would provide me with so much pain relief AND a be...",5
10/22/2023,"This was a great way to get mattresses for a bunk bed.  They arrived quickly, delivered to my door. I opened them beside the bed and then just slid them on.  The covers are very plain, a white fabric with no design.  I always use a mattress protector anyway, so that didn't bother me.    They were thick enough to use without a box spring on the bunk platform.  I found them comfortable to lie on, although they are planned for my grandkids who will love them I'm sure.",5
10/25/2023,"Iordered this mattress for a full size bed. It came quicker than expected. It fits perfectly, no weird smells or squeaky. It feels like it has a pillow top. Its great quality for the price. I highly recommend this mattress and will be purchasing again for guest room.",5
8/13/2014,"Slept on this mattress for a week now, and it was a great buy. My old mattress was 26 years old, so when I got the ad for this mattress in my email from Walmart.com, I decided to check it out. It got to my house in 3 days without any extra shipping charge. GREAT

The mattress came in an easy handling box and uncompressed perfect. There was a video to watch that was very helpful.",5
9/17/2023,WHEN MY MATTRESS CAME  IN WHICH WAS FAST! I WAS A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS UNTIL I OPEN THE BOX( PLEASE DONT CUT YOUR MATTRESS AFTER TAKING IT OUT OF THE BOX OR THE PLASTIC UNFOLD THE PLASTIC!😁) NO I DIDNT CUT MY MATTRESS…..THE MATTRESS IS BIG AND SOFT AND FIRM AT THE SMAE TIME BUT SOFT!! I ENJOY SLEEPING ON IT AND WILL PURCHASE THIS ITEM AGAIN I ENJOY MY REST WELL!!! Zickzack,5
10/3/2023,I was hesitant to get rid of my old bed but it was time. This was my first experience with bed in a box but I'm very pleased. It arrived in 2 days and pluffed up as soon as I cut into the plastic. It's firm but soft because it's a hybrid with foam and springs. I recommended it to several relatives.,5
10/15/2023,"I love this mattress it's so comfortable I brought it twice! It has a pretty, quilted pillow top, it's firm but not too firm, great for kids/young adults or adults who like a semi-firm/softish bed. The designs on the quilted pillow top are pretty, I brought it for my kids; you can't feel the coils!",5
2/10/2014,"Slept on a memory foam mattress for a year and a half, my back has never felt right since. This mattress was delivered in two days, I was amazed that it fit into a box. I haven't slept this great for awhile and I have no more back and neck pains after waking up. I use this with a platform bed and no box spring. Only complaint is that that it doesn't completely fill out my bed as much as the memory foam, and might be a little lower in height, but it's still great nonetheless.",5
8/7/2011,"We purchased this mattress along with the ""Spa Sensations Smart Bed Frame"" because our seven year old set had started causing us back problems in the morning. It stays put on the frame, and is the most comfortable mattress we have found, at any price. It is both supportive and sink-in soft because of the pocket-coil construction with the foam layered on top of it. The sides are ""soft"" -meaning no hard cord digging into your legs if you sit down on the edge, but there is no ""sliding off"" feeling. VERY impressed with this mattress, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a decently priced, comfortable bed.",5
2/2/2012,"I had a rather expensive air chamber mattress but my dogs chewed the hoses which made it a bad fit for us. I have a memory foam topper so bought this mattress to replace the adjustable air chamber mattress. Because of the price, my expectations were pretty low. I really was amazed at the comfort and quality. I would definitely recommend this.",5
5/17/2013,"This is the third Slumber 1 - *"" mattress in a box we have purchased !!! Both our children have the full size and we recently purchased a queen size for our trailer at camp !!!!! would highly recommend to anyone looking for a super comfortable mattress !!!!",5
10/30/2013,"When the box arrived I thought ""how is a full sized mattress in this box""? I just knew it would be flat and useless. It unrolled and returned to it's original size with no bent up corners. The mattress is just firm enough for someone with back issue but still very comfortable. I'd buy it again and suggest it to friends in the market for a reasonably priced, comfortable mattress.",5
1/27/2013,"I would highly recommend this product. I didn't expect much when I order this product because it showed a small box that the air was compressed from the mattress. When you open this mattress it really fluffs up but not hard not soft but perfect. I love it.
Do not underestimate the size of this box....it is heavy and I had a job getting it up to the second floor. The only problem I see with this bed is if you had to return it, how would you ever compress the air out of the bed to put back in the box. I will not be returning mine because it is too comfortable.",5
2/22/2017,"Absolutely one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on. I purchased this for my daughter who has had sore back issues every morning. The morning after she slept on this bed, she commented how she was pain-free. This was after a tough two-day move-in into a third floor apartment after a 5 hour road trip! When you roll over, no movement of the mattress. Amazing pillow-top cushion that is soft but supportive at the same time. I would recommend this mattress to anyone. Easy to move, fun to open and watch it ""expand"" and a pure dream to sleep on. Also, easy to order, fast delivery and great price. Don't even hesitate - buy it. The over 4,000 ""excellent"" reviews are all true.",5

I'm not sure about how long it will last, but so far all is well...",5
9/2/2023,"Bought my first  mattress 2 1/2 years ago. It is very comfortable, I highly recommend.  I sleep on this mattress everyday. It is on the medium firmness, if you prefer something more softer, then this will not be for you.  I have a bad back and needed something cheap and medium firmness.  Liked it so much, I have bought 4 in the last 3 years for the kids.",5
6/15/2016,"I purchased a single twin size mattress.  Given that this was a mattress in a box at a very low price, I didn't let my expectations get way out of hand.  My primary concern was whether the mattress would be firm and supportive enough. Another concern I had was wanting a product that had no obvious manufacturing smell.  I bought a futon once (not from Walmart) that had a terrible chemical smell, and I eventually discarded it.  One main reason I wanted a mattress in a box was so that I could bring it home myself and carry it into the bedroom myself.  Local stores charge 25.00 just for delivering a mattress.  First, I found the mattress perfect for me  in terms of  support.  Now,  I'm a female, 5 ft. 7ish, 170 pounds, so judge accordingly.  I ...",5

I ordered the full size for him and purchased the most inexpensive basic box springs to put underneath it at a local store. All I can say is WOW what a NICE Mattress, especially for the price. I don't think you would need a box springs if you had a higher bed frame. It inflated to its full height almost immediately, but I still gave it 24 hrs. before I put the bedding on it. Was a little on the firm side at first, until it was slept on a couple of times, but I personally like a firm mattress. My son had been sleeping on a broken down mattress and box springs that was supposed to have a 5 year...",5
11/16/2013,"I read all of the reviews before I ordered the mattress and I was not disappointed. I ordered a twin mattress for my guest bedroom and it came sooner than I expected and sooner than the time frame stated on the order receipt. By the way, shipping was free. Do not open the box with a box cutter...you risk cutting through the mattress because it is shrink wrapped. After you open the box and remove the tape the mattress is wrapped in a brown burlapish material. You will have to unroll the mattress, remove the plastic covering and air will immediately fill it up. I recommend that you Lay it out flat on the floor for a day before using it. Also recommend that you purchase a box spring if you don't have one already. Some of the other reviewers st...",5

10/26/2016,"We had purchased 2 of these mattressses, twin size..both arrived together and on time, in separate boxes. They come rolled, must be given time to breath and expand, not sure on recommended time for this, we waited 6 hours and our kiddos slept better than ever. They're very nice and thick! Almost pillow top like..my husband and I had tried laying on them during he expanding process and we both agreed that we really need to get a larger size for our bed in the near future. Purchased February of 2016, still amazing. Our kids have no complains of springs hurting them, you'd think it's a memory foam mattress, the plush top really gives the feel of a non-spring mattress. Highly recommend!",5
8/10/2016,I took a leap on ordering 2 of these mattresses for my boys after a horrible fail with the ones I brought from Ikea. Never expected these to be so comfortable. The day I got them they came right to there full size within minutes and two days later my boys they had the greatest night sleep in over a month.,5
1/28/2014,"I was a bit hesitant at first but, when I received it rolled up my mother laughed at me and said that's not a mattress. I got it for myself and my toddler to sleep on. After unrolling it and letting it inflate. (It's not like an air mattress at all). I placed it on a box spring only words I can say is that, I completely knock out when I lay on this mattress. It's a good firm and cushioning mattress. I bought a queen size. It was worth every cent of my money. You don't have to purchase a 900 dollar bed mattress to sleep good. It saves money and sleeps great. After my mother ask me where is the flimsy roll up mattress I bought I told her she was laying on it. She was shocked, she was even more shocked when she fell asleep on it and said this ...",5
9/26/2023,At first I was scared to buy it because I thought it would be to thin or too short. I'm 5'2 and I can fit comfortably on this bed. It's true to size and you also can keep it in the plastic if you would like and it's easy to open. I will definitely be buying this mattress again !!,5
9/20/2023,"It came in a very heavy box, and it immediately inflated as soon as you cut open the plastic. I had to sleep on it the same night because i had no other option, and I noticed that the side where I slept for the next week never inflated fully. I then rotated the mattress, and the other half was perfect. I also noticed that the indent I made in the first few days completely went away. It of course depends on your sleeping preferences, but I am really enjoying this mattress. Had to buy it as a ""cheap"" (compared to other queen mattresses) furnishing option, but definitely not uncomfortable!",5
5/24/2016,"We liked this mattress enough to come back three times for it! In terms of value, it can't be beat. The mattress is comfortable--very firm, but comfy. Also, I really loved the ease of getting it in the house. It arrives in a big box that my husband simply carried to the room we wanted it in and we unrolled it onto the box spring. So much easier than borrowing a friend's truck and hauling a huge mattress! Now, these mattresses were all purchased for my children, ages teenager and down. For an adult, particularly a heavier person, I don't think this would be the best option unless you are strapped for cash and can't afford a better one yet. If I sit on the edge of the mattress is crushes down quite a bit (I weigh 130), but that is just the ed...",5
3/29/2017,"The mattress was delivered in 2days as stated when the order was submitted.  It was shipped in a relatively small box and was very easy to unpack.  We let the mattress unfold and reach its proper shape and size as instructed by NOT sleeping on it for 48hrs (2days)- we bought a twin size.  So far, the mattress meets all our expectation; 8"" (true to size), firm yet very comfortable, color and look exactly as pictured.  I would buy the same mattress in another size when/if we need another one.",5

10/14/2014,"This mattress was even better than what I was expecting.
My husband has a really bad back, has a few herniated discs and our old mattress was killing him.
He's been very happy with this mattress, it firm, comfortable and has a 10 year warrenty. Plus, it's a little closer to the ground, which makes getting out of the bed easier.
I would definitely recommend this to a friend and you can NOT beat the price.",5

I received it 2 days earlier than stated. Package was a little heavy but really not hard to handle. Fit into the back of my explorer easily. It can fit into the backseat of a car easily, unless you drive a compact. The instructions are on the flap when you open the box from the proper end and inside taped to the package.

I was looking for a cheap mattress for a child's bed and being a single mom without a truck, when I found out they sold a mattress in a box I was relieved that at least one obstacle was out of the way. After shopping around, I decided to give this mattress a go.

I am so glad I did!!

It was convenient to get home, easy to set up, is very nice to look at (albeit a little cheap-y looking, but nothing sheets won't cover up!) AND it's a pretty solid mattress.

I've tried it myself and it's so nice to not feel any springs in your back or hear any noise from the mattress.

It's so comfy and I don't wake up hurting in my hips anymore and feel well rested when I wake up. I used to wake up like at 11 or 12, but since having this mattress I wake up at 8 or 9 feeling refreshed. It's amazing how much of a difference  there is going from an older worn out mattress to this new one as far as ur body feels. And it's a great price, shipping was faster than expected. If I could give this mattress rating more stars I would. It'd simply amazing!",5

My old mattress was from a high end furniture retailer and was like sleeping on a board after the first 3 years, and a spring popped out sideways through the wall of the mattress. This mattress is perfect just the way it is but since my other one was so uncomfortable I bought 1 1/2 inch memory foam and a waterproof mattress topper just to make it bearable.

Be prepared to struggle a bit when cutting thru the plastic that it's wrapped in (it's thick and form-fitting).  Also, it wants to straighten out once released.  
It opened to about 4-5"" deep.  Not to worry, it was at the full 8"" by the time I put it on the daybed.  
It fit perfectly.  Such comfort!  
PS. Its firm, not EXTRA firm.",5

Very sturdy, no movement at all! I got this with the Linus 8 inch mattress, I have had the best sleep of my adult life for under $400 total for a King sized bed.",5
9/19/2016,"When you remove the outer wrapper, it slowly unrolls and grows into a full mattress.  After about an hour it was ready to use.  Very comfortable, fit perfectly on my platform bed.  The outer surface is a little slippery, so it works best with a mattress cover to keep the sheets from sliding around.   Great mattress for the price!",5
9/13/2013,"Who would think that a mattress rolled up and shipped in a box would be comfortable? This mattress is comfortable and very well constructed, it is firm yet doesn't hurt your back. I have been seeing a doctor for low back and knee problems, since sleeping on this mattress these problems have eased up.",5
6/27/2016,"I must admit I was sceptical about this purchase and did not know what to expect. to my surprise it was an excellent purchase I made. the mattress took very little time to totally inflate to where it should be and I was able to sleep on it that very night. It is firm and very comfortable-I cannot handle soft mattresses. 
Even though I had read about odors this one had none at all. I bought the full size as that is all that I need at this time but if the time comes to get a larger size I definitely will.
I had bought the flex platform bed frame to go with this and the fit is perfect--no need for box springs",5
10/13/2023,"Ordered this for my college age daughter and she likes it so much that I ordered it for the other one still at home who also needed a new mattress. She loves it just as much. very comfortable and great price point!
A year later and the kid at college still loves her mattress",5
3/21/2017,"I bought a full size and a twin size for a bunk bed.  both exceed my expectations.  It is really more firm than i expected.  unboxing it is a wonder to see.  How they get that full size mattress in that box is magical.
I am setting a house up as an AirB&B and I will be buying more of these.",5
1/26/2014,"That is the reason I purchased it on the advice of my chiropractor. I did not want to purchase a whoe new bebroom suite, and was put off by the price of matresses. The fact that this one was vacumn packed and blew up while in the frame was ideal and that feature alone was reason enough to purchase it but the price tag sold me.

This mattress was as comfortable as any I've slept in, and reviews said that for a big woman as myself it would sink to the bottom, but I didnot find this so, and I've had it a few weeks already. Time will tell.

one word to the wise Give it a full 24-48 hours to fully open up. This may be the reason that others have had a problem. This is the only thing I can figure out that peple gave some horrid reviews. (that or ...",5
12/16/2015,"Best purchase and delivery ever! I have been sleeping on a queen size airbed for over two years and desperately needed a positive change. With some good research I decided to take the plunge and upgrade to a king size bed. I haven't slept this well in almost two years! I am so thankful to have a comfortable, affordable bed.",5
5/1/2011,"I bought a twin size for my guest room. I already had the frame $59 from Walmart, no box spring needed. I had it shipped to my local Walmart (ship to store) for free shipping. The total for the mattress was $200. It came in a box 40"" x 17"" x 17"" and weighed about 45 lbs. It was easy to move it from the cart to the car trunk, no lifting, just some maneuvering, and I had to bungie cord the trunk shut.
I dropped (nothing can break!) the box out of the trunk unto the ground and used a dolly to bring it into the house.
The reason I am telling you all of this is because I had questions whether I could pick it up at the store or pay for shipping to my house. Everything was EASY!!
Once I got it in the house, I removed the box (do not use a box cutt...",5
10/24/2023,"I purchased this mattress in twin size to replace an older one for my mother. It arrived promptly; no damage. It was throughly sealed. I took it out of the box, rolled it out flat onto the floor in its wrapping, and sliced around the plastic so it could properly puff up. Within a few hours, I would say it was fully to the correct height. However, I still waited until the next day to fully unwrap it; because I was waiting for a mattress encasement to arrive for it. When my mother slept on it that  night, I got a text the following morning saying she felt she was “sleeping on a cloud!”",5
5/7/2011,"I bought this for my 16 year old and I will admit I was a bit apprehensive about buying a mattress online. When we went to pick it up at the store, they brought out a box the size of a childs toy box and I was very unsure. We got it home and opened it up to find they compressed and vacuum sealed it, folded it in half and rolled it up. I thought for sure this was gonna be bad. I was wrong. We opened it up and put it on the bed and it is more comfortable then the pillow-top matress on my bed(and I paid more than twice the cost of this one). My daughter loves it and we are very pleased. We are planning on buying another for our younger child!",5
10/20/2023,It's so comfortable soft but not to soft as to where your sinking. My kids use to complain about their beds and would end up in mine but now they sleep later and fall to sleep quicker and the fact that I didn't need box springs for it was definitely an A  type of thing.. love it!!,5
3/25/2013,"I really wasn't expecting much being the cost wasn't high. Boy was I wrong! Great bargin! I had a 4"" memory foam topper that I put on top. I also bought the metal base to put it on eliminating the need for a boxspring. This set up rivals an expensive set up.",5
2/4/2014,"I was a bit skeptical (and curious) about a ""bed in a box"". It arrived in a cardboard box that was only about 3'x3'. I opened the box and laid it out as per instructions. When I cut the straps it unfolded into normal mattress shape. The instructions advise it could take up to 48 hours to expand to full, normal size. However, mine was ready to sleep on in minutes. It is one of the most comfortable mattresses I have slept on. I have only had it a few weeks but so far it is still most pleasing to use. I am extra-large (350+).",5
12/28/2013,"This was purchased as a spare bed for when we have overnight company which is not that often so I was not looking to spend a whole lot of money. Well, I got way more than my moneys worth with this mattress. We purchased the spa sensations bed frame at the same time and it was a breeze to set up. My husband who is 70 has difficulty sleeping due to knee pain and would get up many times during the night and either lay on the sofa or recliner, now he goes to the guest bed and stays there all night without getting up until morning. According to him its more comfortable than our $1800 Sterns & Foster King size pillow top mattress and coming from my picky husband that is quite a compliment.",5
2/20/2017,"It's a good firm bed. This is the 3rd time I've bought one of these beds; 2 kings and 1 queen. The queen is in our guest room and we haven't had any complaints from our guests, some have even said they've slept better than at home. This is the 2nd one for the king bed in our room, after about 1-1 1/2 years it breaks down and is no longer firm enough for our liking so it had to be replaced. Can't complain about the life span with how cheap they are compared to others. Comes in a decent sized box shrink wrapped and once it's released it 'grows' to whatever size you purchased. We have always let them sit for at least 4 hours to 'grow' before laying on it. No terrible smells or any other issues. It's a simple, firm mattress.",5
4/11/2013,"I was skeptical about a buying a bed in a box. But, I read all the reviews and took a chance and bought this mattress with the smart base frame. You're not supposed to need a box spring with it so i didn't buy a box spring.
I couldn't be happier! I'm amazed at how comfortable this bed is! My mattress is actually a little over 8"" thick and there is wonderful memory foam in there. The top feels like a high quality, firm, but soft to the touch quilt.
Seriously! I tried a sleep number bed at the mall recently worth thousands of dollars and I can't believe this slumber mattress is more comfortable! It's sooo worth every single penny!
I have back and neck problems, and I sleep like a baby on this bed and wake up without the aches I use to get. I ...",5
3/20/2017,I purchased this product roughly a 3 weeks ago. I was amazed at the quality for the price. Nice & plush plus it's very comfortable.  a medium firmness to it and the kids love it. Easy out of the box setup. Let it sit out for 48 hours to fluff and air out.,5
9/17/2023,After the 48 hour so it could decompress I put it on the bed put sheets on it and it was the best night's sleep I had in a long time. to be truthful I don't remember going to sleep. The Old mattress that I had I paid twice as much then I paid for this one. and it's a 100% difference between the two mattresses. I was a little skeptical when I seen the price but I'm so glad that I decided to buy it.,5
9/6/2016,"After sixteen years of marriage and five kids, we decided it was time to upgrade our bed to a king size mattress. We had continually put off this purchase because of the cost of buying a new one. A month or so ago, my sister recommended this mattress from Walmart. When she told us how inexpensive it was compared to most of the mattresses on the market, I was skeptical–but also very interested! In the end, we decided to purchase the mattress because we needed a king bed, we couldn't beat the price, and we figured that worst case scenario it would last a couple of years and then possibly need to be replaced.

While I can't comment on the longevity of the mattress, in the three weeks we have owned it we have been extremely pleased for the foll...",5
3/25/2017,I purchased the mattress a little over a month ago. I mindfully wanted to wait atleast 30 days before I gave my review. The package did not arrive at the original delivery date which was unexpected because I never received an update w/ a change in the delivery date until late that same day at night.  The original delivery date was a Friday and it came on a Tuesday  ( Walmart gave me a gift card on there own accord for the delay.. not bad at all ) Now the mattress comes to life as soon as you set it free... The mattess is much better quality then I honesty expected because of the price. It is a Great Quality soft but firm mattress if that makes sense. I sleep great on the mattess... The mattess is exactly what it is described to be.,5
3/22/2020,"Omgggg!!!!! This is so nice for the price. I was worried for the price it wouldn't be that great, boy was I wrong. It said to allow the 24 hours to fully recover but only took about 5 min. The bed is super comfy and soft! Best Buy from Walmart.. so great I logged on to make my first review. Thank you! And the warranty is a bonus!",5
2/16/2024,I have the twin in my second bedroom.  I got the fullsize for the main one.  Once again I am a happy customer.  Best night sleep ever.,5

11/18/2023,"The bedding feels soft, was easy to bring up my room and get it set up. My fiance and I are definitely happy with this buy, I can finally sleep better.",5
11/2/2023,Arrived on time.  I followed all directions and within seconds the mattress expanded.  Much to the horror of my cats!!  I will give it another day to get set up and then redo my bedroom.,5

11/2/2023,"I love the kung fu kick of unrolling. inside joke, It love the feel and the firmness of the mattress, but it still has 24 hrs before its completely decompressed. Overall love and recommend this mattress. No matter the price its worth it.",5
12/11/2023,"I was pleasantly surprised with this mattress. It's very firm and inflated nicely. The instructions say to open it within 72 hours of delivery to ensure full inflation, but I kept mine in the box for 2 weeks. I'm very happy with it!!",5
12/8/2023,This bed is really comfortable. We bought it for our 5 year old and are about to order one for our 3 year old. Great price and quality. I can sleep comfortably on it too. Definitely recommend,5

10/29/2023,I can feel the springs thou the bed. It's hard not what you think that describes here. Maybe next time I will spend more money on another bed that cost more.But shipping was fast and on time !,5
11/3/2023,I bought this mattress on sale for our guest room for $98. I slept on it last night because of my husbands snoring. So so comfortable. I 10/10 recommend,5
12/21/2023,The mattress came earlier then expected.  Easy to unfold take out of plastic and watch it pump up to size. with the frame I bought you do not have to use platforms with it. But I had some already.,5
11/23/2023,"Pleasantly surprised.  This is a firm mattress which is what I was looking for. Great quality and comfortable. This is my first time buying a mattress in the box, will definitely buy again.",5
11/26/2023,I was very pleased with this mattress. It is very comfortable. It is in a room for guests but I napped on it and it was great. Soft top and spring support.,5
11/18/2023,"This is not really a hybrid bed, but the springs are very comfortable and quiet and I would buy it again it's a little softer than I thought it was going to be but I still love it!!",5
12/14/2023,My grandson needed a new and a size bigger. I ordered a platform bed and this mattress. He went up from a twin for him and his lab. They're both a lot more comfortable!,5
11/3/2023,This is the second purchase of this mattress. Bought it for the guest bed.  If you like a firm mattress its a good one.  Cant beat the price when on sale,5

Recommend to my mom who has been complaining about body pain and suggested she purchase",5

9/23/2023,I bought this for my 5 year old (shes too tall for her age and it made sense to skip the toddler bed) %26 she loves it. it's really comfortable. You cant feel the springs or anything. Worth every penny!,5
8/15/2023,"I bought this for my camper and it was so comfortable I bought one for my daughter who is away at college. She said she slept through the night for the first time since being in her dorm, over a year ago!",5

3/20/2017,When it first arrived in the little box and I pulled it out I thought there was no way this was going to be a good mattress.  After letting if expand I was pleasantly surprised. My daughter loves it!,5

2/10/2018,"I love how it feels when I lie down. Firm so it doesn't sink like the airbed I had to use for a week after I got my taxes back, but also soft enough so when I go to bed I am out for the night. I love it!",5

8/9/2014,"My wife's back got better with this mattress. I thought it a bit hard at first but have gotten used to it
in less than a week. It helping my wife's back is worth the price. We got it for our travel trailer.",5
7/15/2020,"Very happy. Medium firmness (not sinking in soft but not straight firm). 8 inches is good, cant feel like springs etc. Love it for the price. 

If you like medium mattress then you will love it.",5

mattress on top of the car. It has the firmness promised. Simply great",5
9/26/2023,Love the bed super comfy and you just let it rise for 2 days (style or on it the first day) but on the 3rd day it was extra comfy. Arrives in a box and wasn't hard to get through the door — it was wrapped amazing,5

5/16/2023,"I had bought this same mattress in a queen size for our camper. I noticed how well I slept and how my back pain disappeared. So, I decided to replace my $2200 king size mattress in our bedroom. I love it and it was very affordable. I would recommend it to everyone.",5

7/1/2014,"This is the second Slumber 1 Mattress in a box I've ordered. The first I've had for 3+ years now - still super comfortable and supportive. My most recent purchase was for my teen son. He seems pretty pleased.
Mattress set up is easy - make sure the frame is set up before you open the mattress packaging as it begins to expand immediately. Mattress does have a slight unpleasant odor immediately after opening. A quick spray of febreze and the full 24 hours of expanding time cures that.",5
4/5/2014,I have been struggling to find a comfortable mattress that allows me to get a full night of rest. I tried the foam ones but just found them to be too firm. This mattress is a perfect balance between plushness and firmness. I would highly recommend it.,5
4/28/2013,"I was amazed to find this type of mattress so cheap at Wal- Mart .com. The cheapest mattress at my local furniture store was 3 times as much as this mattress and it was just a regular spring mattress. This mattress is so comfortable and very cheaply priced for the quality. I would definitely recommend that you get this mattress. If you like pillow top mattresses, I saw a mattress like this with a 2 inch pillow top on it for only $20.00 more.",5
1/31/2017,"First mattress we ever bought in a box.  It arrived as promised.  We opened the box, placed it on the bed and removed the wrapping.  Immediately heard a whooshing....sound while the mattress unfolded and started to raise up.  We bought the twin size for a daybed.  Our Granddaughter sleeps on it and says it is ""wonderful"".  It is crazy how it comes in a box then puffs right up.  Per the instructions, we waited 24 hours to sleep on it although I believe it was ready to go in 1-2 hours.  All the good things we heard about this mattress-in-a-box seem to be true.  Also had the lowest price of all mattresses we researched.",5
5/13/2020,"Comes compressed in a box. Open it/roll it out, and then cut the edges of the compression wrapping and let it expand for 2 days. Once its ready, the bed is comfy and firm.

Do yourself a favor and buy a good quality bed wrap to zip it up in as well, so the bed will stay good and fresh for years to come.",5
2/5/2015,"This mattress has the best of both worlds, the body contour ability of all foam, and the firmness of coils. I love my all foam mattress, but my daughters hate it. They have no problem with this one, apparently because the coils give enough support while still providing the benefit of the foam softness and ability to contour, somewhat to the body. Everybody's happy!
Delivery and set up couldn't be easier; price is great. It's a win win.",5
12/10/2012,"This is my second one. They are great to sleep on. I had one on my bed and when I moved from FL to MO I sold it with my bedroom set. The friends that bought it say they like it very much. Once settled I ordered another one for my new place. For the comfort and convience you can't beat the price. I use mine every day. There's no way at 63 years young I could handle a full size mattress on my own. I was going for the convience when I bought the first one, but after sleeping on it for 6 months I knew I would have to replace it with the same product when I moved. Always carefull when opening it, but other than that they are the only way to go for comfort.",5
11/5/2016,"This was an early Christmas gift to my daughter and her husband.  The night after they got to sleep on their new mattress, I asked how was it?  My daughter said. ""Oh Momma it was like sleeping on a cloud!""  Thanks for the speedy delivery. Thanks for the way it was packaged so as not to be too huge. Thank you for the on line shopping, it is so very convenient.",5
3/14/2014,"So in a world full of different mattress choices, finding one that works for you can be time consuming and expensive. Sure, you can go to the big box stores and buy a $300 to $1000 plus mattress, pay to get it delivered, and the be full of regrets for the next 10 years. This mattress is just as good as other ""big box store"" brands if not better, and comes directly to your doorstep for free! If you are still reading this, stop reading and click the buy button.",5
9/10/2016,"I am so impressed with this matress. I bought it on sale for $100. It is just as comfortable as a far more expensive matress. I ordered it for a guest. My father in law who has hip issues used it this past weekend and said he slept like a baby. Thinking of ordering anotherone even though I don't really need it. Wonder, wonderful mattress!",5
12/27/2013,"I was a little hesitant to order a mattress online, but was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this very affordable product . It comes rolled in a box for convenient delivery, but expands once unrolled. I was worried that it would not have enough support, but it is actually quite firm and springy. I highly recommend the Slumber 1 and I'm very happy with my purchase!!!",5
3/12/2014,I got one in king size almost 3 years ago & when it came time to get one for my daughter I wanted to get her one so she could sleep in the Spa-Cloud too... That's what we call it. It's not expensive. It won't leave a dent in your wallet. In these economic times budgeting to spend the least & get the best this mattress is a perfect investment. I'm now also getting one for my son who also needs a new mattress. The kids love seeing & hearing it get aired into a mattress filled. My son's Autistic so he had the biggest exitment seeing it fill in. This is definitely something I'd tell all my friends & neighbors. (And I have). You will not regret it.,5
8/25/2013,This is the second Slumber Mattress in a box we have purchased and we have loved them both! The mattress is very comfortable to sleep on. My kids think they are very comfortable! I have slept on the mattress many nights and it is very comfortable. I would definitely buy this again when I need another mattress!,5
10/25/2012,"i was having a severe back probems and have both other mattresses and it didnt help and i decided to let this be the last one i buy, well, my back is feeling SO MUCH BETTER. the first night i feel asleep so fast and it was so comfortable and i didnt even feel my wife get out of bed. well worth the money.",5
10/8/2016,"this is my second purchase, the first one is working out so well and is so comfortable, I decided to replace another bed in the house.  I will be purchasing a queen size within three months. Very comfortable especially with the frame   I purchased as a set.",5
10/8/2014,I bought this mattress for my elderly mother and she just loves it. Very comfortable and it was easier getting the box this is packed in into the apartment rather than a bulky mattress that I'd have to try to get there in my vehicle. Such a good deal.,5
1/23/2017,Could not believe I could order a mattress in a box. I Live in the country 45 miles from a store with mattresses and do not have a truck.  Thought it over for about 6 months and finally just did it. Ordered Sunday morning about 2am received Monday 4:30 pm. I Have recommended it to many friends. It's GREAT!!!,5
3/22/2017,"Mattress was shipped within 2 days! Perfect firm but soft enough for perfect sleep. I went to a mattress store before purchasing from Walmart.  The mattress at the mattress store had nothing on the one that was delivered from Walmart. Will order again should I need another mattress. Stop reading and go and order. You won't be disappointed, I promise!!",5
10/4/2016,"I bought this mattress for my 9 year old son. I was a little skeptic because of some of the reviews. When it came it was rolled up in a box. I cut the wrapping off and it inflated in less than a minute. It did make it to 8 inches all the way around right away, I know some were having issues there. Even though it inflated right away we let it sit overnight to be sure there were no issues. There was no smell, which was a huge plus for me as my son is asthmatic. It is however a little stiff and my son said it wasn't very comfortable. He is a tiny guy though so to be fair he wouldn't even weigh down a pillow top. It's been a few weeks and it's gotten softer. I did purchase a thin foam topper and he said it's perfect now. Would recommend this to...",5
7/26/2014,"I bought this same exact one for my son 2.5 years ago. It has held up wonderfully and still is like brand new. When my son decided to switch from a single bed to bunk beds, I immediately ordered this one for the second mattress because I loved the first one. I'm still very happy with my purchase of this exact mattress. I would def recommend this mattress to anyone!",5
11/2/2012,"I have to admit that I was presently surprised when I received this mattress!! First it came in kind of a small box and I didn't understand how a queen size mattress would fit in that size box, however, once opened, I discovered that it had been air-packed/sealed and immediately ""sprung"" open once the plastic was cut!! The mattress is actually quite comfortable and am thinking of purchasing a couple of twin size mattresses now!!",5
10/17/2012,I purchased 2 of these mattresses in the twin size and about a little over a year ago I purchased the full sized one. after having my oldest daughter sleep every night on the full size for a year and the bed showed no wear- still as comfy as when we bought it. So we just bought 2 new beds for the other 2 daughters we decided to go with the same kind of mattresses for them.... Just as comfy! good mattresses for the price.,5
4/4/2014,"Very best mattress that we have ever owned! Never again will the over priced sleep shops see us again! We have purchased several mattress's over the last 40 years and this by far is the best! When I think that we spent $1500 for a well known brand mattress that everyone just gloats about I get ill! We were really hesitant to buy this figuring the price was so low what kind of mattress can this be, well I am certainly eating my words because it's wonderful! Not sure how long it will last but for the price if I had to buy a new one every year I would do it! My husband cannot believe how well we both sleep and no more tossing and turning all night to get comfy! Love it! Buy it you will not regret if for a moment! Our backs have not felt this g...",5
2/16/2013,"I love this Mattress, all I had to do was remove the wrapping and up popped my mattress. The mattress arrived 3 days before time, Thank you Wal-Mart. It's only been two weeks, I find the slumber 1 8"" in-the-box Matttess to be very comfy, no problems so far. I would recommened this Mattress to family and friends.",5
7/8/2013,this mattress rocks we were very very skeptical expecially the first day we had it but once it got its air back and firmed up it is the best bed we have slept in since new york new york in vegas the bed feels the same as that 1200 mattress from serta. WE love it its amazing!!! Best bed ever we actually put it on top of our old mattress and box springs and its perfect cant wait to get a real bed frame it will be even better !,5
5/14/2020,Bought in part based off of previous reviews. Shipped quick. Came in box-awesome! When i took mattress out it did smell a little chemically ish but it quickly disappeared by the time the mattress inflated within 2 days. It is soo soft and squishy yet supportive. We put this on a trundle in a kids room and id gladly sleep on it any day! ESPECIALLY for the price! Id buy it again any day. Great price and product!,5
1/1/2014,"After reading countless reviews, my boyfriend and I decided to take the plunge and order this mattress ""in a box."" Don't be fooled by the size of the box it arrives in or the affordable price...this thing really does spring into a regular shape and sized mattress quickly after opening. First, the shipping was lightning fast and cheap. We ordered the Queen size on Sunday and it arrived Wednesday for only about $3 in shipping!

Secondly, comfort. We have slept like babies on this new mattress for 2 weeks now. We couldn't be happier or recommend this mattress more! We still need to get a box spring for it, as it is just laying on the floor right now but even now it is super comfortable and so spacious. I do think this mattress is probably idea...",5
12/22/2016,"I bought this mattress based on research and reviews of prior buyers.  To be honest, I was also trying to save money. This is a great mattress right out of the box. Took about 4 hours to come to proper size after opening. Easy to unpack also. Slept on mattress that night,  very comfortable, no sagging, no noise. I prefer a firm mattress and found this mattress to be just right!
Also bought frame by Smart Spa to support mattress. Works very well, also very little noise with it as well.
Overall, a very satisfying purchase for both mattress and frame.",5
4/29/2012,"I had read other reviews when making my decision to purchase. It is practical economical and sturdy. As a heavy built person, this mattress has so far proven its value and comfort. Ive been sleeping very well on this bed.

I bought the platform bed to go with this. Very sturdy and perfect for the room

I paid for delivery to my home which I am glad I did because it is a very heavy item. DElivery was fast but the Fed Ex guy was annoyed because he had to bring it up a couple of flights.

Site to store delivery is available but if you dont have transport or someone to help you get it into your house take the delivery option. Sweet dreams",5
5/28/2015,I looked all over the place for a mattress for my 17 year old daughter. This is by far the best price I found. My daughter said she sleeps great on it and it has cushion for her back that seems to give her problems. I would recommend to all believe me I looked and this is the best found and better once received and used. Easy to set up comes in a box but does expand to the right size without leaving it bend.,5
3/11/2014,My job calls for me to be on my feet all day. Back and lower back pains were a constant. I had gone through three mattresses trying to get some releif at night. No luck.. Seeing the spring mattress on line and the price I thought I would give this spring mattress a chance. Best investment EVER!. The first night on this mattress I clould feel the differance. Been sleeping like a baby. Thank You Walmart for the mattress and letting me know when the new stock came in. Satisfied and then some!!!!!,5
3/17/2011,"I bought this mattress for my 2 year old to go on his bed (that I also bought from walmart.) And I couldn't be happier! the mattress is VERY COMFORTABLE I was amazed after I had to ""unroll"" it. He loves it! I would highly recommend the mattress to anyone that is in need.",5
11/19/2012,"I bought this mattress for my guest room. I needed something fast, economic with fair quality. No complains so far. It fits its purpose. My husband unpacked it, he said it was a little tricky at first but just needed to be very careful because it is packed very pressurized. Good investment.",5
1/12/2017,"This was the perfect solution! We needed a mattress that we could move to a new location--and not have to rent a truck. It arrived as promised, set up as promised, and so far is comfortable and seems that it will hold up well. Best of all, it was very affordable!",5
7/11/2016,When I first saw these mattresses I wondered how they could be priced so low.  They were rated high by so many people. The bonus for me...2nd day shipping.   That's a rare perk for Hawaii.  So I ordered two! They arrived in exactly two days via FedEx.  The boxes were small.  I would say approximately 3 feet tall and not very heavy. Opening the cardboard box revealed the mattress rolled up in an inner wrap and sealed in plastic.  It was very flat and decompressed.  Once the plastic was removed the mattress inflated to it's normal size in a matter of 1 minute!  Both mattresses are firm and they fit perfectly onto our daybed frame and trundle.  We love them!,5
4/29/2013,This mattress is easily the best investment I have made in a long while. It is absolutely as fine a mattress as those costing several times more. I rate this mattress equal to or better than posturepedic and serta. The firmness is exactly what I wanted and needed. No more back pain in the morning. I awaken refreshed and ready for the day ahead. The look and feel rivals that of the more well known national brands.,5
5/23/2018,"I highly recommend.  Yes I was also very hesitant to purchase a mattress in a box BUT I simply followed the directions allowing it at least a day or more to expand WITHOUT sheets, etc.  You'll be amazed to watch it expand.  End result, this mattress exceeded our expectations.  We purchased 2 for our spare bedroom.  After putting the sheets on we tested their comfort for ourselves.  We both fell sound asleep!",5
8/5/2016,"Our daughter was in need of a replacement mattress so we got this as a temporary one or so we thought. She loves it and we are also getting it for our son and maybe even replacing our king size mattress although not sure if they make it that big?

We did not experience the chemical smell others warned about in other reviews. Works better than more expensive mattresses out there!",5
11/7/2016,"I won't ever buy an expensive mattress again. This one is great and I sleep like a baby. I have it on a slat platform with no box spring. I'm not picky, all I  wanted was a reasonably priced  medium-firm mattress. I was slightly worried when i initially unpacked this. When I pushed my hand into it, it sank a bit like it would be really soft. However, when I lay down and my weight is distributed it's perfect. I would definitely recommend this mattress to others.",5
12/20/2016,Absolutely impressed with the quality of this mattress.  When I first got the box I thought...no way Jose!  But it's air packed and once opened it unfolded wonderfully.  I got this mattress for an adult man and it's worked out great.  So totally worth the money,5
3/30/2014,"Absolutely amazed! Knowing that we needed a new bed, we decided to go this route on the word of a friend. The mattress did have an odor the first 24 hours that kept me from sleeping on it but, since then, I have been able to sleep through the night. I have had 3 major spinal fusion back surgeries and haven't had a full nights sleep in years, (besides the hot flashes, and we ladies know all about how that disturbs sleep) The first morning, I woke up without pain! The mattress is sturdy, and firm but, also soft enough for my husband. If it only lasts 2 years, I'll be happy! Who needs to spend a thousand bucks when these are around!",5
7/25/2013,"Bought a twin for my guest room--rave reviews from all who sleep on it. Fantastic value--and delivered free to my front door! Being able to carry it up two flights of stairs while it was still bound tight and in a box was so much easier than dealing with an open mattress. Wish I had known about this when I bought my own full mattress a few years ago, which cost much more and is not as good a mattress as this new one. I will definitely get the full-sized version of the mattress-in-a-box when the time comes! (And it's so much fun to cut the binding and hear it go ""whoosh!"" as it inflates. Unbelievable how fast it comes to full loft.)",5
9/12/2014,"I read the other reviews about this product and it seemed like a good value for the price. I needed to upgrade my Ikea brand queen bed. My back hurt every morning when I got up, and could barely move. I suspected the mattress on my Ikea bed was to blame. The new mattress fit my frame perfectly. After the first night on this mattress, I woke refreshed and my back felt great!
My order was shipped site to store. Because I wasn't sure how big it would be, I took my truck to pick it up. You don't need a truck. The mattress comes securely packaged in a box that would fit in the back seat of most compact cars. It is a little heavy, so I recommend using a dolly, or getting someone to help you carry it to and from the car. I am on the road right now...",5
1/23/2014,"I read a review prior to buying which stated something like, ""Get it out of the box and BAM!! Instant mattress!"" :) Looks great, feels great and if you like a 'firm' mattress, you'll love this one!

Do be prepared, however. When it's out of the box and the 'ties' are cut, it'll flat JUMP AT YA!! :)",5
3/30/2011,I read all the reviews before purchasing this mattress and felt fairly confident of the quality. I was a little uneasy buying a mattress on line but everything that I read ended up being spot on and it's a great mattress for the price. My daughter loves it and I got a great value! I highly recommend this product!,5
9/23/2015,"Was purchased for an 8 year old boy. It feels very comfortable and he sleeps through the night. Packaging is amazing, starts out about two inches and then inflates to the 8"". Really considering buying a bigger one but not sure how it would work out, but twin size is definitely perfect fit for my children!",5
5/23/2013,If you need a real mattress you cannot go wrong with the mattress-in-a-box. The price is right and it sleeps great.Get one and you will truly be happy you did. The set-up is as easy as the video shows.The product is first rate and walmart as it at a great value.,5
3/29/2021,"I didn't realize the mattress would arrive rolled up in a box. We saw it and groaned, thinking there was no way a tightly rolled mattress was going to be decent quality. We were wrong! It popped right open, fluffed up and we were shocked by how firm and sturdy it was (yet also nice and bouncy for the kids!). Worth every penny- I would highly recommend this.",5
3/10/2021,Bought this bed knowing I'd likely leave it in the house I was living in at the time whenever I moved. It was perfect for the year in that it was very comfy and not expensive. I added a mattress topper to make it a little more squishy and I loved it!,5
6/3/2014,"Bought the Slumber 1 8"" mattress to replace a soft, pillow top that constantly caused back pain, it was too soft....I was skeptical when I picked it up and saw the size of the box it was in (I purchased a Queen size) thought ""What did I buy???"" When I opened it and cut the tape and wrapping it went from 2 inches thick to the 8 inches within minutes...I wake up with no aches and pains and not 5 times a night anymore....What a great product for a great price...I definitely and already have recommended this product to friends...",5
7/24/2016,"Ordered twin size for my 5 yr old, super comfy!  Comes in a box as advertised, delivered right to our door for 5 bux!  open it up, carefully cut plastic off...as soon as plastic is penetrated you can hear it start to puff up. No chemical smell with ours at all!  Super happy with this purchase. Actually can't believe that we got such a great mattress for such a great price. My husband and I have been putting off getting a new mattress due to high cost we've seen at so many other retailers, we will be ordering this same one in a queen for ourselves very soon!  Highly recommend!",5
2/27/2017,Because the mattress comes in a box it is easy to manage when moving it around. For me that was getting it upstairs. This is my 2nd mattress in a box. The 1st one I got for my son 2 1/2 years ago and it is still a good mattress. My Tempurpedic was too hard and had to sell it after sleeping on it for 5 years. When my son left for college I tried his bed and my back stopped hurting so I was sold on getting myself a queen size. Love it.,5
10/19/2014,"We ordered this bed online and had it within a week. We followed the directions with regard to opening the packaging and had a good laugh as we listened to it inflate. We put it in place and allowed it to sit for 24 hours before it was slept on. Our adult son was the first to sleep on it and he absolutely loves the firmness of the bed. It's not a fancy mattress, but it certainly fits the bill for us.",5
5/14/2013,"I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical about buying a mattress that has to ""decompress."" I'm a big guy and was afraid that it might ""recompress"" under my weight. But it does not. I have had back pain most of my life. It seems to come and go. But lately I was waking up each morning with lots of back pain. Honestly I should have replaced my old mattress years ago. But I did not realize that it was the cause of my back pain. Since sleeping on this new mattress I wake up with little or no back pain. I really love this mattress and so does my back.",5
11/27/2023,i love all the mattresses ive purchased thank you for affordable prices my husband goes through them with his dementia he wets the bed alot,5
11/7/2023,I really enjoy how it wasn't to hard to get out of the stuff it was shipped in and put onto the bed and how comfy it is.,5
12/5/2023,Definitely feels like a big pillow %26 thick also if you use to having a brick bed like me your def gone have to get use to it,5
12/18/2023,"It was so easy to unpack. It's perfect for me, I'm so happy that I picked this mattress over one from Amazon.",5
12/23/2023,Easy to assemble! It was a Christmas gift for my 5year old. We all absolutely love it! Great quality and size!,5
12/6/2023,The mattress is so comfortable looking at it now a 10” would have been better . My son says best sleep ever,5
12/19/2023,"brought this mattress for my growing 12 year old and he seems to be sleeping well.

11/12/2023,"It comes in a box, pretty easy to arm (on itself). Its really comfortable and it helps to ease low back pain.",5
11/10/2023,Love thickness (8 inches). Love price. Quick delivery to front door. Able to get twin unpacked and on bed in hour.,5
12/16/2023,Took about a week for it to break in and it's been comfortable ever since. Couldn't say no to the price either.,5
12/18/2023,"After buying mattresses we bought 3 sets. 
This is the best I can finally get rest. People. I'm telling this is great.  Thank you so much.",5
12/11/2023,I like how when you break the vaccum seal it inflats right away. It was much easier then wrestling with the old way mattress %26 box spring.,5
12/1/2023,The bed is comfortable. When I heard there were springs inside of it I was skeptical but it is really comfortable.,5
11/30/2023,"this bed is so great. i was actually surprised by the quality! bought for my daughter, but i might get one for myself. supportive yet soft.",5
11/8/2023,"sleeps great, nice and thick, very affordable...best decision and my son has not complained at all..",5

1/29/2024,"I'd give 0 stars if I could. Paid almost $500 for an Xbox and received a box of Little Debbie treats, and they were even expired. This company needs to be banned from doing business through Walmart. You should be ashamed of yourselves.",1
12/29/2023,"This was the worst experience of my life. Walmart (or antonline, who they apparently outsourced too) sent me a used Xbox that didn't even work with non matching serial numbers of that on the box of that on the actual system, and refused to refund or exchange because of the situation. Literally had a game in the system and the hdmi port was smashed and unusable",1
1/21/2024,This Xbox was priced cheaper for a reason. It was not new. It seems like it was refurbished because the loading was very poor. The Xbox series X I purchased was always slower in loading in every side by side test vs another Xbox series X. This is a bad product and Walmart should be ashamed for hosting the seller. They simply do not care. Never have and never will. This is a rotten company through and through.,1

The driver stole it and took a picture or random parked cars as his proof of delivery while I stood outside waiting for him at my door that he never came to. I ordered from Amazon instead with money I didn't have because although I provided proof of the order never actually being delivered, the refund took 7-10 business days so it wasn't refunded till now (after Christmas). I just ordered groceries (only $16 and some change worth) and thought I would be ok because it's not a big ticket order. Nope, the driver just stole my order AGAIN. First Alexander with the series x and now Jade with my raviolis and sauce. I will be canceling my Walmart plus and not ordering from...",1

You will be charged the higher price!  Complete false advertising from Walmart. Their customer service was unapologetic about the price discrepancy and said it was a glitch.  The glitch has been there over a week! Also the order was placed on Dec. 10th and is not coming until Dec. 17th so now 2 day shipping as advertised either!,1
12/11/2023,I wish I could give negative stars. I will never shop with Walmart again. Ordered for my husband's birthday to be delivered on his birthday and it was never delivered and the picture of the delivery picture was someone holding it in their hands not put on my front porch like it said. Walmart did not care!,1
12/20/2023,"I ordered an Xbox Series X online on 12/11/2023 and I was delivered on 12/12/2023.  I was out of town so when I returned on 12/13/2023, I looked at the package and immediately thought, ""This is not an Xbox.""  When I opened it, it was a Beats Studio Headphones.  So I went to a Walmart to return it (they were kind and professional) and I spoked to a Coach who told me that I was at the incorrect Walmart.  He directed me to go to the Delta Shores Walmart in Elk Grove, California.  I proceeded to drive to that Walmart and spoke to an employee (Mery, she was kind and professional).  She called the Online Grocery Pick-up team and requested a Coach named Nitin, who kept saying that he was on his way and NEVER showed up.  I waited a while and an emp...",1
12/23/2023,"I ordered this as a Christmas gift. Left it in the shipping box which was normal until I had time to wrap it. When I opened the box, the original packaging had been slashed and torn, maybe by a machine. Who at Walmart thought this was ok to send in this condition? This was the “big” special Christmas gift for my boys and now it's ruined.",1
12/17/2023,"Package was severely damaged.  Doubt the unit would have worked. Went to exchange at store. They would not exchange, but would have to issue a credit and I would I have to buy again. The credit would not appear back for a few days. Buy from Amazon or Best Buy.",1
12/28/2023,"Placed order and third party provider Spark delivered to an abandoned home instead of my address. Walmart advised me to take it up with my bank, not their problem since I paid the $5.00 rush delivery.",1
7/22/2023,"I would not use this 3rd party seller. They packaged an old version of the Xbox and sold it as a brand new version. I contacted their email addresses multiple times and not one response. I messaged Walmart and they tried to make it worth it, but they didn't. I deserve a full refund and the product since no one cares to communicate.",1
12/14/2023,Missed my order many times I changed address so I be there to pick it up I had to sign it with FedEx been out in the morning since 9 am to 5pm and when the guy had my package he slammed on the ground with the other packages the box was damaged,1
12/17/2023,"I bought a product that said ""NEW"" in the advertisement.
They left it at the gate of my house, in the rain, the box with broken seals, it got soaked, and the box looked like a used product. Walmart refused to refund my money.",1
12/3/2023,I ordered 2 Xbox X's at the same time so it had only one order number. I got one xbox and am still waiting for the 2nd one to come. I don't understand why the whole order didn't come together.,1

2/11/2024,"I saw this on other reviews and didn't think this would happen to me cause I live in a secluded area and I liked the monthly payment option so took the risk and regret doing so. I'm also pregnant and was hoping for an easy delivery option which I thought I was getting. 

I got a text today that my package was delivered and within 10 seconds I was outside looking for it cause it was a surprise gift for my spouse for Valentine's Day. Unfortunately, the package was nowhere to be found and the driver left a picture of a zoomed in shipping label. The picture was so zoomed in that I couldn't see anything else that would be helpful in identifying where it was placed or if it really left the truck. I also didn't see a truck stop by my house at all,...",1
2/10/2024,0/10 stars my order never arrived at my house and instead of a refund for the missing item they decided to tell me to file a police report against my driver who never arrived and i have no idea who my driver was and they told me to file a claim with my bank instead of just redelivering the item or giving me my money back despite the fact my order instructions were to directly hand me the item and they never did and marked it off as delivered,1
2/10/2024,This was an upgrade. It sucks that you have to buy a new one every few years just bc it won't let you play games that you pay for a membership to be able to play. It's really ridiculous when spend $500 and it's still functioning and 3 yrs later you need the new version. you should be able to play all. Makes no sense. Just a way for them to rob you. Thank goodness my son is almost grown and I'll never have to buy another one again.,1
2/11/2024,"If I could put 0 star, I would. The order was marked as delivered but ai never received it. I called right away and was told to wait a couple of days but still nothing. Walmart then informed me that they use a 3rd party vendor and can't process the reimbursement themselves. It was a birthday gift, now I have no gift and I'm still short my $450. Disgusting!!",1
2/2/2024,"This is a crap store! I bought the console for the holidays and sent it without opening the box literally a week later. So the store just cheated me out of my money!! He said that I didn't send anything to them)) Although, according to the tracking code, they received it with a slight delay from Fedex. This is how I solved this problem! The money was never returned!!",1
2/14/2022,"Warning! You are over paying for an Xbox.  I think the Xbox is fine, but the seller's site shows mulitple pictures of Xbox All Access which gives you 24 months of Xbox Live.  YOU WILL NOT GET IT, You are just overpaying for an Xbox.  I attached a screen shot of the picture before I bought.  I submitted complaint to Walmart.",1
11/16/2022,Fast shipping I received it today and I just opened it and it was most likely opened before and I expected brand new. Controller had small scratch the moment I opened it and there were dark smudges and dust all over the system itself HDMI cable has plastic wrapped on it nicely but the power cable had lose plastic on it. And the seals for the box itself were super hard to pull off so I had to slice them open instead.,1
1/21/2023,"This, Xbox is amazing my daughter loved it, but the way it was delivered is the reason why I’m complaining I told them they need to put it right in front of the door at least hide it with all these people stealing packages. It seems like Walmart did not care when they dropped it off first delivery service over $600 could’ve been stolen. You can see in the picture where exactly it was dropped off and this is all my daughter wanted for Christmas. I will never order from Walmart like this ever again.",1
6/24/2022,WORST DECISION I HAVE EVER MADE!!!Got this item for a Christmas preset for my boyfriend on Black Friday last year and it has been nothing but trouble. The console cuts off on its own and we have brought it to Walmart for a return or exchange and they wouldn’t take it because it was after the number of days they allow and we have brought it to repair shops in our area who say they can’t do anything and to try and return it. Worst decision I have ever made !!!DON’T DO THIS!!,1
12/27/2023,Everything was fine until its delivery today where the gentleman threw my package up the stairs instead of placing it respectfully. I don't I'll ever have anything delivered to myself again. I'll also not highly recommend anyone else get their items delivered that are my friends and family. I also have my ring camera video if you'd like to look into it further.,1
1/10/2024,I ordered on the Walmart app thinking I would save myself a little money.  The Xbox came from a 3rd party seller (Antonline).  It worked for less than 1 week and wouldn't turn on.  I returned it to my local Walmart in hopes of getting an exchange for one that worked being I ordered it on the Walmart app.  They would only refund my money and not exchange it because it came from a 3rd party seller.  Will take up to 2 weeks to get my money back so I can buy a new one.  Not happy!!!!  Would not order from antonline again.,1
12/30/2023,After I got my Xbox I set it up and started logging in and began to download the games from my previous Xbox one. Not even 30 minutes into the new Xbox being out the box and on it unexpectedly shut down. I tried turning it on only for the light to turn on for 1 second then turn back off. I left it alone for an hour only for the same thing to occur every time I tried to turning back in and I tried every solution on the internet. I got it for the price of 378 dollars including tax but it is not worth it if they are shipping out faulty and ruined consoles. Very shady and disrespectful towards us customers spending our money only for them to send us broken consoles and possibly used when they say it's “new”. Very disappointing.,1
12/27/2023,Echoing another reviewer - I intended to purchase this at the advertised price of $349 but did not realize that the price actually changes once you put it in your cart and order it. Beware of this! Customer service did nothing to help me in this situation since the gift was already given to another person. The only solution I was offered was to return it.,1
1/23/2024,"I never received my package! Honestly I planned on having it shipped the day I was supposed to be home and was lucky enough to have it shipped early WHEN NO ONE WAS HOME. I've spoke with Walmart and the actual seller and both say that since it says it was delivered there's nothing that can be done. Spoke to FedEx and they admitted they never got a signature for the box when it was delivered, complete shame to fail this bad at customer service.",1
12/27/2023,"Ordered online for a gift for Christmas at Walmart.com officially from the store at a discounted price of $349, they said they shipped it, they said they had a confirm picture but I never received it and they did not offer a refund or replacement. Not recommended if ordering online shop somewhere else where they have more of a guarantee so you're not wasting your money. I ordered a replacement from Best Buy paid slightly more but actually received the product it was delivered on time.",1
1/9/2024,"first of all the xbox the they pick for the instore pick up was damaged and there was a problem with locating the other 4 they had instock. but also the customer service at the in store pickup was horrendous, employees were just playing on phone and showing off, it took literally 20 min for them to acknowledge that i was trying to get there attention for help because not only was i there for my pick up but also need assistance locating an item in the store to because i was also shopping .",1
12/28/2023,"I ordered an Xbox, it was shipped in good condition. Problem is that it was just shipped as is. Bad enough it was a christmas present, it was an Xbox that was just left on the recipients doorstep. No discreet packaging or anything to hide what the item is. Just a big Xbox sitting on a doorstep screaming, “steal me”. 

Items of sensitive nature, especially expensive items need the added protection that might dissuade someone from taking it. Just shipping it as is seems silly.",1
1/6/2024,"I bought this Xbox Series X as a Christmas gift on December 21. We plugged it in on Christmas and realized the disc drive did not read any discs.

Walmart sold us a faulty console.

They would not exchange it or honor the price that I bought it for (was on a discount for Christmas).

So now I have a broken brand new console. 

I would recommend buying an Xbox from somewhere like Best Buy where they will have a better system to replace or fix the console for you.",1
1/24/2024,"Walmart never delivered my item. It has been still “In Transit” in Topeka, KS since Dec 20th. After numerous phone calls to FedEx and Walmart nothing has been resolved and nobody on the Walmart team even expressed a sliver of care. What a waste of time. Don't ever buy valuable products from Walmart unless you want them stolen in transit with little help after the fact.",1
1/5/2024,"If I could give this experience a zero star rating I would!!!! We ordered this Xbox on New Year's Eve morning for our children as a belated Christmas gift. It was supposed to sent from the Sheridan Drive store in Amherst, New York. Our boys anxiously waited at the door all day for it to be delivered .  Instead of receiving a new Xbox series X, they opened up a Walmart   bag to see two 12 packs of toilet paper.; address you kidding me!!!  I cannot fathom how such a horrendous error took place, whether a Walmart employee pulled a scam or someone else received our Xbox when they were supposed to get toilet paper and never had the decency to return it. I don't know, but I am an extremely unsatisfied customer!!! absolutely unacceptable!!!",1
12/27/2023,"Order from this Walmart when I live a half hour away only because they said it was in stock online. Purchased, drove all the way out here for them to cancel on me 10 minutes before pickup. They had over 8 hours to cancel my order. Walmart, not only will i never use your service again, I will make it my life's mission to make sure everyone I can speak too will never use this garbage service. I'd give zero stars if I could.",1

12/26/2023,I would give zero stars if I could. I bought this item online for  a gift only to receive notification that it wasn't in stock and the order would be cancelled AND I'd have to wait up to 10 days for a refund. Totally unacceptable and I'd never recommend anyone order online from Walmart.,1
12/11/2023,"I ordered the new Xbox series x online, when I placed my order on Thursday it told me I had 4 days to pick up my order. I received an email from Walmart yesterday reminding me that Monday December 11th, is the last day for me to pick up my order before they cancel it. As soon as I got off work around 4:00 p.m., I went to my Walmart app and hit the quotation I'm on my way "" button so they could have my order ready to be picked up. I received an email right away letting me know that my order was canceled because I did not pick it up on time?

11/27/2023,I have detailed instructions for this package. And the driver did not follow through with it. And he or she lied when the time it was delivered 2:44 freak no 3:14 pm. Its the holidays and thefts are up and funds are very tight....... I am very upset about this. Do better Walmart with FedEx delivery.,1
12/2/2023,"I normally do not write reviews but I waited 30 mins for my pick up and no one even came out to let me know what was going on. I didn't see not one member of the staff service anyone the entire time I was waiting, there was people waiting longer than I was. If they can't handle the capacity they need to limit how many people they serve a day.",1
12/20/2023,"I bought it, set it up, didnt work on tve. upon inspection I noticed the hdmi port on the console was already busted. Not sure if it was a factory defect or the quality of the console is just bad. So I had to return it. Day 1 and it was broken. bummer, so I grabbed a PS5 instead and am satisfied. I was looking forward to the xbox though especially with how powerful the console is and the deal that walmart had. I will most likely try to buy it again but am worried about seeing another broken hdmi port and others returned it for the same reason the day I returned mine so it wasn't just me :(",1
12/24/2023,"Item was marked “delivered” even though I never got it. No proof of delivery provided. Did everything Walmart asked, but after making me wait and call and wait, was told after a week that since THEY had it marked as delivered, my only option was to dispute the charge with my bank. I'll never trust Walmart again. A poor imitation of Amazon's services. Merry Christmas.",1
12/14/2023,Ordered 12/13/2023 for 12/14/2023 Waited all day for my delivery. I put in for a refund and it's 6:19pm EST AND STILL NOTHING!!!!! This was a tip off and someone is going to refund my money!!! Walmart will let anything go on. How are Walmart plus customers getting ripped off….?,1
12/8/2023,Order was delivered to the wrong apartment. Went to get customer support and no luck. I asked them to provide the previous delivery images of my apartment so i can dispute it with my bank so they can see the current delivery was not to my home and they just stopped replying and closed chat.,1

I checked with neighbors and nothing. I emailed company asking and they told me to contact police. I have emailed twice since and they won't respond. I am out money and no Xbox!",1
12/9/2023,I ordered this Xbox a week ago and just received an email the day of pickup saying my order was cancelled but my money had already been taken out of my account the day of purchase. You shouldn't have a product available for pickup if you don't have it in stock.,1
12/23/2023,They should know that you pay for your order drive an hour to pick it up then when you get there they cancel your order because they don't have it then tell u your bank will release your funds in 10 days.  I spend over 1000 a month at Walmart for groceries plus another 5 or 600 for other items.   I will never step foot in Walmart again,1
12/23/2023,i got the message saying my package had been delivered so i looked and there was nothing there. the picture of the house they sent me is not my house so i contacted them through chat and they told me to wait 2 days to see if it shows up. so my son will not get his xbox on christmas because the delivery guy cant do his job???? and the package was not inside another box. why would they not put a $500 gaming console inside another box before shipping it?,1
11/26/2023,Never received the item ordered. Had to spend hours on the phone getting a refund of my money.  I kept being told that it was delivered to my address.  I have a doorbell camera along with 3 other cameras that monitor the front of my house and street and after watching all movement for the 24 hours before and after after the stated delivery time I seen NO delivery truck nor anyone walk up or away from my house with a package.,1
12/15/2023,"I ordered two xbox consoles a week ago. Walmart cancels my order less than two hours before I'm to pick it up curbside. Terrible business and awful customer service.

11/22/2020,"My husband was super excited to get this on the preorder but when it was finally delivered, the disc wouldn’t take. Might’ve gotten damaged during delivery but it was a total bummer and we had to return it to the store. Microsoft wanted us to send it to them in exchange for a refurbished one which didn’t make sense on a system that was just released. Super disappointed though. Packaging it better could’ve made a difference because the bubble bags that came in it were deflated when we first opened it and from our doorbell camera we saw the delivery man drop it on the welcome mat. All in all, my husband loved the graphics and how fast the system ran but without being able to insert discs into the system it was a shame.",1
2/17/2021,"Wouldnt turn on after less than a month of use. Was playing games normally when all of the sudden the Xbox turned off and wouldn’t turn back on.

Everyone always said don’t buy on launch day but I was hopeful any issues I experienced would be easily resolved. However, I can’t get a dead console to work. No water damage. Wasn’t dropped. I literally went to bed and woke up and it’s dead. Its currently on its way to Microsoft for them to try and fix it. My advice? Just wait for them to work out their issues. It’s not worth it to get a faulty machine you spend over $500 only for the thing to crap out in less than 2 days. Totally disappointing.",1
8/7/2023,I bought the xbox series x online. When it got here i hooked it up and it turned on then 5 seconds later it turned off. I tried for a half an hour to get it to say on.

He has asked practically every day for the last 3 years ( Not an exaggeration,) It arrived on our doorstep in the actual xbox packaging 4 days before his birthday and was the very first person to see it arrive. That was very dissapointing. I would have loved very much to capture that moment on video to cherish forever. That xbox cost over $500 and i had to save up for years to be able to give that to him. It cost so much that he ended up not having any presents to open on his birthday and it was heartbreaking, because he watched his sister open a bunch of presents 2 weeks before that. The xbox came in the xbox box when it should have come in a gen...",1
7/10/2021,I wasted over 800 dollars and when it arrived it came in a box that did not say ‘fragile’ the box looked like it had seen some days. Unacceptable. Then I open the box and it was only the Xbox. No cords. No controller. How am I suppose to plug it in?? This is quite literally disappointing.,1
11/25/2020,"Mine would freeze and shut off randomly during use. The last time it shut down it said it needed a hard reset, which I did, and then it would ask for another hard reset over and over. So I took returned my unusable console. There tons of other people having the same problem. I would recommend waiting at least a few months before purchasing so that microsoft can fix their broken console.",1
7/18/2023,3 day shipping turned into the order being delayed and having no updates for 2 days. Most definitely the delivery services fault but sucked waiting for an expensive package that felt like it would never come. The box the package came looked like it was throw around and kicked. Not to mention that the tape holding the middle of the box together wasn't stuck to the box so at any point someone could have easily just opened it. The actual Xbox itself box seems okay but is a little squished in some corners. I haven't opened it yet and i probably won't because i'm scared that it's damaged or will stop working. For such an expensive item not a lot was done as far as protecting and securing it. I get shampoo bottles delivered that they take more pr...,1

5/17/2021,"Absolutely Terrible...order this April 15, said it would be delivered May 5, got delayed to May 13, and then I opened it AND IT WOULDNT TURN ON. Awful experience, never buying anything of value from Walmart again.",1
12/5/2020,Played for 1 hour and it kept shutting off mid game. Last time it happened the Xbox won’t even turn on. Unplugged it for 24 hours and tried to start it again and nothing. Definitely returning. Not worth $500.,1
6/21/2021,"Did not come with the power cord, hdmi, not the controller, spent so much on it. I wouldve atleast liked to have seen it come with what it needed to be set up",1
11/19/2020,This system has been nothing but issues. We had it for thirty minutes and wouldn’t turn back on. It ate one of my games and on top of it Microsoft has terrible customer service. Hopefully it’ll work in the future.,1
5/20/2023,"Have been owning this console for 2 weeks and it literally has connectivity issues daily. Mid game my controller %26 wifi disconnects and Im still unsure as to why it happens. Yes Ive hard reset it, factory wiped it, and all and it still repeatedly happens. I love how they made a great powerful machine in a small design compared to PS5(own both) but the I also see the issues long term XSX owners were talking about when it comes to Xbox",1
4/15/2023,"Does not work well, lags out and kicks you out of the game. No good if you play ranked games, you’ll end up being banned. So disappointing, my son thought it was our internet connection but we’ve found out it’s the Xbox, you have to reset it and it’ll work for about a weeks then start lagging out again. Do not recommend!!",1
1/1/2024,"When clicking the menu button, the screen goes black for ~2 seconds and then reappears. This is especially annoying mid-game. This is the second unit I have bought with this problem (first one was in MA, this one from TN). My Xbox Series S does not do this on the same monitor/hdmi cable, so this seems like a specific problem and I'm insure how there aren't mor mentions of it. Other than this, it worked as expected.",2
1/5/2024,I've only had it a couple of days now haven't done anything more with it than with the series S I got 7 years ago the download speeds are slightly better but I mean very slight it's far as once and restarted while playing chivalry 2 just wish I would have went with a PS5 instead,2
1/22/2024,"Unfortunately these systems simply aren't designed to last. Within three weeks of owning this system, it began having issues on startup. It requires me to unplug and reset the system and this needs to be done regularly. This is a common issue reported in Xbox systems and is not one I wish to deal with for such a new and expensive device.",2
12/23/2023,order was cancelled at first to start with. then i had to reorder after the money was put back hoping it was still on sale. Then when the purchase price showed 349 but checked out as 399 customer service promised once the item was received since it had already shipped that all i had to do was contact customer service and they would adjust and refund the difference. After speaking to 7 different agents and 3 hours on the phone they refused.,2
12/25/2023,Purchased online when I saw the deal and price dropped plus said arrives in 2 to 3 days. Irritated though because it said 2 to 3 day shipping. After I decided to buy it it said it would arrive in 12 days. I doubled checked everything before I made the purchase and that was messed up especially because I was only getting it cause it said arrives in 2 to 3 days.,2
4/15/2021,The boxes came damaged. Hopefully they system works fine.,2
1/6/2024,"This unit only lasted about an hour. The HDMI output failed. Despite having two Walmart stores in Decatur, I was required to drive to a FedEx in a different town to return it. (70 mile round trip).",2
7/14/2023,"Order on line, made sure it was from Walmart.
Came from Baton Rouge.  Looks clean and all accessories were still in bags or tied up.
Had a problem with the disk input a couple of times.
I guess time will tell.
Not real happy with this purchase. It does do movies. Have no games at this time to try.",2
12/4/2023,Purchased and charged for pickup at 11 then told it would be ready at 2:30 PM/ I was told wasn't in stock at pickup time. If it's not on stock don't offer it for store pickup guys.,2
12/22/2023,Sound is good they feel fragile but my biggest problem is the dongle and mic. I have to reset the connection to the dongle every time I turn on my Xbox. And randomly the mic will cut off and not work even though there is still sound in the headset,2
5/22/2023,"Absolutely loved it for it speed and storage, but i accidentally dropped it 1 foot from the ground and stopped working completely. I tried getting it fixed but a couple different tech stores, all have said it's unrepairable… you kinda figured if you buy a $500 console it could withstand drops like a PlayStation but no of course not that's too easy…",2
5/2/2023,Running a great graphics yet struggles to keep 120hz at 1080p with delayed graphics.  You are better of with a PC or a PS5,2
12/29/2023,When my son plays games they shut off because the console keeps overheating.,2
9/12/2023,I like the Xbox for sure but my one x was just as fast. Claims to be the fastest and smoothest running Xbox but still glitches in games.,2
7/16/2023,Only had this system about a month and the sync button doesn't work on the Xbox anymore.  Which means I cannot sync my new headset and controllers.,2
3/24/2023,Purchased two units for Christmas gifts and now one is not working. I contacted WalMart support to get a copy of receipt as should be a one year warranty and no help. Disappointed,2
11/10/2023,HDMI port broken with 3 months of having the Xbox X and only unplugging it twice since having it,2
12/7/2023,First online buy with a credit card hope I get the right product,2
4/3/2022,"misleading advertisement.   buyer beware. 

the Xbox is great. works perfectly thumbs up.     but if you look closely, the advertisement suggests it comes with the console, controller plus   ""24 months of game pass unlimited"".  well that's not the case when you purchase directly.      you have to go to a different website to use said promotion in the stipulations are getting on a payment plan of about $30 something monthly installments.     with the ultimate financial obligation being more than $800.            I guess silly me for not looking closer at the fine print. I assumed Microsoft was giving 24 months to new customers of the series X in this promotion.  in light of this   now I got my box but I'm bummed. 2 stars Walmart.  also the A...",2
1/28/2023,"This console worked for about 2 months and then crashed in the middle of a game. I couldn’t get it to start back up at all, after trying everything. And I mean everything. Mine could’ve been faulty but the internet has many people dealing with issues such as mine. Will be returning, it’s not Walmart’s fault tho. It’s Microsoft’s.",2
9/10/2023,Graphics underwhelming sound quality when using any headset not the best,2
6/3/2021,"Defective junk. We spent two days with tech support proving the wireless function was defective. Now shipping to tech non-support. Microsoft is overwhelmed with support that they are paying users to assist with tech support. 
Why ship a product that isn't ready and fully tested.",2
1/23/2022,"While my Xbox arrived VERY fast and in very good condition I am very disappointed because it didn’t come with the 24 months of ultimate, and for 700 dollars you’d think they’d make it known of the requirements needed to get the 24 months of Ultimate. I’m upset and I will be returning and getting the smaller version.",2
12/15/2021,"I have had my Series X since April and its fabtastic. That being said, do NOT buy this for these exorbitant prices. There is an app calle Hot Stock that will let you know when they are in stock for retail. Not easy to get but do not let the scalpers win.",2
1/17/2023,NEVER purchase any major electronics from Wal-Mart. Especially if you plan on purchasing a warranty with it.  They cannot refund you your warranty as it has to come from a 3rd party and it's supposed to be 8 days.  I'm on day 15 trying to get my money back,2
11/29/2021,"The console is great. The controller that came included with mine, however, came with a broken X button so it is essentially unusable. Walmart said this cannot be addressed on its own and the whole console would need to be returned to replace the controller, so buyer beware that you may or may not have to buy a functioning controller elsewhere.",2
8/8/2022,"I purchased this as a gift and they loved it. All you would expect from an xBox. Fast, smooth play, vivid picture etc. Now the bad. The thing is very hot when playing games. Extremely hot. So hot that 4 months after purchase, while not even using it, it began burning. Very disappointing in a kind of expensive purchase.",2
12/28/2021,"Sold and shippped by Walmart but when asked to leave a review for seller it shows Adel Shalabi.  BEWARE, Item is shipped using a company called Lasership who will take 5 weeks to get it from OH to MI.  They will not answer multiple emails asking status.  You start to wonder if it was even shipped, or is it being stolen because it is a ""hot"" item.  I did eventually get it and my son is very happy with the Xbox but I just can't understand why Walmart would use a shipping company that has a 1 star rating (can't leave a review without at least 1 star) which is really a 0 star review.  The Xbox X was fine and I""m happy with that but beware on the shipping.  I would have gladly paid extra to have had UPS or FEDEX deliver it within a few days.",2
5/29/2023,I bought this system and it started to glitch 3 days later after it was bought.,2
6/21/2023,Got the system worked good for a day then I couldn't download anything,2
1/12/2022,"I was expecting something more impactful. I honestly don't see a huge difference, although games load faster and doesn't to seem to have as much lag - this unit gets super hot FAST which is the opposite of what xbox preaches about this unit.",2
11/30/2021,"So disappointed that this was delivered, started once and then shut down. Over and over again. Called Microsoft and it needs to be sent back for repair. I would exchange it but with zero stock, that's not possible.",2
12/11/2023,"wheres the ""next gen"" games? many games are forward compatible with xbox one, never heard of that before. yeah, backwards compatible, but if games play on previius generation console, then theyre previous gen.  riddled with problems too, and a nearly non existent customer service from microsoft.  tgey want you to talk to other xbox players, who cant diagnose problems, and certainly cant issue any type of refund. this has been out for a coupke years now and nothing has really changed. i dont think ill buy another xbox ever again, and ive been an xbox owner since day one launch, 22 years ago.",2
11/15/2020,"ok, its not fair for regular people to buy a xbox for triple the price in eBay and other reselling web sites. I'm talking 1500 to 2500. And I think its unfair and Microsoft should do something about it like taking 60 percent of the money over 1000 dollar resells. To be honest, like other reviews bots are the problem. We just want to play and have fun during these hard times but no, these bots are just buying multiple xbox for resell. But im searching for one in the internet and im not willing to pay 750 dollars or more for a xbox from a stranger. Pretty un-organized Microsoft...",2
12/6/2020,"I have had the series x for a week now. I had just tuned on the console and began playing,  about 5 minutes in the console shut off and would not power back on.  After talking with Microsoft,  this is a known issue. Paying $537 to be a beta tester has left a bad taste in my mouth. I've owned every other Xbox and they have always gotten better at every step. Series x is no different the graphics and speed are great, the look of the console is meh. I feel they just rushed to market and their quality control is lacking. Good luck on your purchase I hope you don't have to wait 2 weeks to get yours back from Microsoft repair center like me.",2
3/23/2021,"This console sucks. I’ve had it since launch and have had nothing but problems. How are you going to tell me my old Xbox one runs better than this “4K” dump box. When it comes to regular games it’s fine, but if you go into a series x game, it’ll either crash after awhile or turn off the whole Xbox. The fast boot up times are definitely nice, but for $500? I should’ve just bought a pc, or at least waited a year after launch.",2
7/23/2021,"I have this console, as well as the PS5. As far as it goes, they both match up the same, but the controllers are extremely different. The PS5's controller is fantastic, but the one for the Xbox sucks and has broken in like a week. And I've been actively using the PS5 controller since release day, and it is perfectly fine. The only reason I give this two stars instead of one is because the console is still very good.",2
2/23/2023,It stopped working less than 45 days out of the box and it never got thrown around or anything it just sat on a desk.,2
11/22/2021,Works great but I paid for all access GamePass and it wasn't on the console and have tried to contact the seller with no response.,2
11/19/2023,this product is terrible. it doesnt play blu rays or dvds well. it frquently blacks out and doesnt go to 4k unless you turn things on in a certain order. shouldve bought a playstation.,2
11/22/2020,I cant even buy neither one because resales people take them all an jack up the prices they should let us people have a chance to get one it isn't fair. because I had both in my cart an then went check out they were gone,2
9/27/2023,"So, FYI, the Series X %26 all games are 30 FPS because that's what the Series S is, so don't bother. Also, the disc drives are bad. What's the point of buying the Series X?!?! Everything different about it is broken!",2

2/11/2021,Every 30 min ur sound will cut out and it wont come back till u restart the console and the console crashes way too much and when it does the controlled disconnects and the only way to connect it again is to take the batteries out and put them back in,2

11/19/2020,"I have migrated from Nintendo's Nintendo Switch for taking casual potable gaming, to a graphics powerhouse. Coming into buying the Series X, I honestly will say I wanted the Ps5, but my co-workers were Xbox players and I wanted to play with them. To my surprise, I couldn't find any games to play on the Xbox. Even with full backwards compatibility, all I could find myself playing is Halo 3, Final Fantasy, and Control. I was anticipating Halo, but the game does not have a release yet. I also had hope on Bethesda making a great Xbox exclusive, but there also not a release on a game from the either. Xbox is excellent for playing third party games. The graphical powerhouse shows its true colors in Final Fantasy, with its uncapped 120fps. I also ...",2

11/16/2020,It is so hard to get. I added it to cart and by the time I put my info in it was gone.  Also the alerts are like one min off.,2
11/26/2020,It took so long to get this console and im glad i could finally get this to anyone who hasn't keep trying atleast an hour after the drop you will have a better chance but screw you botmart,2
11/20/2020,I secured an xbox all access loanand they wouldnt accept it as payment today i was approved through another retailer and was told i could just enter account number to buy had it in my cart and wasnt given option to use it its frustrating hope they can secure consoles for someone who got approved had a hard inquiry 2 years to remove report and no console to be recieved?,2
4/12/2022,Walmart was fast shipping came early but Xbox series x is overrated its not optimized alot of just basic issues trying to run/download games/apps. It's mess up that game makers are only making new gameplay mechanics for new gen consoles and not pc forcing gamers to buy sub par systems,2
11/18/2020,"Since a lot people are posting random reviews (possibly even fake reviews), I'll get right to the point:
The pros:
-screaming fast console
-amazing graphics
-doubles as fridge (lol jk)
-very fast load times

the cons:
-basically more of the same - not much innovation
-same controller as the Xbox One
-no exclusive launch titles

Don't get me wrong, this thing is powerful and it does the job. However, it's basically just more of the same. For a new console that's supposed to last me an entire generation, I'm a bit disappointed with MS for basically just giving us a more powerful version of the Xbox One. Add to the fact that there aren't any interesting titles that are releasing with it, I'm a bit sad I spent my money on this console, especial...",2
4/7/2022,I loved my Xbox X series for the first two days I had it super fun fast great quality and then it decided it was over and conked out never to turn back on again no matter what trouble shooting I went through. Got o the point where Microsoft said it needed to be sent in for servicing so i decided to just get a replacement from Walmart as I figured it would be faster.,2
11/11/2020,I'd probably say  ita a four stars once I get one. I had one in my Kart and then went to check out and says out of stock. That's stupid. If you have an item in your kart then proceed to pay then it should be yours. Kinda upset but can't wait until I get one,2
11/16/2021,"I love the console. It is by far the quietest system I have owned since the nintendo 64, the graphics are great and quick resume is my new favorite feature. However, when I recieved my console from walmart the box had a huge dent in the corner and the console had a long scratch across the whole left side of the unit.",2
12/13/2021,"The product itself is fine.  The issue we had was with the shipping company, Lasership.  If you are looking to purchase an XBox Series X and it is being shipped by lasership, either plan to spend the next several weeks chasing your item down or cancel the shipment immediately!!  Lasership has extremely poor reviews through the BBB but this company was automatically selected to deliver to us.  First, we were given an expected arrival date of the 14th.  With this company’s reputation, my husband planned to take that day off from work so he could be home for the delivery.  We were concerned that “signature required” would be ignored and the item just left at our door and stolen OR they would attempt to deliver it and it would become “lost” bac...",2

1/25/2022,I love the new xbox x. The console got delivered  a day later than promised but I still got it. The only down side is walmart needs to start their own delivery service like Amazon. Fed ex is hurting their business.,2
11/13/2020,I started hitting refresh at 1045 central time and I did this until 1130 and it kept saying coming soon with other errors I was trying too get they all access xbox series x I stayed up all night cause I couldn't sleep I felt like crap the next day and all for nothing I like my sleep.if I could get too my local wall mart and order on a payment plan that be best I dont feel good too not sleep so at least I'd get my beauty sleep.....,2
11/14/2020,"So after the long wait i finally got my hands on the new Xbox X, to find out it overheats and shuts down after about 20 minutes into a game. From what I've read online the new games draws  so such power it trips a safety sensor on the new system shutting it down. This is ridiculous, after months of build up you would think they'd have these issues fixed. If you're gonna spend this kinda of money buy the PS5,everyone i know that was lucky enough to get one hasn't had any problems like this! $550 for Xbox series x i can't even play!",2
11/15/2020,"Got this from Amazon. What the console can do is good, but the series consoles don’t feel next gen. It just feels like a faster Xbox one. Same ui, same controller bar the share button, no launch exclusives, and it might go down as the ugliest console of all time. The ps5 isn’t the best looking console either, but it’s defining and innovative. You will always know it when you see one. Where the series x is just a basic rectangular box. Since every game will either be on all Xbox consoles and pc there really is no reason to recommend this console if you have an Xbox one or pc.",2
8/26/2021,The console is really good. The pricing is way too ridiculous. Not worth it.,2
11/26/2020,can't even order one from all the freaking bots and scalpers,2
12/26/2021,How do I get the 24 months of the ultimate game pass that was with the purchase of the Xbox series x? There was not a code included,2
11/26/2021,It’s a bit pricey. Which is the reason for the stars. Other than that it’s exactly what Xbox advertised. Very happy with this console.,2

FedEx just delivered this 20 minutes ago and when I opened it up, I did find Minor damage to the corner of the packaging right out of the shipping box.  I’d add the Corners of the box are fairly solid, so it’s not easy to say how hard it had to be hit right at that edge to bend them in.  But If the inside is packed secure the console should be perfectly fine.

I had to reset the box once already by unplugging, and letting it set as it crashed and would not come back up, lost the voice. when it works right you could not ask for a better game machine, this is after having a PlayStation. If you play from the cloud, get ready to be told that you have to wait as there are a lot of people playing. I have been told my wait time was up to one hour, so I went with the disk, and using the game pass you couple save the money to buy the box in a couple of years.

Which I've had for a long time and it's a great console. Only a handful of games are even new, and current gen only on it. Maybe about 20 or less, and most aren't very good. That doesn't warrant a ($500) purchase imo. It does run quiet and cool, but it's just not a substantial upgrade from the One X imo. Also I have a PS5 because of it's exclusives (which Xbox doesn't have) and the future doesn't look very promising either. That's all I need, so I took this back.

Form factor - smaller and fits in more spaces than PS5. Curious about heat dissipation as everything is crammed closer together inside than in the PS5.

Noise - quieter than PS5 when running, even under load.

Backwards compatability - so far runs every 360 and One game thrown at it. Dissapointed with lack in OG library. Was really hoping this would replace all my old hardware.

Storage expansion - for high speed ssd need to use proprietary expansion while PS5 can be expanded with any Nvme .2m ssd. External expansion is more open.

However, 2 weeks later I notice while shopping that the Xbox series X is now $100 cheaper than the supposed Black Friday deal online. $100, that's substantial with the current price of everything today.
I went to customer service to see about a price match guarantee, however I was just told that I missed the sale, sorry! So the point is, don't let the supposed Black Friday or special deals trick you as they did me. I purchased the system then instead of waiting because of the store and online hype about the Black Friday savings. It was $50 off the online price but 2 weeks later, it ...",3
12/10/2023,"it was my first time ordering an item online from you. i had to ask another customer where i had to park to get my item. pharmacy and pickup makes me think it's for pharmacy only, not online order pickup. more specifity wont hurt. besides that im happy with purchase",3
12/15/2023,Well the boxed was really damaged in the corner of the box. I am scared that something might be wrong with system. We wrapped it already and put under the tree so we will have to wait until Christmas to make sure the system is ok.,3
12/24/2023,"The controller uses batteries, game pass is not that good. PlayStation has all the games that this has other than halo but that game has gone downhill. It can't even play all the old Xbox games unless it's in the store for sale.",3
11/10/2020,"Walmart needs to add the I am not a robot feature, because its so easy for scalpers to set up auto buy with bots. I been waiting this whole time and to have a bot auto purchase so they can sell it for $1000",3
7/18/2021,Xbox X product advertised on Walmart.com with 12 months Ultimate Game Pass included.  This made the higher than normal price justifiable. Unfortunately.  Ultimate Game Pass in Xbox X were expired and not valid,3
7/15/2023,"Delivery was good, It arrived on time and no damage. However, I couldnt figure out why it overheated quickly after only 30 mins of playing so I ended up returning it.",3
2/13/2024,it a good gaming systems.,3
5/20/2021,"I definitely had my concerns purchasing this very OVERPRICED hard to find item.  I was concerned with it being sold through a 3rd party (Nationwide Distributors).  It came yesterday and I was very pleased to see it was in new condition and packaged well.  Other than it being extremely overpriced, the only complaint I have is that it doesn't include the ""All Access Package"" deal that you get through other companies charging this price.  My son is happy that we finally were able to get it since it was technically his promised last years Christmas gift.",3
12/10/2020,"I find it ridiculous in 2013 we can have a terabyte of space on the Xbox and that 7 years later they still haven’t changed how much space you have!!!! I understand it’s a brand new custom SSD but the fact you’re paying 500$ to put a max of 18 triple A games on the console is absurd. And that’s just personally, some people have Modern Warfare or Cold War which is nearly taking up an entire eighth of your storage! Games are only getting bigger and bigger and they seem to see no problem with having zero space on your console. Then they want to charge you 200$ for an extra 1 terabyte. You’re telling me the ssd alone In the console costs more than a third of the entire console?!?! It’s simply absurd to charge nearly the cost of the series S for ...",3
12/2/2020,It was quick service the only problem I have is the box the console comes in was damaged,3
1/23/2024,I just wanted to send it back,3
1/5/2024,It was ok for the price but it could of came with a game or game pass,3
1/24/2024,too many incompatible 360 games. had to return it,3

4/26/2023,"Shipping took way longer than it said. It took 5 days, when it said it'd be delivered the next day at checkout. But I'm very pleased with the Xbox. Works great!!! Just wish they wouldn't have lied about the shipping times.",3
4/15/2023,"I bought it November, the Xbox is great. But my controller doesn’t work anymore and it’s been taken care of . It says that I’m always clicking the Right stick.",3
9/12/2023,My xbox came with no power cord only the hdmi the unit and the controller!,3

8/24/2023,I dislike how it was 50 dollars more in person than it was online,3

7/19/2023,The remote control breaks very easily,3
12/15/2023,Good but $$$,3
12/19/2021,"The Series X plays XBOne, XB360, and even XB Classic games with little to no trouble. It's an efficient piece of machinery that isn't easily overwhelmed and its vertical position makes it fairly easy to display with other consoles. It arrived in seemingly mint-condition and in a timely manner, but with taxes, it cost almost nine hundred dollars. I believe six to seven hundred dollars would be a fair price for this console.",3
12/14/2022,The box came damaged on two corners so I had to open it and check to make sure the actual Xbox was okay. It was luckily but I don’t know why carriers cant be more carful with packages. It was in another box and both boxes inside and out were damaged so it must’ve been dropped pretty hard… hopefully when we use it after Christmas it will work fine,3
12/13/2022,"The ordering process and delivery were very good. No complaints at all. The Xbox One Series X was, however, a disappointment. It has no HDMI input ports and Microsoft removed the OneGuide app used for over-the-air TV viewing. Makes the new device less useful. Now I have to keep my old Xbox to watch OTA TV. Not a better experience!",3
11/26/2021,Love the fact i was able to be one of the lucky ones on black friday to get this item but you would think a hugh dollar item high vakue item such as this would need a signature upon delivery .. it is that time of year where porch thiefs like to take packages .. good thing i wasnt dar away when it got delivered ..,3
9/7/2021,"When I finally received it 4 days late, it looked like it was punted down a long flight of stairs. The outer and inner boxes were dented up pretty good, the XBox packaging is pretty banged up and the corners are dented in, but luckily the console was padded with styrofoam inside its box and it seems to be working fine so far. I'm excited to get set up, but I'm concerned the system might have been damaged on impact(s).",3
1/23/2022,I joined Walmart  for this and was able to get one on first attempt. So far it's been pretty good but I'm disappointed that the menu system and the controller are mostly unchanged from last gen. Games are good but was expecting more. At least they can update the UI in the future.,3
4/28/2021,"Graphics and load speeds are outstanding; however, there is visual noise all over the screen when playing.  Microsoft determined the unit is defective and the only options are send for repair (could take 2  months) or return to store.  Unfortunately there's no way to exchange since these are so hard to come by.  Bummer to wait so long to finally score one of these and then have to send it back.",3
2/3/2021,"I give it 3 stars because it took me forever to finally get one and we didnt even have it for 10 hours before it stopped turnining back on. Nothing we tried worked. Nothing Microsoft had us try worked. The time it did work, the graphics were great! But overall its a waste of money. Do not recommend until all the bugs are worked out!",3
6/2/2021,"Fantastic graphics and speed. Hardly any delays when loading and starting.  Exactly what we hoped for when purchasing it.  A great upgrade from an Xbox One S.  The only issue was transferring games and files from the old system - took longer than expected.  
3 stars - only due to the fact that my son had to overpay to get it.  I don't like that resellers can charge so much on the Walmart website.",3
12/16/2022,"Having owned this a few months now, I can honestly say the games look amazing, load times are quick, and all the advanced tech features are excellent. The 4k gaming is great for sure! There's a solid variety of games, and the console runs pretty quiet. So far it's been very reliable. I love this console and will enjoy it for years! 

As much as I love this console, I'm extremely disappointed in the backwards compatibility feature. The console doesn't read disks like I expected. Unfortunately, there's no such thing as the Xbox simply reading the disc and playing it any more. I still have to download every single game when the disk is put in for the first time, and if the game isn't available in the online store, forget about it.  It won't ev...",3
3/13/2023,Wireless network doesn't connect.,3
7/15/2021,Never i thought i would buy something so expensive other than a car it is way too overpriced but other thatn that is a little better console that the xbox one x let see in the future how the cooling sistem work,3
11/3/2021,the controller was clearly used as the A button is super sticky and unusable. sucks i spent so much for the system and had to immediately buy a new controller as well,3
12/2/2020,"When I try playing cold war the game freezes and then the console turns off, I know it’s a problem with cold war but come on 500$ and I can’t play my favorite game.",3
6/15/2022,Was able to actually purchase an Xbox after months of trying but I did pay way over retail unfortunately. Pretty quick shipping and signature required which was nice that they didn't leave it on my front door,3
12/23/2020,Felt like a much faster Xbox One.  I wish they changed the UI a bit but no. I liked how fast and efficient backwards compatibility was though. I ended up selling it for a PS5,3
12/15/2021,The system is great and arrived on time but the controller that came with the system is broke.  For paying double of the market price you would think that everything would be working properly.,3
12/2/2020,"the main issue I have with the system is that it's inconsistent, causes random shutdowns, and can be tough on a TV that's not necessarily as powerful as the system requires.",3
4/14/2021,"better console overall faster frame rate and loading. Better graphics and rendering. BUT it took a month to get to my house and controller came with a broken audio jack, and honestly the time and effort plus the money isn’t worth it for the console.",3
12/23/2023,I've already had issues everything older is better honestly if you have an Xbox One X don't upgrade I've had software issues not wanting to delete stuff it's just junky maybe with a few software updates it'll be fine I don't know honestly get yourself a gaming laptop or something,3
11/19/2020,"Had an amazing experience all the way up until the thing died overnight, completely bricked, I had to send it to Microsoft to fix it. 

I hope this is a low percentage of people having this happen, but it just sucks having it happen to you, hopefully I get some sort of compensation for the month of game pass ultimate and a lack of a console while its fixed. Garbage launch from both Xbox and PlayStation.",3
11/26/2020,"There are very few next gen games at launch and the one I decided to purchase doesn't work properly on the Series X (Watch Dogs Legion; patch reportedly inbound December 2020 to fix COMPLETE INABILITY TO SAVE THANKS UBISOFT). This thing is smooth, but won't surprise you a whole lot if you had the Xbox One X. Pretty mediocre launch, but I am apparently VERY fortunate to have gotten my hands on this thing as retailers are struggling to fight bots and everyone is frustrated with Wal Mart. I'm looking forward to the real titles that showcase this console, but likely not coming anytime soon. Also, quick resume isn't even a thing right now.

11/29/2020,I bought the X Series and really like the looks. So far I have had no issues with game play. Is it worth the $500??? Not really. The graphics are better but I just do not SEE the reason for a whole new system. I will say I do like the shape of the console as it save space for me.,3
12/10/2020,"So I have recived the ""Brand new"" XBOX X SERIES, it was only 15 days after the order was placed and paid for in full, the real kicker startet when I opened the package delivered by FedEx, You could clearly see that original box was opened, all 4 edge seals has been resealed and after inspecting the components it looked like controller was removed and at this point not sure if the one inside is original or not, some documantation is missing and it was not put back togheter as original package. 
It was on the truck out for delivery on Tuesday early morning, then it was recorded back in the same facility Wednesday around 2am and finaly arrived Wensday midday. Not sure if its worth all the hadache",3
11/18/2020,"Picked it up, set it up the next day and I already need to send it back. The system has an issue with the disc drive not reading ANY discs. Ugh. How does a $500 system get passed QA testing and shipped with such a basic defect?!?! Aside from that....IT IS AWESOME. The graphics are insane.",3
1/21/2022,"Works well, but grossly overpriced.  I didn’t have to pay the inflated price, obviously,  had I chosen to wait several months.",3
11/21/2020,Was pretty excited to actually be able to buy one and make it through check out. Disappointed to find out when I clicked pick up in store it still is being shipped and will take 2 weeks.,3
11/24/2020,It’s ok it’s cool it’s new but save your money till next year lots of lag and other things basically an Xbox x no point of upgrading now when there’s no exclusive games on it and the graphics aren’t much better,3
6/13/2023,"I'm not impressed, after 5 months I'm giving my review. My biggest disappointment is the controllers both have issues. The first issue started early on with the trigger pads losing the cushioning on both controllers. My major disappointment is the lack of quality games. I'm stuck playing 10 year old titles like gta 5 only because there really isn't any good games and game pass games are more like mobile games . Or just the lack of any quality games same as games not on game pass . Subscription to game pass is required to play online mode which is a rip off . Other consoles and pc are not supported to play with on almost every game .",3
3/25/2022,Mine did not come with xbox all access.,3
8/31/2021,Now to wait for programs to catch up.  Can't load mods for what ever reason.,3
2/13/2023,Smelled like burnt plastic for like two months in my house. had me  kind of paranoid,3

6/17/2021,Finally got a series x and it broke within 3 weeks.  Was able to return but now back on the search,3
11/19/2020,Can believe it sold it and I was in the payment screen.,3
2/5/2022,Limit on memory and expensive expansion,3

Honestly Id recommend the oculus quest 2 way more fun.",3

11/13/2020,"People, stop writing reviews for issues with ordering when these reviews are for the product. I don't want to read your whining about not getting an xbox on launch day. Grow up. Realize that more people than just you couldn't get an xbox on day one.  IT IS A VIDEO GAME CONSOLE.  Calm down and use this review section to review the product not whine about not getting something on the day you wanted it.",3
11/26/2020,"If you get a system that doesn't work you don't send it to Microsoft to fix or get a refurbished one in its place, you return it and get your money refunded. Why would you try and get it fixed and not just wait, since you realize the first one was a mess up. Also make them give you something extra for the mess up.",3
11/26/2020,"I'm fine with the system, the only reason I am writing this review is to point out the gratuitous number of scalpers that use your sight simply to purchase the brand new console, then turn around and sell them for another 300 added to the almost 600 dollar price tag. Please fix your marketing team and sales teams issues before these consoles end up harder to get than a bar of gold.",3
1/27/2021,"Console freezes a lot, every time you start up you have to reconnect any device connected",3

11/26/2020,Like ur website actually sucks. When I try to add to cart it takes me oopppps deer with dig in antlers and doesn't let me add its stupid like if ur going to do that then don't say anything I waited all day to buy and when it  Release I could even buy it,3
4/18/2022,"I was expecting more from the Xbox Series X, but as it turns out it functions exactly like my Xbox One except with faster load times, not worth the 499 i spent. On the plus side my xbox one controllers work with it. If your looking for the exact same Xbox One experience with a little bit faster load times this is for you.",3
11/26/2020,"It seems like a pretty beefy and good console, but the way that someone can go about purchasing one is terrible. Scalpers will just setup some bots to buy out all of them upon each restock, and if you don't use bots, you need to have crazy luck or a friend in Walmart or Microsoft. SMH",3
4/7/2022,"I’m happy to finally get back into the XBox eco-system after not having a Microsoft system since the XBox 360 era.  I’m very satisfied with the Game Pass subscription offer, which offers more games than I can imagine on having the system for the first few days.  I’m also pleased that all the games I had purchased on my Microsoft XBox marketplace from my 360 are mostly there with backwards compatibility (still waiting on Microsoft to make my original X-Men arcade game, MVC 2, and Soul Calibur to be available for download).

My biggest gripe about this system is that there’s no firmware to use my old arcade stick on this system.  I even went out of my way on purchasing a Brook USB converter, only to have it dried out two days later.

Overall,...",3
4/18/2022,"The product itself was great. But the service was terrible, first they were late with the delivery. Then the put a restriction on the delivery, I called Walmart to change the delivery to FedEx location because I was going to be out of town on the CHANGED delivery date. Walmart refuse to budge, fast forward to the date of delivery. FedEx dropped off the product at my door without the REQUIRED SIGNATURE. I call Walmart to let them know I was not home to sign for the product and I'm not sure if it there. They responded by saying FedEx said it was sign for and I should discuss this with my bank. Luckily my neighbor was nice enough to pick it up and hold it for us until we got home. The FedEx delivery driver blatantly told my husband and myself ...",3
4/11/2022,"Great console, but unfortunately I was sent a defective one and had to send it back shortly after receiving it. I enjoyed the graphical updates and faster loading times for a few days though. Same interface as the previous Xbox and had no trouble getting all my old stuff installed quickly.",3
11/10/2020,"Console is good but Walmart doesn’t understand how to market. I signed up for stock alerts via email so I could not only be on the app constantly refreshing, but it would alert me so I know it’s available. Electronics sales rep told me to check at 11am today and it should be in stock. I’ve been on since 9 am refreshing and the minute I saw add to cart I did. Wasn’t even 30 seconds and i was already paying for it so there is no possible way it could’ve went out of stock that fast. Says console is out of stock and it wasn’t even 11:01 yet. Didn’t get an email or anything. Walmart fix your marketing team.",3
11/29/2020,"Same as the Xbox One X but worse. The games keep freezing and the console randomly shuts off frequently. If I position the console upright, it makes a very weird noise from the fan. Do not waste your money on this first round of consoles...let Microsoft fix the bugs first.",3
4/6/2022,"The product itself works as I’d expect it to, and I’m glad I didn’t pay double its price like most have been since it came out. However getting the Xbox delivered was extremely irritating. I ordered it March 23rd and it was supposed to arrive on March 38th. For some reason it didn’t and I had problems tracking it and seeing why it wasn’t getting out. I also got no notifications from Walmart or FedEx saying it was delayed. Finally it got delivered on Thursday March 31st, but again, no notification that it was out for delivery. Just the notification that it was delivered. So while I’m satisfied with the product, I’m not at all satisfied with how I got it.",3
4/23/2022,"Love the speediness, Picture quality, and over all the artistical appearance  and practical performance of the beautiful xbox series x has exceeded my expectations. Very blessed to have received this at $500 unfortunately a couple years too late thats why this deserves a 3 star because it was shorted for a very long time,",3
4/1/2022,"I paid in full for the Xbox Series X and suppose to comes with Xbox All Access. No it does not comes with the All Access pass unless you sign up with a $34.99 monthly plan.

Other than that, the Xbox Series X itself is really nice. The quality is superb! The accessibility feature in the Xbox is very good! The controller is nice as well, but should be better with rechargeable one as PlayStation controller always came with rechargeable battery. I have nothing else to say but nice thing about the console. I recommended this console.

I decided to keep it even though it does not come with Xbox All Access pass.",3
4/1/2022,"The console is fine works great and is awesome, however the 24 month subscription of gamepass did NOT come with the console and after contacting Walmart they suggest I speak with Microsoft, who then said I should contact the loaner, who then told me to get into contact with Walmart. Then it was pretty much repeat. So I paid an extra 300 for pretty much nothing. I may be the small percentage that had this problem but I’d still recommend waiting if I were you, just incase.",3
3/11/2021,Bad product,3
7/22/2021,I really want to get one but the price is just dumb I know it's a new console but really?,3
5/27/2021,Why are you selling a $499 system for over $900?,3
11/20/2020,Please do something to help the keep the bots from buying everything.,3
11/30/2021,"The shipping was faster than expected, the Xbox is great, but it’s sad that I had to pay double just to get a console. I know that it wasn’t ideal, and the demand was really high, but what can we do?",3
4/9/2022,I wanna give it 5 stars so bad but when its standing up straight it makes the most god-awful grinding noise whenever you put discs in the disc drive and when you dont the system “farts” when you power it on..,3
11/29/2020,"I don't have one,  but i noticed the reviews ive seen, Microsoft won't respond to the people who are having problems with their machines..hmmmm
Makes me think twice about buying one.",3

11/25/2022,broken box.  i ordered this from pickup and the box was badly damaged l. heres hoping the packaging held up otherwise i will be using my warrenty early,3
11/26/2020,"Thanks for nothing Wal-Mart. ""Available 11/25 at 9 PM"" - yet somehow gone in less than 10 seconds. How about you do something about the scalpers and bots?",3
11/26/2020,Walmart is trash. Gotta get your system right.  Done had this in my cart twice and it wouldn't go through.  Trash trash trash. Yall pay your workers overseas pennies so you think you could afford a good server.,3
3/20/2022,"Didn't really meet expectations.  Forza at 120Hz is not much different than at 60Hz at 4k. If you have a One X, don't pay scalper pricing for the Series X. Just wait for the next Walmart restock thru W .",3
3/30/2022,"Performance is great but not that much of a difference from my One X. I'm also not a fan of how massive this console is, so hopefully they'll release a slim version this year",3
1/12/2024,Be careful with the Ethernet port.. you will not see a lot of reviews for it. Just be careful. If the Cord gets stuck in the port. Find a tiny flat head and wiggle it out. So it doesnt mess up.,4
4/29/2021,"Somehow I snagged one during a drop. Shipping was pretty fast, overall I am very happy with the series x.  But to be honest there is really nothing out at the moment that makes it worth your time to be glued to stock alerts and Twitter to try to get one.  Yes its nice and games look great, but it might be worth your time to just wait.  Im playing the same games on it that I was on my one x, and while they look great it really isnt jaw dropping yet, since there is not many next gen only games yet. So my advice is wait, or if you dont mind being glued to your phone for weeks in end and trying to get one, go for it.  Just dont expect any jaw dropping visually miraculous games for a while",4
2/9/2024,Fast on time shipping %26 came in great condition.,4
2/1/2021,I luckily landed a purchase on one of these after many failed attempts due to bots. I have now had a full month with the system and I am overall pleased with it so far. The main reason I wanted the new console was to be able to play DayZ without the constant stuttering and frame drops. With The Series X  it feels like Im playing the game on PC again! The game runs significantly better. The so console also runs other games I enjoy like Wreckfest and Pubg very well. I love the new dynamic Home Screen background option as well. My only complaint is the on/off button is cheaper than the previous consoles. You notice right away.,4
7/27/2021,"I loved my Xbox One so in turn I love the Series X.

Likes: 
1.) Games load really fast.
2.) Games look and sound great. New 4k games look great and older games have been smoothed out. No more jaggies or artifacting.
3.) Xbox Series X and Game Pass is awesome. I can own must have titles on disk and download play lots of other titles that I normally wouldn't buy on game pass and sometimes be pleasantly surprised.

Dislikes:
1.) No media center support anymore. They took away the ability to watch Live TV thru a TV tuner or cable box input. My Xbox One was the center of my media hub for games, movies and TV but they took all that away with Series X. Games and streaming media only now.
2.) The form factor of the box is fine but it's now too big...",4
4/30/2023,"I thought the series x will be really much better Than the Xbox series s, but to be honest, Xbox series s worth it every Dollar comparing to the Xbox series x.",4
12/6/2020,"The low reviewers are just fan boys for PlayStation. Me I dont hate PlayStation in the end we all are united thru cross play thru games like call of duty to Fortnite and so on. 
Another reviewer said their Xbox is defective yeah but you do know that can contact Microsoft and receive a new one or take it back to the store for a refund. 

Me the console is Great nice and quite. I prefer my games digital. But when you insert a disk you can hear noise aint that bad or annoying but yeah. So digital gaming is good/great",4
12/6/2020,"Great console! I have it for a few weeks now and it is a huge upgrade from the xbox one x. Super fast load times, better graphics and solid 60pfs make for a much better experience. The only downside is that there isn't a lot of content to show off what it can do at the moment. I would give it 5 out of 5 but I have run into a few annoying bugs that I hope will eventually get resolved (no audio and have to do a hard reset to fix and hdmi not properly turning off at times after returning to the dashboard).",4
7/8/2021,My son really wanted for his birthday . It came in a box and it was not damaged. Overall.. were very satisfied.  Even tho it was pricey but worth it. Thanks,4
12/1/2020,Xbox console is great but the controller looks n feel cheap..my old Xbox one controller is much better....I could be better for a next generation game console,4
2/14/2024,Bought this behemoth to replace my series s and it definitely is good I can't complain about it. Controller only lasted a couple months but all controllers get sticky buttons. If you travel and want a gaming device to bring with you I'd recommend the series s or Nintendo Switch,4
12/1/2020,"I thought the process was extremely difficult, however, it was worth the try. So far owning the console it has been a lot of data transferring. But the few gameplay I have done has looked incredibly better than my xbox one s. I cannot believe I’m saying this, but it was definitely worth the anger and time waiting for it.",4
11/16/2020,"I bought this Xbox with a confirmed order (only for it to be canceled a day later) however Walmart was nice enough to give me my console under my name , I tried it as soon as I got home and I can easily say it works really good (it has randomly shut off twice ) but ever since then it works really well and has nice graphics would recommend 8.5/10 to someone",4
12/13/2020,"Great console with incredible speed. Load times are virtually eliminated, even with graphically demanding games. Variable refresh rate keeps a consistent 60fps no matter what goes on on-screen. Coming from the original Xbox One it seems like an Xbox One 2.0. However, support for games that are Series X/S enhanced is scarce. No new games at launch. Also Xbox could have updated the Home Screen to feel more next-gen. Overall I would recommend this console to Xbox fans but I would wait until they become more readily available in 6 mo. - 1 yr.",4
4/2/2021,"Item came a day late but besides that, Happy to have acquired one. Arrived safely",4
12/29/2023,"i like my PS5 better, but alas i own one

the walmart experience of buying and pickup without having to wait in understaffed queue lines was perfect. Wal Mart needs to stop being so cheap and pay people a dcent wage or give 10%off for those who use self checkout",4
1/14/2024,Xbox One Series X. New. I saved about 110.00 dollars. Wow. Powerful machine. The controller and cables were not included with the delivery. Shipping separately. Have not received them yet. Been too way long. I used my older controller and cables for this new system. Incredible graphics. Worth the $.,4
12/18/2023,"Been using the ps5 for a few years. Saw a sale for the series x so I got it. I am surprised at how well the system runs. It is quiet, powerful , and runs very smoothly. I recommend this system as a next gen console, if you do not want the playstation exclusive titles. Halo infinite is very fun.",4
12/23/2023,"Fast download times, great graphics. I opted to add a 2 TB Seagate SSD and I thought it was way overpriced but it was the only one that was fully compatible and with no loss of speed or file transfers before playing. Overall it is definitely a great upgrade.",4
12/19/2023,"I would've given a 5 star but package was not delivered where specified. very happy I got an xbox series x for so cheap I couldn't believe it honeslty, I thought I got scammed after I paid. The product was delivered a day early which is awesome. But I selected the package to be delivered to the back door and also manually entered in Please place package by backdoor/garage, when it was delivered it was placed on the front door step.",4
12/9/2023,"Hello everyone I just received the Xbox series X by Fed X ground yesterday evening.  I ordered it Dec 7 th so it came pretty fast I opened the Walmart box it came in just to make sure everything was in there. The only problem I have was whom ever packaged it  should have secured it better inside the box it had brown paper under it   And a few folded on the side.  it was sliding when I lifted the box up . Plus I've seen the way Fed x and UPS guyz thrown the boxes around in the trucks so I hope when my son opens it on Christmas that it's not damaged . So far the box the console is in  looks good ,   just praying 🙏🏾 it works good when he hooks it up thanks for having it on sale",4
12/27/2023,Sat in the car for hours waiting just to be told they messed up putting me in the computer and made my family wait in the heat even longer but the packed was not damaged so thats good.,4
12/29/2023,I tried to get the match price online from Walmart. The price on targets online was only 349.99. I paid 424.99 online. I could not get anyone on the phone to get a price match.,4
1/6/2024,"Works as expected with one exception… says it's backward compatible with all previous versions' discs; however, I could not get it to work with a 360 disc",4
1/8/2024,"I would be more thrilled with this purchase if the box didn't show up looking like someone threw it down a flight of stairs… five times. 

The console seems to be running fine. But I can't help but wonder if it's going to give me problems later on.",4
9/14/2023,"Runs very well, has a lot more storage than i was initially expecting, definitely has better graphics on games i normally play. The only down sides is i wish it came with a USB cord, like my sister got when he purchased his xbox x from a different store and the fact that with a Playstation when you get the PSplus subscription you get to keep your downloaded free included games that normally cost money even after you cancel the subscription when you dont have the money it or just dont want it anymore, while with the Xbox game pass you aren't allowed to play the games you download and put money into while playing it after you cancel it, like whats the point of paying monthly to play it for ""free"" when u could just save up and buy the game to ...",4
2/5/2024,"No software or GamePass Ultimate subscription included.
At least these are less than two years from the factory",4
12/11/2023,Would have been 5 but had to call after check in because employee did not tell them that someone has parked in wrong spot. So waited for 20 minutes becuase she forgot.,4
12/14/2023,i love the system. I've had it 6 months maybe ..it crashed and i had to send it microsoft..they fixed it very fast but still . I was disappointed..but game wise its great.,4
12/26/2023,"When I got this package, it was packed well, protected. When I open the box everything was there, I played the games, I love it! I would recommend anyone to get this console, it's well worth the price…",4
12/26/2023,"like the products with speedy turn on and resume 
dislike that the usb adapter for this xbox X doesn't work, and the controller is AA size battery which is consumed in 5 hrs games",4
12/24/2023,so my child absolutely loves her xbox x series newest version Xbox but the only complaint is that for amount of money you pay you only receive 1 controller.  just crazy to pay all that money %26 only get 1 controller!,4
1/7/2024,Great price. Easy delivery. Was not clear about third party sales but everything worked out. Third party could have better communication.,4
1/15/2024,Controller runs on AA disposable batteries. Needed to get aftermarket rechargable battery pack with charger.,4
12/22/2021,It arrived on time,4
12/9/2023,"Mostly the same as my Xbox One X , but just a tad bit faster. Got it on sale as well so that is an added bonus.",4
12/14/2023,"The product was in great shape and I got it for a good sale price as well. 
The box was a bit damaged but no physical damage to the product.",4
12/19/2023,I love it so far ! But it did come with someone PayPal account already hooked up which was kind of weird 🥴 but other than that it's 🔥🔥,4
12/31/2023,Controllers are finnicky. Still very expensive. Console works great.,4
1/2/2024,Very happy with the price and delivery time!,4
12/27/2023,My son love his x box he love play Roblox and race game,4
1/20/2024,This was a birthday present. The recipient loved it!!,4
1/17/2024,"Very fast, great graphics driver! Miss DVD/CD.",4
10/1/2023,"It is what you'd expect, but the controller tends to not connect when I use it to turn on the console.",4
8/20/2023,works great but definitely invest in dust covers or cooling fans for it if you play on a serious level,4
5/26/2023,After purchase I am still in the early stages of getting to know my xbox but so far so good. I would give it five stars but like I said still in early stages,4
12/20/2023,"Plays great, video is awsome! normal price is very very expensive!!!!!!!!!!!!!",4
12/19/2023,Great price! Easy to install and operate. Much faster game play. Good buy!,4
12/24/2023,Console is awsome. supplied controller sucks. I ended up buying a new controller.,4
12/13/2023,"It was a great deal, and it got here on time like it said so great bye",4
12/13/2023,Arrive with great time n look good haven't open yet though,4
12/25/2023,Good experience with online purchase,4
12/7/2023,"Great performance and value, also you cant beat gamepads",4
12/26/2023,a little slow at first but runs percetly fine,4
12/3/2023,I don't need this but it's new,4
2/14/2021,"Graphics are awesome, I purchased for Christmas for my 14 year old and I haven’t really seen him since lol. I watch him play sometimes and it’s like you are right there.",4
11/25/2020,"Load times are incredible, but lots of people are buying for the game Call of Duty Cold War and the problem is that when I play a game, 2/3 times the game will freeze, and 7 seconds after the console will shut off.",4
2/14/2021,"I first purchased a series x December 6th from Walmart walk in. I had it for a month and a half and it suddenly turned off. It would not turn back on, and if it did it was for about 15-20 seconds than it double blinked and shut off. And sometimes it would not even turn on. But, it is a great product when it is working properly without and malfunction!",4
8/17/2023,not as good as I thought haven't played it much,4
8/28/2023,It works well with older games,4
3/29/2023,The console is pretty good so far. Everything works but the controller arrived with jammed LB button. Otherwise it’s good.,4
3/8/2023,would rate it a 5 but my son said the cooling fan on it sounds like a b52 Stratofortress at takeoff.,4
8/13/2021,"My son said the difference in speed is noticeable. He got four 4.0 semesters in a row so this was a promised reward, but the hyper inflated price from the original price was hard to swallow.",4
6/11/2021,Overall great console only 4 stars for shipping because the box got a bit of damage on it. Just lucky it came as it did I guess anyway. Some great features on this console and look forward to some new games to play on it. Gamepass will keep us happy though.,4
12/7/2020,Just powered everything up and all is well. Havent had a chance to experience the high speed functionality but I did want to say that while I was a little upset that my initial order was delayed WalMart did a good job of filling the order and having it delivered in a timely manner. I honestly didnt expect it to show up as quick as it did but WalMart did a good job a rectifying the delay.,4
5/24/2021,"I love this machine. It’s everything I expected and more. Only reason it gets 4 stars is because of the price from this seller. They did however a great job shipping it out and i had it the next day 
The quick resume is amazing. I started up AC Valhalla played for 3 hours. Turned the Xbox off and the next day picked up exactly where I was nearly no load time between.",4
12/9/2021,"The main UI is just a mess. Overly detailed where it doesnt need to be, and not simple for the main features. You can of course get used to it, but its just a garbage UI/UX. That said, games look great. The new Halo Ultimate, so far, is great! It's  a game console, it does the game console things you'd want it to do.",4
6/1/2021,"Package came in great shape! I I wanted to wait a week or so before putting a review up. I upgraded from a One X, and think it was worth it. Only gripe is that I paid for next day shipping which was NOT cheap so I need to see about getting a refunded the extra that I paid for shipping and did not get.",4
2/22/2021,"This console is a huge upgrade from my old Xbox one. It runs very smoothly and fast but one thing that bothers me is when I have to reconnect my controller. If I change my batteries I'm forced to restart my Xbox just to get the controller to reconnect. Other than that, the Xbox runs as expected.",4
5/9/2021,This thing is absolutely flipping amazing compared to my year one xb one. Graffics are outstanding and the quick resume for up to 5 games rocks. Load times are virtually gone compared to the xbox one. Took Wal-Mart almost a month to get it to me that's the only reason for the 4 stars but totally worth the struggle of finding it in stock.,4
1/31/2021,"My four star review is because of the confusion with backward compatible  games. Its not our first time setting up a new Xbox, but Microsoft could have made the set up much simpler by explaining the difference between disc backward compatible games and those purchased online. Dont try putting the disc into the old console to transfer, it wont work. The disc must be installed using the new console even if its a game you played on the old console. The player achievements will show up under your player profile and will not be lost.",4
11/20/2020,"The box came with a huge gash on the top of it like it was dropped somewhere along the delivery, which also damaged the Xbox packaging, luckily no damage to the console. There is a big upgrade in speed of the console and graphics which makes buying this console worth it.",4
6/28/2021,"Series X is everything I was expecting which is both good and bad. The performance gains over the Xbox One X are amazing. Load times are super quick (although not ""instant"" the way some of the hype made them out to be...possibly because I've spent the most time playing older games that haven't been fully optimized). As with any new system I'm sure there will be steady improvement as game developers continually learn to take advantage of the system's full potential however I took a star off because, aside from the performance gains, the overall experience is nearly identical to the Xbox One X. I understand that this is Microsoft's strategy, joining PC, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, in a single user experience, but it does take away a bit from t...",4
8/29/2022,"I disliked the price of this Xbox. Some graphics look awesome, but to be honest I can’t really tell much difference between my old Xbox One S and the Xbox Series X. I dislike the fact that Xbox doesn’t have any decent exclusives, but the for games it does have, it makes them look good. The frame rate is awesome and I love the Xbox interface.",4
11/27/2022,"I had an issue with a game that said it was backwards compatible, so I ended up having to purchase it again (as a digital). Other than that, getting use to the system from the playstation system is a smooth transition on the controller, but it's trickier when sifting through the settings and whatnot. As a ""playstation person"", I would recommend the Xbox X series if you wanted to change things up or just to upgrade. The reason for 4 stars btw is because I had to buy the same game again as mentioned earlier.",4
4/5/2021,I managed to get one orderd on March 18th it arrived the 1st of February but that was expected i was reading online forums and other people had to wait that amount of time to get there's from Walmart as well not a big deal to me though I'm just surprised i managed to get one orderd. When it arrived the box it was shipped in had no padding or anything else protecting the retail box the console comes in also the shipping box was dirty like it had been in a sand Storm some got inside the shipping box and  on the retail box of the console but not in the inside of the retail box. The console is so fast games load in seconds quick resume is a game changer i will have 4 games running at the same time. The console is so quiet i  never hear the fan ...,4
8/22/2022,"The unit is not easy to set up with no directions. It does have a self set up feature, but doesn’t give any instructions on HOW to use the console or How to play a game. No information regarding playing online with other players. 

Even in a 70” TV, it’s hard to read what all the buttons are used for. 

The graphics, however, are amazing. It has 4K resolution and also includes surround sound.",4
9/26/2022,"In the short, while I had the system, I enjoyed it quite a bit. The only issue is when it comes down to exclusive games, Xbox just does not have what PlayStation offers at the moment. The consoles themselves pretty much stand neck and neck when it comes to how smooth they operate.  I actually returned it for a PS5 for the reasons of playing a wider range of games.  I’ll always love the Xbox because I’ve had it for 20 plus years but this time it didn’t quite fit my preference.  Still would 100% recommend to anyone to get!",4
2/4/2021,"The system is beautiful graphics and performance wise. The upgraded games like Destiny 2 and Borderlands 3 run smooth and have short load times. Only problem with this console is that games that come from your external hard drive will glitch when you try to play them. For example, I have Borderlands 3 on my external and I couldn’t stop running into the upgrade bug. Every time I start the game up, It ask me to upgrade when I already did. I moved It to internal and had the same problems. Uninstall and reinstall, still had the same problem. I just ended up unplugging my external every time I play that specific game. Also, the xbox randomly open other games up when It upgrade glitches. So far, my console has only bricked once.",4
12/4/2021,Love the Xbox but definitely doesn't work like it's brand new and doesn't come with the 24moths of gamepass ultimate like it said it did and the controller that it came with is worn and the A button sticks all the time and the box to the Xbox was in was stuffed up an the corners to the box are not pointed like a new box would be luckily I got a 3 year warranty on this thing,4
7/6/2021,I truly got tired of trying caved in and paid more then anyone wants to pay for this but I am happy with it. Happy with the transaction no issues from purchase to delivery. I would purchase from vendor again. Other then that I don’t need to tell you about the XboxX.,4
1/22/2022,"I love the console. It performs exactly as you'd expect. However, when it arrived, the box for the Xbox was pretty deeply damaged while the shipping box was not. Lucky for me it didn't impact anything but I would request more quality when making a purchase like this.",4
6/28/2021,"Great console, definitely an upgrade to my aged Xbox One (OG). However, it's great at the $500 price point, beyond that it begins losing value. I was fortunate to be able to snag one at MSRP, as neither the XSX or PS5 are worth $1000; do your homework and stop feeding the scalpers.",4
5/18/2023,great game consoe my son loves it.,4
4/26/2023,Nice quality however not many quality games but plenty of games to play.,4
4/16/2022,Great Paynent program with Affirm! Received my Xbox with Minh 5 days of order. Awesome graphics but provides the old feel.,4
5/28/2021,Love the faster load times but honestly should of just stuck with my xbox one x. Wasn't worth the $624.,4
12/14/2022,"works great. The only issue is that it took 2 weeks to ship.  delivery date was the same for the hole 2 weeks. when it was finally was late to deliver, it switched to beings on backorder.",4
12/7/2020,"The Xbox is great, amazing resolution, speed, and all around power. The only reason it’s four star is that it was delayed about 5 days, but only took one day to be delivered from time of shipping.",4
1/14/2022,This next gen console is very awesome! The shipping is good because it only took 4 days in order to come! I really hope everyone enjoy this next gen console,4
6/5/2022,"The system is great no complains about it or about the packaging. However, the delivery was bad it was left outside the house didn’t even knock or ring the bell, the delivery guy just left it on the floor and left.",4
9/28/2021,"Product delivered timely and in good working order. The only thing that could have been better is that the product was not snuggly packed. There was some evidence of impact wear during shipping, but not enough to cause concern.",4
7/13/2021,just got my console today loving it so far only downside is its the japan version which can still be used in the us all you have to do is when you set the console up is select english or whatever country you may live in.,4
1/5/2021,I was able to get the Series X on Dec 17th.   It finally arrived yesterday the 3rd!   The system is well worth the money.  Just wish it came before Christmas!,4
4/5/2021,"I'm very excited that my husband and I are proud owners of an Xbox series x, however we received the package opened. The box it came in was thin and the xbox's box had a few minor tears on it.",4
11/28/2022,It looks sleek and nice but it defenetly overheats after 3-4 hrs even on idle but if you dont care then its a great console overheating is real though.,4
2/27/2022,"when i started telling people how much i spent on this purchase, they were shocked. however, it is a highly demanded system and it shipped ahead of schedule and arrived in perfect condition.",4
11/30/2020,transferred games over from xb1 in total about 6 hours 100mb/s internet ant total about 300gb used out of 1tb.  runs games extremely quiet the fan runs amazingly quiet its a beautiful overall design as well same interface as xb1 .,4
12/4/2020,Very good console. quite fast. Not much of a visual update for me even though my monitor is a 4k monitor. Overall only worth the $550 ( including tax) that i paid for it.,4
10/12/2022,"Came fast and in good condition. The best part is it not a scalped price. Idk if this is common but mine said it would take a week to get here,  but arrived the next day after ordering.",4
2/9/2024,"Xbox series x, has been well with the money and become even an investment, that my whole family loves and enjoys, it has given my children something to look forward to, and helped pull them out of extreme depression, having opened doors for them to vent. No Regrets here, the company shipped my Xbox fast, and wrapped it very well, to protect it from damages or being tossed about. Would give them a 5 of 5 as well.  Would purchase again.",5
12/30/2023,"I was on the fence about purchasing the Xbox Series X because I hardly play my PlayStation 4. So far I have been impressed and very entertained by this console. I would say Microsoft made a great device that pacts a lot for someone wanting to play new and older generation games, stream and play 4K films.",5
12/29/2023,"This system, seconds upon booting up my favorite game PSO2NGS (which is heavy on consoles and computers load-wise) showcases its superiority. Gaming is an instant leap in performance. It's like watching water flowing with your naked eye how perfectly the graphics dance across the screen. Load times are non existent, this console is SILENT. The updated controller with textured grips on siding and triggers is a pro touch. The new sharp click-style d-pad is awesome. The set up is extremely easy and walks you through in the most basic of ways. Even the sound quality is leaps and you will notice immediately! I couldn't be more happier and willing to say take advantage of the deal for $370 (after tax) while you still can. But even if you don't ge...",5

12/17/2023,"I aleeady have one in my living room, at this price i decided to get another for my bedroom! 

Some reviews say the price is a scam (not true) you just have to keep checking every 30 min or so until the price is locked in at $349 (not $399 once you add it in your cart, this happened to me several times). Im guessing this is due to wallmart quickly selling out at this price and you have to wait for each wave of restocks.",5
12/15/2023,Works great very fast shipping id like to thank Walmart for the discount with tax and everything is was 372 dollars out the door for a 500 dollar console! Great deal!!! I know I'm a little late to the party I had bought one when they came out but I had to sale. Glad to have one again thanks Walmart for the fast delivery received it on the same day I bought it!,5
1/25/2024,Order this for a curbside pickup and was a bit skeptical based on previous reviews but received it and couldn't be more pleased. Received a brand new Xbox series x for great price,5
1/3/2024,i finally was able to afford the xbox x! when i got the money i got it from walmart and as soon as i placed the order it was available for pick up!! the greatest gift i could get myself and so easy on walmart app.,5
11/15/2020,"What an amazing gaming system, I love how smooth gameplay is. Comparing it to ps5 they are equally matched but I have to say, Xbox’s quick resume is a game changer. The fact that I could be playing some assassins creed Valhalla and jump right into an online match with buddy’s on coldwar in a matter of seconds is amazing! Thanks Microsoft for making such an awesome Machine",5
11/11/2020,"This is a freaking awesome job by the Microsoft team. I can't believe how life like the graphics are. The quick resume is a game changer and I never wanna go back to the old systems. Loading times aren't even hardly noticable and I find myself instinctively grabbing my phone and waiting but there is no time at all to scroll social media like before. The only complaint I have is that I don't have two. If you're looking for some games to really show off the power of this baby, AC Valhalla, NBA 2K21, Watch Dogs Legion, and Destiny 2 Beyond Light.",5
11/28/2021,"I joined Walmart  specifically for this item.  Based on some other reviews, I’m surprised it actually worked.  At exactly 4PM I tried to purchase and it was already sold out. I was placed in a queue with a 24 minute wait time. The screen refreshed on its own when it got to the 1 minute mark and I was allowed to add to cart and check out. The expected delivery date was 12/15. It was delivered by FedEx on 11/26, signature required to thwart porch pirates. It was packaged well with no visible damage. My holiday shopping is done. Thank you Walmart and thank you FedEx.",5
4/7/2021,"Awesome system. Makes my gaming computer with a 1080ti look like a bit of a slouch. I do highly recommend that a headset be in your future. The console is down right fast, instant on is useful. Heck if you want enable developer mode and play retro arch like it was a PC. I highly recommend this product.",5
9/25/2022,"Fast shipping ordered Saturday night and it was here by Tuesday! I’ve been trying to get my hands on this baby since 2020, I’ve had the series s since last July and it lived up to its expectations. I wanted more memory and better fps so when Walmart had the X in stock i didn’t hesitate and copped one. Truly a gamers holy grail Microsoft did their thing with this one.",5
2/16/2023,"Just received my Xbox today on 2/15/23 was a day late, it's exactly as described, Turned on and everything, the box the console comes in is a bit scratched but nothing wrong on the inside everything comes wrapped up and well protected with Styrofoam all around the Xbox to keep in place from getting damaged. I will say maybe placing something inside the brown shipment box that prevents sliding around, other than that everything is great. Ups delivery guy was very nice, I had to sign to receive package which I liked very much he also made sure to ring the door bell and not just leave it on the floor.",5
11/16/2020,"As a long time gamer and avid xbox buyer, i'm extremely pleased with this system. The difference between this console and the OG xbox one is night and day! The first day I played on it I found myself going back to experience what the graphics and gameplay  were supposed to look like on games like Battlefield 1, RDR 2, and Assassins Creed: Odyssey. The look and feel amazing after the upgrade. Ive been playing on 4k TVs since early 2016 and always thought the graphics look dull and to be fair a One X would have helped up the resolution, but I could never justify spending the money just to upgrade that aspect. Extremely pleased in the build and look of the console itself.  I wasn't too ecstatic when the Xbox one came out with the glossy black ...",5
2/16/2021,Xbox series x is amazing.. was delivered to me from Walmart earlier than expected.  You can truly feel the power of the 9th gen. FedEx driver even called me on the phone to make sure I com out and get my xbox safely from him so know one would steal it.. happy to have this console.!!!,5
10/7/2022,"Package came 2 days early which is always a nice surprise, box was untampered with and in turn had everything inside in good condition. As someone who’s owned an Xbox since 2002 I gotta say the Series X is everything I dreamed the next gen of Xbox would be. Extensive and thought out backwards compatibility is this consoles golden crown, shout out Billy G Gates.",5

12/14/2023,"Who else took advantage of the 350$ on the X, %26 138$ for the S on the secret sale today? Thumbs up if you got both and you already have both like me 😀",5
12/7/2023,It almost sounds too good to be true but it came it did happen to come later in the day around 8:42pm PT and because of it being delayed I got a $10 off promo code which I appreciated,5

9/16/2023,"Awesome gaming console! Must have for any Xbox fan! Love the options to match the game in 4K, also love that some original games are backwards compatible with this as well! Also makes an awesome 4K movie player as well!",5
8/5/2023,"Great consul great price extremely capable. I don't understand why Walmart keeps on trying to censor my review but that's a Walmart for you, so this is all going to type.",5
9/29/2023,"Order arrived on time and was brand new as ordered. Was skeptical from other reviews, but more than happy with my order. I've also been playing xbox since the original so maybe i'm just biased",5
8/30/2022,"We had a house fire and I lost my original Series X. I managed to get a replacement, brand new! For retail price. I absolutely loved my original one and I love the new one. Thank you Walmart!",5
9/26/2022,The xbox came 3 days early and came in surprisingly really good shape there where air bags for the packaging non of then where pop so thats good i overall 9/10,5

Great product nothing was wrong or different from how it is supposed to be. Very satisfied with purchase and price",5
12/4/2020,I about had a stroke trying to get this but I got it before it sold out in under a min. Since it’s been here my husband has been focused on it instead of me. Thanks Xbox. I don’t know why I continue to love that idiot but I do. Merry Christmas,5
10/20/2022,"Shipped and arrived in 3 days. The series x is just incredible. It's fast, graphics are crazy. Blows away my one x. Now I have the PS5 and series x, best of both worlds and game pass is incredible",5
2/5/2024,bought this for my son and he loves it,5
4/1/2021,If you can find one get one. Really cool piece of hardware. Super fast can run on my 1440p monitor or 4K tv like a dream. One annoyance is the lack of upgradable internal storage is especially since Sony has been doing it forever but a external drive is an ok fix. You got this! Beat the bots! I believe in you!,5
12/25/2023,It's better with graphics they say it's fast but it downloads slow but still it has alot of space and I love that,5
12/27/2023,"Came in super quickly. I did the setup process, installed my games, and was immediately impressed with the graphics. (Coming from a Series S user)",5
12/21/2023,Got it as an early Christmas/birthday gift for my bf %26 he loves it. I don't know much about games %26 whatnot but he loves it so 😂,5
1/6/2024,"Came intact, beautiful graphics, fast loading! My new addiction!",5
1/11/2024,Excelente fast delivery and safe,5
1/11/2024,"Amazing price, probably the best console out there.",5
1/14/2024,bought for my sister on christmas. she hasnt stopped playing.,5
12/7/2023,"Got it right after Black Friday. With the new GTA announced, this will be an essential for sure.",5
12/9/2023,It Runs Smoothly I'd Highly Recommend This Console,5
12/18/2023,Gamers need to upgrade to xbox x with Walmart specials excellent choice for me,5
12/7/2023,It runs 4k 60fps like it should and the console is actually pretty good with great ventilation,5
12/22/2023,"Great console,came just in time!",5
12/19/2020,"First off, Thank you Walmart for your prompt and professional service.  Secondly, wow.  Gotta say, I’ve been playing on an original Xbox One and it was definitely worth the upgrade.  Most of my friends have moved on to the PC life, which many would agree to do.  But there is just some sort of nostalgia from a console.  I can’t leave the memories of my PlayStation, PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, etc... Combined with crazy frame rates and super fast download speeds this Xbox was for sure another 4-5 year investment for fun just as Microsoft has done for me before.  Thank you!  Perhaps when they are available again I will indulge in the PS5 as well, I love where games are bringing us today!",5
4/8/2021,"Most powerful Xbox ever made! This thing is a real beauty. Coming from an Xbox One X and I can't believe how fast this thing is. Loading games is non-existent and they look amazing. I do wish the OS was different on the Series X, to make it feel more of an upgrade to the next-gen. Outside of the dynamic backgrounds, it's exactly the same. Controller is almost identical to the Xbox One, but a bit smaller and they made a couple minor changes. All in all, I am very happy with the Series X.",5
12/4/2020,"Graphics considerably better the One X, though my SSD is nearly full with 5 ""Enhanced"" games. Recommend a external for older non-enhanced games. Load times are almost non-existent. Easy setup using a smartphone. Controller very similar to last generation, though the textured grips are nice. Worth the $500 Walmart proper sells it for. Approximate dimensions are 6""x12""x6"". Unit is very heavy...a cinder block comes to mind.",5
12/13/2021,"Product is great. The corner of the box arrived with a huge dent so I’m slightly concerned but we won’t know if anything is wrong with it until Christmas. Obviously a carrier issue. 

The restock process was fairly easy to navigate. I got out into a queue that I had to wait about 30 minutes before I could purchase the item. It seemed fair and wasn’t too painful. Better than waiting in a line at the store! Would buy again.",5
11/29/2020,"Although I had to wait so long to get one, and although I was LUCKY to get one... man was it worth the wait and the hassle. Make sure you get your hands on one of these, the performance that this thing is delivering is mind blowing. 9/10 (9 because of how obnoxiously difficult it has been for so many people to get there hands on just ONE of these consoles, while people are able to order 45 at a time to resell.",5
1/6/2021,"This is a very powerful console! My TV is 4K 60 refresh rate for gaming (Samsung) I will upgrade TV later to take advantage of 120 refresh rate gaming but my experience is that even with my current set up, I could tell a difference with improvement with graphics compared to Xbox One X.",5
8/31/2023,5 stars! Works perfectly!,5
10/26/2023,"Interesting design console,fan works silently. Controller comfortably and have feedback",5
11/11/2020,Best Console Hands Down ! All The New Features Just Mind Blown Away,5
8/4/2023,It's a game system..it's what we ever YOU WANT it for.,5
9/3/2023,Fast delivery the same day  delivery A,5
12/29/2023,everything is great !,5
6/11/2023,This Xbox series X! Oh my gosh I literally love this game it's smoother to up 60Fps and 120Fps INCLUDING 4K!,5
11/28/2023,Fast and easy!,5
5/26/2021,The system itself is great! It is quiet the graphics look amazing and switching between apps games and games start up are super fast. Also the shipping was super fast as well. Ordered it Thursday and it was delivered Tuesday.,5
10/30/2022,Love the system. Amazing Gaming experience. All Walmarts are not created equal and ive experienced it first hand. Ordered it on Monday and got it on Wednesday..... AMAZING!!!!!,5
11/13/2022,"Took a total of four hours from placing my order, to having a great associate bring it out to my car hassle free, to hooking it up. Everything worked and updated straight out of the box.",5
7/25/2022,I have been waiting Patiently to have my Series X im glad i got to upgrade it was much needed it. Now i can use my Series S for traveling and my Series X for home use only,5
1/19/2021,It’s an amazing gaming console truly next GEN the controller grips are amazing the controller looks better than it looks the Xbox looks so clean and so nice in person it’s fast it has beautiful graphics everything you want in a gaming console is The Xbox series X with game pass it almost does not need any exclusives you’re trying to download everything because of the great library of game pass overall the Xbox  is great it has no issues and it is beautiful with everything I want in a console,5
12/16/2020,"This console is very impressive. I can't afford an expensive qled or oled tv right now, but that's definitely alright. It plays really well on my m-series vizio and my other standard 4K tv. It is worth the wait. Don't give in to those people that are trying to make a ridiculous profit. That's just terrible. I love the graphics and load speeds. No problems crashing or getting hot. Works great!",5
12/8/2020,"Finally nabbed one somehow. Its early in the consoles life and there arent any killer next gen games yet. Sony has a couple that are worth a look already, but arent much further ahead. I favored Xbox last gen and it may end up that way this time, but Ill need my hands on the ps5 first. Xbox hasnt reinvented the game console this time around by any means. What youre getting is a much more powerful gaming machine, slightly improved controller and much improved system storage. Everything loads very fast, especially last gen games. If you liked Xbox last gen, then youll want the series X. If you didnt like last gen xbox, then series x isnt going to make you a believer... at least yet. Its early! Excited to see what is to come this generation.",5
12/7/2020,"Me and my husband where so happy to get our Xbox Series X that we already had a new game to play as soon as it showed up! We had fun playing the whole day on this video game console! 
I really like the look of the new Xbox Series X, it is very quiet, the games load so much faster and they just look so much better! 
Before we actually received the Xbox Series X we where wondering how different at all it would be, and now that we have it we are so happy with our purchase.
I highly recommend this Xbox Series X game console, it’s faster, nicer, o also really love that my games that i had purchase for the passed Xbox game systems I can still play those games on my new Xbox Series X game console.
My new Xbox Series X has 16GB of RAM, and has 1TB ...",5
12/12/2021,"I ordered the PS5 on 11/29, and it arrived 12/11.  I previously ordered a XBOX Series X on 11/22 and got it on 11/28.  Seeing other reviews - I feel very fortunate to have been able to purchase both and get them quickly. FedEx I. My area works well - sig required for both deliveries.",5
12/16/2020,"Amazing.  I held out on the One X because there had been whispers of this next gen console for several years, so I figured I would just go all in whenever it came out.  I was one of the fortunate few who were able to snag a pre order, and I have been playing daily since launch.  The performance is unbelievable.  There obviously isn't much in the way of Series X games yet, but I have been catching up on some Xbox One games I haven't played, notably Doom Eternal and Control so far.  If those are considered last gen games running on the Series X, I can't imagine how games could look or perform much better.  They look incredibly great, and load times are basically non-existent.  It's just a joy playing.  

Packaging and set up really feel top n...",5
11/29/2020,Have been a PC gamer for a while decided to try it out since it technically can out perform my current laptop as I’m at the point to where it’s time to build a new desktop. I have to say being able to run games at 1440p 120 FPS is nice. I haven’t given in to 4K technology yet but I might when the new LG TVs come down a bit in price. The menus are extremely responsive compared to what I remember of days of old. Pretty awesome so far.,5
12/5/2020,"The Xbox series X is an awesome console, you can really tell the difference from jumping from the old hardware to this new hardware. The SSD makes for super fast loading. The beefed up GPU and CPU allow for the best looking and feeling games you have ever played! 4K up to 120 Fps gaming with high fidelity visuals is simply amazing. Very nice upgrade! I absolutely love my Xbox Series X and along with the Xbox gamepass Ultimate subscription you have over 150  games immediately at your disposal! Great gift or great Present to yourself! You won’t be disappointed.",5
12/1/2020,"This series X is a fantastic upgrade from my original XboxOne. I don't get a new console every time they're released so this has been a great upgrade in every way. It's super fast even with the graphics at top notch. I paired it with an LG BX55 OLED (2020). I love how nice everything looks at 4k and 120 Hz. 
The only downside is the size and dimensions of the enclosure. It's too big in any orientation to fit in my entertainment center with my XboxOne and stereo amplifier. So it's up on top a self. Oh well. Not much I can do about that.",5
11/27/2021,"Excellent experience, loving my series X and was pleasantly surprised to receive it in four days!!!… ordered it through Walmart   Black Friday online sale on Monday afternoon and received mines Friday morning. So happy with the series X too , beautiful graphics and super smooth gameplay… giving my son my series S now…. Finally got the X I wanted",5
12/3/2020,"Great system. Graphical improvement over 4K XBox 1X so far not drastic, but the reduction in load times and simple menu responsiveness is game changing. Even old games see load time reductions, graphical improvements, frame rate increases, and auto HDR! Graphics will continue to improve over this generation, but the SSD for me so far is the greatest leap in tech. External HDD filled with XB1 games just worked automatically when I plugged it in. The hardest part of setup was actually buying one. I've never had to ""work"" so hard to buy a toy. PS5 is great too. Get the one that has the games you want to play most. Both systems make you want to never play your old slow PS4 or XB1 again. I need to get a better 4k TV and a new stand to hide all t...",5
12/12/2021,"Absolutely phenomenal systems, you really need to be playing @120hz. 2k or 4K 120hz will make you never want to go back to 60hz. The series S is an excellent console as well, gamepass is a must have for gamers and parents alike. Just pull the trigger and enjoy your next console for the decade.",5
4/16/2023,Works great. I’m glad they finally had some in stock.,5
3/18/2023,Great Deal and now it went up Lucky to get it,5
6/8/2023,"This is very well packaged! Fast downloads, and lots of storage.",5
5/20/2023,"I luv it came clean and fast, exact delivery place.. all in order, thankfully.",5
5/18/2021,"Best X-Box so far! The load time is great, very fast compare to previous model. Game pass is the best thing in the Xbox. Love it",5
12/28/2020,"Extremely happy with the earlier-than-promised delivery date! Was expecting it Jan 12, and it arrived on Dec 24!!!!! Box was pristine and everything was perfect. Couldnt believe I was even able to purchase online before Christmas!",5
6/9/2021,Answered all questions professionally and friendly. Would recommend. Error on Walmarts part though. For accuracy on shipping. Place your order after holidays and weekends,5
12/18/2020,Walmart delivers on there promises ordered Tuesday Dec 15 revived Dec 18 Friday thank you customer for life A     Happy Christmas here with all the madness out there these days.,5
7/8/2021,"Was FINALLY able to beat out the scalpers and got one at the msrp! Arrived quickly with no issue, and the resolution is beautiful and uploading is so quick!",5
12/1/2020,I picked it up today and got home and set it up. Right away I saw the speed increase by a lot. I had the Xbox one X and thought that was fast but this one blows it away,5
11/30/2020,Lucky enough to get one of these online for Walmarts Black Friday deals for my boyfriend. I was able to pick up a couple days later at my local Walmart and needless to say my boyfriend is ecstatic! Christmas came early :),5
12/13/2021,was trying for a year to get this at manfacturer pricing thanks to being walmart  it happened on the pre black friday drop the machine is amazing literally made me a better olayer,5
12/27/2020,Absolutely impressed with Walmart E-commerce! I ordered this on 17 Dec 2020 with an estimated arrival date of 13 Jan 2021. It arrived on 27 Dec 2020. FedEx delivery which required a signature. Thank you Walmart! You made my boys Christmas brighter!,5
4/20/2021,It improved the graphics in some of my games and it runs so smooth. My games load faster. I really love this system. Have not had a single problem yet.,5
11/30/2023,"The Xbox Series X is a gaming powerhouse! With stunning visuals, speedy game switches, and 4K gaming at 120 fps, it's a must-have for enthusiasts. The 1TB SSD and backward compatibility add to the charm, even if it's a bit big. If you want top-notch gaming, this console is a game-changer.",5
12/8/2023,Shoppers beware of the most powerful gaming console ever made.... Best 4K graphics at 120HZ with UHD 4K Blu Ray player. Needs more storage but other than that great console. It's Fast and Quick resume is awesome. I have over 100 games in my digital collection and the storage expansion card is an easy add on..Just plug it in to the slot and use it. Only thing I don't like about it is it shows every finger print when touched...Overall best console I've owned. See you in game Spartans!!!,5
2/4/2024,"I had an Xbox One before, this one feels smaller in dimension (more cuboid) but much smaller than I expected, which is a good thing.
I got it on the Black Friday sale and the price was amazing.
The gameplay on OLED TV is amazing, ray tracing looks fantastic. I love it",5
2/8/2024,"I'm in love with my Series X! I was upgrading from an ancient 360 that I refused to get rid of and I'm very pleased that I can play most of my old 360 games on my new console! I feel like I can oretty much use this for gaming, TV, and basically as a home computer, so I really only need this one device in my living room. The only downside is that this thing is a beast and takes up a significant amount of space, but I can work with that considering all it does. Very impressed with this console and would have uograded sooner had I known. 11/10",5
2/2/2024,I've owned both ps5 and series x even tried the series s. This is in my opinion the best out of the three. For the price I paid and the games I play can't say the same for everyone. This has given me the best experience no real issues with heat or sound and plays like a champ. I would recommend this console for sure and game pass is a win as well. But at the end of the day my games choices are not yours so what I like you might not.,5
2/9/2024,"As someone who played on Xbox One for many years I delayed upgrading, however I upgraded finally to play new Gen games and have no regretted it even as a casual gamer. The graphics are nice and noticeably better than the previous gen consoles while the system is familiar enough to not have to relearn how to navigate menus and software. If you like Xbox you will like the series X",5
11/26/2023,Love these! They are so beautiful and matched my bday look to a tee. Cute and comfortable,5
10/20/2023,Love this croc brand. Blinged them out for a coworker,5
12/8/2023,Would recommend sizing up for the wider feet girlies like myself. I work long hrs in hospital and these made it with me! Comfortable and easy slide off for break time,5
1/28/2024,I love the look of the baya lined crocs they are so cute and super comfy,5
1/18/2024,Fit is as expected and comfortable. The lining in a nice extra.,5
1/10/2024,First time I purchased lined clogs. Nice and warm on my feet up here in New England,5
12/3/2020,"I wear them everyday. Easy to slip on and leave. Warm and comfy for winter. Can be for style and dressed up a bit, or just thrown on for comfort!",5
12/16/2023,I just love my lined clogs and received lots of compliments!,5
11/14/2020,I would definitely Rex. I love my pair! They do run small so I would size up. I'm a size 8/8.5 I got W10 and they got perfect even with socks. They're so cute. I love the color (purple) and they're so soft and comfy.,5
9/28/2020,Soft and comfy good on cold days,5
10/20/2023,Comfortable and warm..perfect for cold weather,5
10/21/2023,Love these!! Owe of my favorites.,5
10/24/2023,Looks great with my blue jeans and crazy socks.,5
1/25/2024,Love love love so Unique,5
10/6/2023,I love themmmm so much,5
12/7/2023,Love love love,5
11/11/2020,"If sizes are usually a little big for you, consider lined clogs. Initially, lining was soft & ""fluffy"". In 3-4 weeks, lining compressed to give a scosh more room. Forefoot material is the most pliable of 5 styles I've tried and is comfy. Mint is a really fun color!",5
12/27/2020,"I've always had foot pain with back pain and had a hard time standing more then 6 hours without so much pain I got my first pair of Crocks 3 week's ago and have not stop wearing them No more foot ad back pain A true blessing, I love them so much I brought a pair for all 3 of my children 2 pair for my husband And 1 pair for my grandson Truly amazing",5
10/25/2020,I bought these for work as I work in a hospital and am on my feet 12-16 hours a day. These by far are THE most comfortable shoes to walk around in. My feet do not hurt Throughout the day or the next day. The soles are very cushiony are quite flattering as I have received a lot of compliments on the style.,5
11/22/2022,Love that I can match with my daughter. They are super comfy!,5
11/18/2020,The lined Baya are so warm and comfy. They run a little small due to the lining so I ordered a size up.,5
12/27/2020,Very comfortable. I am a size 10 and bought the same size found it to be close but still comfortable. I wear it around the house. Warm and comfortable.,5
1/26/2021,"Very comfortable, but they make my feet look so wide. Only got them to wear around the house. Wish they didn't make my feet like Frankenstein feet because they are so comfy I would like to wear them out. Oh well.",5
1/25/2021,I purchased a size 9. My normal size is a 9.5 narrow. The fit is perfect and my feet are not swimming in the shoes. I only use them as a house slipper. They are very comfortable and I really like the lining.,5
2/12/2024,"I bought them for my dad not really sure he would love them(he's over 40 years old) since he likes more the slippers from his generation, but he absolutely loved them, was happy because were warm but gave him the confidence to use them wherever he wanted without worrying about how to clean them up or if he would feel the cold floor. he likes the texture and firmness of the cross, it help his feet rest from the boots.",5
1/30/2024,"Surpassed my expectations. Remarkably comfortable.  They stay on quite reliably if i arrange the strap behind my heel rather than resting on top of shoe, and they stay on well for most moves either way
Fit well when i wear them with socks, but i should have ordered them one size smaller than my athletic shoe size to fit well without socks.",5
11/30/2020,"Very warm, simple and cute. Will definitely buy another pair in a different color.",5
1/9/2024,I bought these for winter use and they haven't let me down. It was about 20° yesterday and my feet stayed very warm. Warning: always wear socks. I know people who have worn these barefoot and they really start to stink. And they apparently don't wash well. Highly recommend for winter use!,5
1/11/2024,"My son wanted a pair of these crocs with lining, so I ordered a size bigger than the ones he was currently wearing, but they were too small.  I called customer service to get help with exchanging them for a larger size. They were of great assistance and my son was happy to have his new bigger pair in such a short time.",5
1/5/2024,"Great pair of crocks I even use them outside in cold weather, they are very comfortable!! I would buy again but I think these are holding up fine, with the lined inner, I recommend wearing socks with them so your feet do not create moisture from sweat",5
1/5/2021,"I was always skeptical about these, but I decided to try some on they were so comfy. I want more colors.",5
11/10/2021,I love my new crocks. They are fur lines. The only thing is they make a noise when I walk. But I don't care. I love them.,5
1/8/2021,"Literally wear them all around the house, too good to mess up from outside. Definitely getting different colors",5
1/22/2021,I purchased as a gift for someone then had to get them for myself! So comfy and fun to decorate with the jibbitz,5
5/17/2020,They are my favorite go to shoes I do home healthcare part time. I have them in pink and black and going to add more to my collection.,5
12/22/2020,I wear them to work everyday. I work at FedEx and walk about 10 miles a shift . I have less back pain and almost no foot pain now!!!!,5
1/25/2021,"I think these shoes are fun, comfortable and overall convenient for store runs, around the house and more.",5
12/14/2019,"Very comfortable,I'm a size 8.5 in men and ordered these in a 9 and they fit just right.very comfortable I never want to take them off",5
12/25/2020,Got these for my daughter as a christmas gift. She loves the color and the jibbitz as well. She hasn't stopped wearing them.,5
11/19/2020,"Very comfortable I drive for a living and look for shoes that feel good, these are itAnd did I mention very cute",5
10/25/2020,I never thought a simple shoe could be so comfy. I put these on and now they're in the front of my closet.,5
1/4/2021,"Tell them that ""they are a monument to perfection and that they cemented your place in boyfriend history""",5
11/14/2020,I love the way these feel they're comfortable. I wear them anywhere really. They keep your feet warm so I wear thin socks with them.,5
11/8/2020,They're really cute and warm!! I just wish there would be more info on how to clean the fuzzy part when they get dirty,5
12/14/2021,"I purchased a size W6 because I have a pair of J4 their the exact same fit! Stiff at first obviously, just need to be broken in.",5
3/23/2023,"I'm a crocoholic! I love the lined ones. My feet thank me. I wear them everywhere. But alas, I only have 6 pair. Need to get MORE,",5
1/31/2024,They are great to wear around my house. I have stain concrete floors and just throw on to run quick errands. Great quality and trendy. I love them. Thanks.❤️,5
1/29/2024,"I have 5 pair now! Would have more if I could find size and color when looking. Love them with the padding on the inside. Oh, so soft!

A must try for anyone if you've never given them a go. ☺️",5
2/1/2024,Ive wanted a pair of tie dye Crocs but I wouldn't spend the $55 retail. Walmart had a great sale and now I'm styling in my comfy Crocs. The liner isn't removable--keep that in mind.,5
2/13/2024,"They last me 2 years to 3 years depending on how frequently I wear them. Always delighted with the size, comfortable fit and always relaxes me to wear them. Might sound goofy, but these shoes have walked into my life as long as they stick around!",5
11/26/2023,I love them! I love that I can just slip them on and have my feet be warm. They are so comfortable. I am going to look at another color for a variety. I'm not the type of person who goes for pointed heels or tight binding shoes that hurt your feet. I love comfort and a shoe that can also be warn with just about anything. When I take them off I feel like I'm still wearing comfort!,5
12/1/2023,"My first sherpa-lined Crocs. I love them for the cooler weather. I love Crocs and have several pairs (for color choice). These shoes have helped in my recovery from knee pain and subsequent total knee replacement surgery. These are not attractive shoes, but they are fund and they give a supportive base that so the shoes do not cause my feet and legs to hurt.",5
11/12/2023,"I finally needed to replace a pair of CROC lined clogs and took advantage of the twofer offered recently. When I put the black ones on, something is weird about them and they just weren't comfortable. I can't figure it out. The blue ones, on the other hand, went on like my old friends, previous lined CROCS. Go figure. I think it has something to do with the arch on the black ones, but I'm mystified.",5
12/10/2023,"I thought I lost a box of crocs in a move (found it late) but meanwhile was lucky to find these at a great price at Walmart. They look great and are very comfortable. I wore my first pair in Germany that my son's neighbor gave me and since returning to the U.S. I now own at least 9 pair.  Other shoes hurt my feet so now I wear nothing but crocs. As a result of my raving about their comfort, my daughter, adult granddaughter and daughter-in-law are all wearing them too. I am a walking advertisement for crocs!!!",5
12/4/2023,"These are very functional and comfortable shoes! Very satisfied. Took a while to get here though and delivery people are not following my request to deliver at the front porch. They are lazy, not wanting to walk it around … so they leave it in the back by the garage where there is no security cameras and can easily be stolen!!!",5
11/2/2023,"Since I am between full sizes, I have never been able to wear crocs until they came out with the lined ones. With the lining and a pair of socks, these Crocs fit okay. 

I wear Crocs everyday for around the house, walking the dog, and doing errands. Added this black pair to have something a little less colorful than the tie-dye and bright red ones I already own. Good choice. They fit the need.",5
3/22/2023,"I bought these for my grandmother and she is in love. She says ""they feel like you are wearing nothing. It made my calf's hurt for the first week but now, it's like air. I absolutely love them.""",5
1/29/2021,"Great fit, comfortable and warm. Just what I needed to work from home.",5

1/4/2021,Very comfy and super cute,5
12/29/2020,Love these! Order a size up because of the fur inside. These are perfect for this cold weather.,5
12/3/2020,Easy to slip ON and run out the door and LOVE the warm lining. Perfect color/design.,5
2/1/2021,"Use for work~non slipping sole, comfortable lining!",5

3/2/2020,Like the pink one I wear these all the time same comfort all in all 10/10,5
11/24/2020,These were awful. First pair the right shoe liner was bunched up at the toe and the sole was hard like a brick in comparison to the left. I reached out to customer service and they sent me a replacement pair. The second pairs right shoe was labeled as a size 8 but was a full size smaller than the left shoe that was also an 8. I would not recommend. Now I have two pairs I can't wear taking up space because I don't want them going into a landfill.,1
12/16/2019,"Good color,.. design was off, left side was good.. but right side was too small.",1
2/21/2024,"I stood in my doorway at 12:25 p.m. on Monday and watched my phone as the indicator said the package was delivered at that very moment! NO ONE CAME TO MY HOUSE AND I DID NOT GET MY PACKAGE! When I called, I was told to wait ANOTHER 48 hours for delivery and if I didn't get it then, to call them. What kind of policy is that? If the system says the package was DELIVERED, why on earth would someone be expected to bring it in 48 MORE hours? That makes no sense whatsoever!! And calling was NO HELP whatsoever either because all the woman could say was I should wait another 48 hours, then call back. Why even bother? Am I just supposed to be home EVERY DAY waiting on a package that was supposed to be delivered days ago? This is utterly ridiculous a...",1
1/2/2024,"I ordered these for my boy's for Christmas and have yet to see them. Team Lead Dez was of no help. M.Mary signed for them on the 22nd of December at 10:54a.m  and told Dez she returned them, but Walmart has no clue as to where they are. My boy's received charm's for Christmas and no Croc's to put them on. I want to have the same one's sent to me, but I want the same price I paid the first time and now they are $59 a pair I paid $64 for the both of them. Walmart doesn't want to honor that. I had a stroke and can't be dealing with this. I've been to the store three times and I called to talk to the Store Manager Ismail and was put on hold for 30 minutes. I just want my shoes. I've been shopping here before they were here, it used to be J.C. P...",1
1/6/2024,I have always gotten size 9 1/2 but I have  never had a shoe that small.  I wanted to get a bigger size and walmart will not give me a bigger size when I return the 9 1/2. I am appalled at that just because it is a black Friday sale.  NEVER AGAIN!!!!,1
1/4/2024,"Disliked the instep on this Baya style.  the cut is higher, and presses into the top of my foot  when i walk.  Not the same fit as the classic Croc.  The material is also stiffer, and the support is not as comfortable as the Classic Croc.  Price was good @ $29, but not worth keeping.  Returned them.",1
12/29/2023,"Bought this as a gift for my granddaughter for Christmas and I purchased the wrong size. I could send the item back however, I couldn't exchange it for the correct size. I now will be purchasing local for grandchildren instead of on waalmart.com to make sure they can exchange if I purchase the wrong size for them. So the local merchants will be the winners of my Christmas money going forward.",1
12/11/2023,I ordered pink crocs for my wife and when she opened them she laughed at me and informed me she only wanted pink! After being humiliated because I was inept at picking out colors I showed her the order and it specifically said PINK!!!! Walmart sucks!!,1

12/15/2023,"Ordered on Dec 2, 2023... Waited... Received Cancellation notice on Dec 12, 2023. Was thrilled to find these on sale for a Christmas gift I could not otherwise afford. Heartbroken, disgusted, disappointed beyond measure. There is a Grinch at work here.",1
1/13/2024,These Crocs are not the same as the original Crocs I've worn. The plastic is much more stiff. My heels and back were killing me just walking around the house. Beware.,1
1/3/2024,"I returned these crocs on December 11, 2023 as they were too small. Still waiting for the replacement in a size 9, women's. Please advise as to how soon I can expect my order.",1
7/24/2023,"I called to exchange my purchase for a bigger size and it has been a nightmare. The phone had me waiting 45 minutes before I decided to chat live and the person gave me a tracking # and hung up as soon as her message came through. I want the shoes, I want the Baya style so I hope I get them soon.",1
10/19/2023,"I've been wearing croc classics for two years now, they are my go to shoe. I decided yo purchase the baya lined because they were on sale. When they arrived I tried them a week later and immediately hated them. It's like walking on the ground and the sides dig into the sides of my feet.",1
1/28/2024,The shoes are normally great but these have a defect under the liner that make them uncomfortable to wear,1
12/18/2023,Sent the wrong size the first time and than asked for the right size and they sent the wrong one again. I gave up. Asked for a size 4 but sent size 10. Twice. Kept both cause I don't wanna go through the hassle of returning it.,1
12/25/2023,Dissatisfied  that I never recieved them.  And a picture of the delivery was not posted.  Must have been stolen by the courier!  I would like a replacement  pair at no charge!  Please!,1
12/10/2023,The look / color is amazing but the comfort of the baya clogs itself did not work for my feet. They actually made them hurt . I've bought manyyyyyyyyy fur clogs before. But these didn't make my feet happy,1
11/10/2023,"I have been wearing Crocs for years now, and always order the same size. However,  these feel like they are a WHOLE size too small. I'm very unhappy with them because I waited for them to become available and now I have to return them.",1
12/15/2023,"I bought a pair of the light pink %26blue tie dye crocks this past summer. They fit great, just perfect. When I saw these I had to have them. They don't fit . Much to narrow. I am returning them.",1
1/8/2024,My grandchild can't wear this croc. I followed the size chart but should have gone up a size for the furry lining.,1
1/4/2024,"I don't want to deal with a return, but the product has a strong plastic smell that has not gone away for a long time, I suspect it is not original.",1
10/13/2023,Ordered these in the same size as my other lined crocs and they are cut small. Was going to order another pair and return this one at my local store but price has changed from 24.99 to 39.99. If ordering order a size up,1
5/14/2020,"This pair broke the first time wearing them. I tried emailing & calling for 2 weeks, with NO reply, and finally got a reply yesterday, AFTER I already took the shoe into our local shoe repair lady! So I had to pay an additional fee just so I could wear them without the broken strap flopping around. Could be the rivet was bad upon making the shoe but I wasn't happy--especially not hearing back on how to return them.",1
12/24/2023,"So excited to get these for my husband for Christmas!  I ordered a size 12, the package said size 12, the Crocs inside the package were a size 11! :(",1
12/8/2023,I love crocs so I was so disappointed when i got these because I have crocs the exact same size and they fit perfect then these are way smaller,1
12/28/2023,They run very small 😭 this my second pair,1
1/13/2024,returned.  too stiff.  hurt my instep.  not the same fit as my traditional crocs.,1
1/8/2024,The fuzzy lining turns into mush I would not buy this product again!!,1
12/28/2023,I ordered a size 10 and got an 11. this is the second time.   Now I have  2  pairs size 11.,1
10/18/2023,"I ordered my regular size in a Croc...these are too small , my toes are pushed against the toe of the shoe.",1
11/30/2023,I didnt like that I received the wrong size.,1
12/12/2023,I have not received them yet,1
12/2/2023,i ordered womens size 9 and got size 11....,1
12/2/2023,I haven't worn this size since I was  12.,1
12/3/2023,Send me the Wrong Size Whyyyyyy!!!!,1
12/4/2023,They sent me the wrong size. Ordered 9 womens and they sent 9 men's.,1
12/23/2023,Wrong size sent. 2 sizes too big. Here it's the day before Christmas Eve! No excuse!!!,1
12/22/2023,disliked  cuz way to small,1
11/3/2023,The bottom on the handle of the shoe rubs my foot and makes my feet hurt,1
12/10/2023,I have Not received the crocs. please let me know what I  need to do.,1
12/16/2023,run too small have to order again,1
12/22/2023,I was sent the wrong size. 3 sizes too big,1
12/14/2023,I ordered women size 5 and they send me men size 8,1
11/1/2023,Sizing is very small don't fit.,1
6/18/2020,"I didn't even get the product, they emailed me and said the order was cancelled with no explanation and when I emailed them back asking what's going on I never got a response ‍♀️ So I'm rating it 1 star",1
8/8/2023,I had the wrong size and they sent the same wrong size again when they replaced them.,1
10/7/2023,i ordered black and have gotten blue twice.,1
9/5/2022,The strap broke on the second wear. Supposed to be receiving a replacement pair but have yet to receive them. Would not buy again and wish we could have a refund instead.,1
11/29/2022,Ordered these for work where I stand 7-8 hours. Love my classic clogs but wanted something dryer/warmer with same or more support. They did not measure up-very disappointed. Bought in May and didn't start wearing until cool in November. Should have returned!,1
12/29/2020,Pros: They are warm The soles are a bit thicker so I'm taller when I wear them. Cons: The inside can't be removed to wash and these got dirty pretty quickly. They aren't made from breathable warm materials so my feet get pretty sweaty in them. They don't have the same fit as my regular crocs do so they squeeze me on the inside sole of the foot where the strap begins. The sizing isn't accurate. I usually order a 12 croc. I ordered a 13 in these and they're still a bit tight and uncomfortable.,1
5/1/2020,These crocs are incredibly hard and uncomfortable. They are awkwardly wide and make you feel like your wearing duck feet. The liner adds to the overall discomfort... you cannot remove it so they start to smell very quickly.. adding to everyones discomfort. Do everyone a favor and do not buy these.,1
12/28/2020,Unfortunately I am absolutely disappointed in the quality of the clogs I received. Gave them to my husband as a Christmas gift not even 3 hours later the strap comes off. Buying directly from the site I thought it would ensure the highest quality sadly I was wrong.,1
10/23/2020,If you're feet are always hot I would not recommend them they don't dry up and they begin to get very smelly! I looked up the instructions how to wash them and I did so and it's been four days now and they have not dried up because they said to just air dry. No air flows by. Wish The lining would detach so it would be easier to wash. Hope they don't become moldy.,1
5/31/2022,At first glance of this clog it seems beautiful but once you purchase them it's a whole different story the are entirely to small I'm normally a size 8 but had to purchase 2 different sizes a size 9 then a size 10 to get the correct fit just not pleased at all,1
3/28/2020,"I usually love my Crocs, but this pair, for some reason, hurt the top of my foot so bad that I couldn't wear them. I hate to return anything by mail, which is why I hate to buy shoes by mail, but the deal caught my eye and I couldn't pass it up. I gave the shoes away.",1
12/28/2020,So tiny. Definitely like 2 sizes too small. Plus their return process is so bad. Its hard to return it. You can't just exchange it. It came all beat up in the packaging when it got to us. It should've been in a box or something. Company wont respond to our messages. Feel like we got ripped off and waste our money.,1
1/27/2022,This product is a nice idea but in reality they get smelly and there is no way to wash the inside fuzzy area which stops being fuzzy after the second day with no socks. It's so sad I thought this would be fuzzy and stay fuzzy. I wish I could return them.,1
2/5/2020,"I must ordered the wrong size.... either that or the lining made them small. I began to have trouble with the toe beside my big toe on my surgically reconstructed foot after surgery 8 years ago. Crocs had never been a problem but it was either the wrong size or the lining but I had foot pains in the middle of the night. After about a week of spasm and pains I noticed that toenail was all purple. That toe is longer than the big toe and the shoe cuts away more than other crocs. I'm having to be careful about which ones I wear. It is a good shoe, but it was not the right shoe for me.......",1
11/17/2020,"I'm a size 8, this didn't fit at all, it's too small and just not comfortable. They are also so wide looking. It looks funny. Very disappointed with crocs",1
12/8/2019,Very disappointed! I:ve purchased Crocs in the past and they were lovely. The 2 pairs which I recently purchased are pretty bad! Don't fit properly! Now I have to re-pack them and send them back! No more Crocs for me!,1
2/20/2023,I loved my old Baya's. They fit my wide foot. I was so excited when I found these. They are not the same. Not wide and they run small. Will be returning.,1
1/1/2021,"I have had a terrible experience with shipping. It did not come on time as notifications email. I had to contact customer support to have it resend. But, I still didn't get the right size as we discussed.",1
11/30/2021,"After wearing these for a week the fleece lining came loose. Now when taking the crocs off the lining gets stuck to my foot. I would expect crocs to hold up longer than a week, considering I only wear them in the house.",1
12/3/2022,I'm returning them cuz quality!it feels like plastic & cheap not like the tel crocs..so disappointed with my purchase.I will never buy them again.so dissatisfied,1
12/18/2019,I ordered a size larger for me and my son because I figured they would fit smaller. They still didn't fit. Also the customer service SUCKS! It took 2 weeks to ship. I called multiple times and emailed at least 3 times and didn't hear anything back.,1
12/28/2020,Ran small! Ordered a men's 9 for a man who usually wears an 8-1/2 to 9. There were none left in stock to exchange for a larger size. No gift for him in the end. Very disappointing.,1
3/20/2022,"I ordered the same boot and shoe size I normally wear and they are too small. Unfortunately, I disposed of the tags and all shipping documentation in order to return them. They are essentially useless and I've wasted nearly $70.",1
2/12/2020,"TOO small with the liner inside, I sent them back to return them and still 30 days later NO refund to my account, this is way to long to refund someone.",1
1/25/2020,Overall my step daughter loves her Crocs but the process of receiving these were a hassle. I will recommend you just buy them in store than to deal with this site!,1
12/25/2021,I don't wear my crocs everyday or extended amounts of time when i do wear them but they squeak and not from the strap but somewhere at the bottom under the fur. It's so annoying ‍♂️,1
3/20/2022,Not so Happy I ordered size 6 for women but what I got is way too big and too wide for size 6. So dissapointed My other pair is not too big and wide and which is also the same size .,1
5/18/2020,"Rubs the inside of my feet. Unfortunately they're not wearable. They do feel soft and if they were a size larger and didn't rub, I think they would be really comfortable",1
12/12/2021,I use them as everyday wear and the fur on the inside has already worn down it feels rough and nasty and holds a very stinky smell definitely would buy again just without the fur line.,1
5/22/2020,"Not happy. I ordered my normal Croc size 7, but this product ran short! I returned them for a credit. I would have ordered an 8 upon my return, but there were none in inventory, in any color!",1
1/25/2020,They don't fit right. One fits and the other is super tight across the top of the foot. Like it was made wrong. I have always loved crocs until I got these for my daughter for Christmas.,1
2/21/2023,Had to return 2x just didn't fit the width of my foot properly. The band kept digging in to the side of my foot. Very uncomfortable. So I decided to change croc styles all together.,1
10/3/2020,They're cute. But lining doesn't make a difference. And I took websites instructions to ordering size and it was wrong. Was too much of a hassle to send back so guess they'll just sit in the closet,1
12/15/2021,Hi i herd they were super comfortable..but the right shoe on top hurts my foot...gave them to my daughter who owns crocs she says something wrong with them same thing on her top of shoe on right foot actully made a sore on her foot...,1
3/18/2021,When I got the shoes they were messed up and bent up them were also really small which was kind of weird because I have the white ones and they came perfect,1
9/22/2021,"They are not sized the same as the rest of the Crocs. So, they do not fit properly. The company doesn't support an easy exchange process. It's time consuming and costly to solve the problem.",1
10/25/2020,The fur in them lasted a day I'm very disappointed,1
5/14/2020,Not true to size! I ordered a size larger and still does not fit!,1
5/18/2020,Runs narrow. Bought one size larger than what I normally wear and still did not fit.,1
12/30/2020,"Wrong size from Online purchase, had to exchange in the store. Took 3 different stores to find an exchange, but turned out perfect!",1
4/4/2021,Took almost three weeks to be delivered and didn't fit. Took to a croc store to return and the people were unhelpful and rude.,1
12/24/2019,Shoes were too small wasn't able to trade out the shoes for the right size for the same Black Friday price,1
1/20/2021,"Crocs in my size fit perfectly. The lined crocs run small, almost 2 sizes smaller. Trying to exchange them for bigger size and everyone is sold out.",1
12/31/2020,"I had to send these back. The Crocs I HAVE, have a great arch support system. There was very little (if any) in these.",1
1/22/2021,Does not fit too small my mom is a size 8 and it fits her perfectly I bought a size 12 and it doesn't even go half way,1
1/27/2020,The crocs that I received the size was mislabeled. I ordered a women's 9 and that is not what I received. Will not order again ☹️,1
4/29/2021,I have a pair of size 13 crocs that are too big so I bought a pair of size 12. They are too small. I gave them to my son who is a size 11.,1
5/18/2020,"They are lined with fur, I live in Florida I don't need fur. I was looking forward to receiving them and very disappointed when they arrived.",1
11/28/2021,"Much larger than regular crocs so they look kind of funny in my opinion, snug fitting but big at the same time.",1
12/3/2022,Definitely smaller than expected. The other pair feel much better. The quality of the inner part of the crocs are not good at all.,1
2/1/2021,"Although I have quite a few pair that are not lined that I wear during the winter, I am so happy that I have lined ones now!",1
10/10/2020,Disappointed I wear a 9 baya lined now and this new pair didn't fit. I also bought a 10 and they didn't fit. Very disappointed.,1
1/27/2022,These weren't the classic lined crocs I was looking for they're too bulky & make my feet look huge! I had to return them.,1
12/24/2020,Did not get my crocs. Could not track my crocs. Email doesn't work to log into register but somehow got an email saying I received my crocs,1
2/19/2023,"The item was irregular, one croc was wider then the other . I was happy because you refunded my money.",1
11/29/2020,Nice and warm in the cold but the lining is coming apart stitching coming apart.Not as soft to walk in as the crocbrand clog.,2
1/8/2024,"Disappointed with the inconsistencies of your sizing. I have had a pair of size 12 for a few years that fit great. I ordered size 13 like your sizing suggested, because they are lined they are small. I put the two pairs bottom to bottom, they are the same length.",2
11/8/2023,"I bought my size but since my feet tend to push forward when I walk they hurt the tips of my toes pretty bad. I sent them back and bought a size up in the Literide Crocs which  are a bit big and work best with thick socks or double socks, but quite comfortable after I got used to them which only took a few days. I like the Literides. They seem to be helping my plantar fasciitis.",2
1/25/2024,Those don't fit well. I didn't realize they're made smaller and didn't see the smaller size disclosure upon purchase. I only wear them occasionally around the house but cannot wear them when out and about. Three-Thumbs-down!,2
12/26/2023,While these were very nice the sizing was incorrect. I ordered a women's size 7/men's 5 and they were so small. They seemed to be a women's size 5. Now I have a very disappointed little girl because they are sold out.,2
12/5/2023,These shoes are nice but I think they would definitely would cause me to fall. I need to return them  and get my money refunded. Do I just return them to my local Walmart?,2
1/9/2024,"I have purchased the same item multiple times before but this pair is way to large and sloppy, can't wear them.  I'll be working on a return.",2
10/14/2023,"I like everything about these except for they're too wide, it feels like I've got a big bulge on the front of my foot, it's a little awkward, too wide for my liking",2
12/18/2023,They're good to keep your feet warm but aren't too comfortable they're hard as a rock no matter how much I wear them,2
12/6/2023,These were supposed to be for a guy but I ended up giving them my female cousin because they were super narrow.,2
12/17/2023,These are crocs but these ones run big!  Ordered normal size but they are a size too big. Can't exchange them because they are out,2
1/12/2024,They are warm but you should make it so the lining comes out to wash like they use to!!!!!!,2
10/14/2023,"When wearing the crocs. The lining is slipping.
Don't think that is normal. Wondering if they are faulty.",2
12/26/2023,"bought 2 pair, the tie die are way smaller than the black.",2
12/18/2023,These are not what you should expect in Crocs. They are sized oddly and uncomfortable.,2
12/18/2023,These seem about 1-2 sizes too small.,2
11/1/2023,"Holes with lining, blocks stuff stepped on that cannot escape while trying to clean",2
12/14/2023,I like them but they're small in width and my feet are narrow.. so yea 🙄,2
12/2/2023,Great price great material just runs small gotta up size,2
11/10/2023,I put a different size and it came in another size,2
3/12/2023,The lining was bunched and did not fit correctly. I have to return them. Plus the size was smaller than her other lined crocs.,2
3/23/2023,"It trots a long time to get my delivery. Also the sizing is not what I wanted is is a 4m,6w in the past when I ordered I got 6/7, which fit great",2
3/31/2022,"Not great, I've ordered 3 pair of crocs, but only one out of them is what I ordered, I ordered a size 11, and for some reason, I got a size 9. The last time I called to get help, you guys would not except anymore orders fromyou guys. But I love them even if I never wear them again. Thanks crocs.",2
11/11/2020,"This was my first purchase of Crocs. I was so excited to get them only to be disappointed by the bulkiness of them. I love that there comfortable but I completely due not like how huge/ wide they make my feet look. At first I thought it was just me so I decided to wear them anyway instead of sending them back. As time went on and I seen how other peoples look on their feet, I realized that this is not how they should look. I even thought that maybe I had ordered men shoes by mistake so I look at my order and it said women. I don't know, I just no that I am disappointed.",2
9/14/2020,"my wife ordered this shoes but noticed the left shoe was slightly shorter than the right which caused her heel to rub and press on the heel outer lining ring of the shoe. She said it did not feel very comfortable and also noticed the clothing material was starting to come off the heel as a result. She returned them to the store. She said the right shoe which fitted properly was great, too bad, she really liked this but ended up getting different type of crocs which fit properly.",2
1/11/2021,"I bought these to wear only in the house on hard ceramic tiled floors. They are so ugly, so wide which is why I would never wear crocs in public. However, they are very warm since they are fleece lined and they do give me support on the hard floors. They are a bit small for a size 7 and I am a true 7 in women's shoes.",2
7/9/2020,I bought these in a men's size because I needed wider shoes (I am a woman.) . I had surgery on my left foot recently and I needed something bigger secondary to the swelling. I found these to be too narrow where the back strap was attached. Taking the strap off didn't make it any better so I finally gave them away.,2
11/28/2020,I wear the product on a daily bases like seriously kind of an issue wearing jeans and crocs everywhere lol but at first they fit well but after wearing them daily the ware on them makes the size feel a bit bigger which im not a fan of because now ill have to buy them a size down and the strap on them is a bit loose,2
5/14/2020,"I am a healthcare worker, I purchased these in hopes of wearing them for work to lighten the load on my other shoes during the pandemic. Unfortunately they are two sizes too small. So when purchasing please keep in mind to go into a store and try a pair on before purchasing so you can get the correct size. When I purchased them I was not going on stores due to the pandemic and my status as a healthcare employee.",2
3/3/2020,I ordered a size 12 (I wear a 10 1/2 Army combat boot and the Crocs are too narrow and rub the sides of my feet. The material seems much harder than an old pair of Crocs that I have worn out so they flex less and both the edge of the shoe and the rivets that hold the strap on rub and cause blisters on my feet.,2
1/7/2021,I have lined crocs from years ago and they have been my favorite 'go to' shoe after skiing all day. My new ones are not as cozy and the heel feels like the shoe will slip off. First I thought I ordered them too small. I can feel the plastic on my toe. They actually kind of feel big on the sides because of lack of lining 'cush'. If I get a larger size I think my foot would slip out. All my crocs are the size I ordered. My old ones are so different I will continue to wear them. I am bummed because the tread has worn down and they have become slippery. I think I will wear the new ones once in awhile? They are not the same,2
6/7/2023,The strap broke after wearing them for only a couple of hours :-(,2
12/13/2019,"These do not fit or feel like other Crocs I have worn. They are slightly short, and the soles are flat and hard, but they are warm which is at least a plus.",2
12/12/2022,"Was very disappointed! I ordered my normal size and when I received them they were much smaller, so I needed to return them and got money back. When I went to reorder no longer had the larger size.",2
9/19/2021,Just got these and they are too tight. Can't wear them. I have three other pairs (same size) that fit great. Two pairs that are size 8 and lined but new pair is too small. Very unhappy.,2
4/22/2020,"I love the look, color, softness but unfortunately were made rather small. Considerably than the other pair I bought. The rep I contacted made it right with a different pair as larger size was unavailable so I'm very happy wire their guarantee!",2
11/11/2021,These Crocs are pretty tight and make my feet sweat a lot. I wish I could purchase the lined Freesail Crocs again. I loved them and completely wore out my last pair. They are so much more comfortable than the Baya style.,2
11/8/2020,"I bought the size I always wear and they were a little small. The back of the one was formed weird and rubbed on my foot. Unfortunately I threw the packaging away and I'm stuck with them. They're really cute though, wish they worked for me!",2
11/10/2021,I really liked the look of these shoes but they were very narrow in the toes and even more narrow in the top of the ankle. I even went up a size and they were still very narrow.,2
12/6/2020,The product isn't sized correctly so while the extra cushioning is very comfortable your foot slides around making it uncomfortable and hard to walk through,2
12/12/2019,"The length (women 8) is fine, but the width is very snug and tight. Compared to an older Baya pair I own the width is definitely less generous. Disappointed.",2
11/28/2021,"Well this time around I received the color I wanted, only problem with this croc that I have I should've ordered a size up my foot is basically hanging outside the croc because it's lined.",2
12/6/2020,They run very small to size. I ordered a half size larger and I still couldn't get my foot into them. I ended up giving them away so for me it was a total loss.,2
12/28/2020,They are not true to size (too small) and will have to be returned. The base material is not as soft as the original lined Croc these were supposed to replace.,2
11/10/2021,"These Crocs are warm for sure. But, unfortunately, the left one doesn't fit quite right and it presses into and rubs on the inside of my left foot when I wear them. I've tried to stretch them out to no avail.",2
12/19/2020,"I used to have a pair of these and they fit great.. Seems as though one of the crocs is smaller than the other, bummer. Don't think its meant to be like that.",2
5/9/2020,I got the biggest size possible for women and it's still too small. It's hard to not have the same colors and styles that the women would get in woman sizes instead of having to size up to men's and sacrifice style,2
12/23/2020,I bought these to wear out but they are so much wider than the regular clog that they look ridiculous. The lining is kind of a cheap material that became matted after only a couple hours of wear. I wouldn't buy these ever again.,2
9/20/2022,"I bought this for myself, and against the reviews and sizing of this item, when I received it the pair of crocs were too small and too tight for me. Unfortunately, I did have to return it. However I do love the comfort of the lining",2
10/24/2020,I love the design but i ordered up one size and they were still too small,2
5/9/2020,"They looked great and easy to clean for work purposes, but J has to return them because they were to big..",2
11/15/2020,"These have the lined fur, I purchased my size but they are smaller than crocs without lined fur. I should of purchased a size up. Cute though",2
11/26/2021,Runs small... go a size up since it's lined. Please put this in the description for future customers.,2
11/20/2021,"Super cute & warm. But very very stiff & uncomfortable. For someone with a wide foot, these were not for me.",2
12/18/2020,They do not mold to.your feet like the classics do. It's sad because i own quite a few pairs of classics.,2
4/16/2022,"I am normally a total croc lover, but these are not my favorite. They rub the inside of your ankle area and make it uncomfortable to wear them.",2
10/23/2022,The lining is already thinning and going to have holes. I got size 12 and still tight. I normally wear 11. Won't buy again,2
5/3/2021,They fit well but the fur on the inside has already starting separating from the shoe. I will be returning these for the normal version of the shoes.,2
5/14/2020,They are not true to size..I have had many pairs of crocs and always get the same size 12/10 Men's and these are too tight.,2
12/11/2022,Not true to size. Can't fit who i bought them for and not enough time to send back and wait for new ones before Christmas. Definitely a bummer,2
12/21/2021,"I love my fleece lined Crocs, but I wore the fleece out. I wanted me ones. These fleece lined Crocs have a third of the fluff. Bummed.",2
1/25/2020,Took a little over 2 months to arrive. Run small. Fur seemed cheaper quality than previously purchased pair.,2
12/14/2019,I have been wearing a women's 7 for years... These Are sooo small. I ordered 3 pairs. This is the only pair that is too small.,2
5/16/2020,"These are nice looking, however the cloth lining doesn't stay flat to the shoe and hurts my feet. i can only wear with socks.",2
12/9/2020,"So far I've worn them once, because I don't like how the fuzzy lining feels. The lining is not as soft as I thought it would be.",2
9/12/2020,I didn't try these on until last week when it got colder and they are too small. It seems that the extra lining makes the shoe smaller.,2
1/2/2021,One crocs is smaller than the other. . They both states the same size but one is tighter/ smaller than the other,2
11/30/2021,"The lining is warm, but the footbed is less cushioned. Also the sides hit higher near the ankle, which rubs annoyingly.",2
3/6/2021,"Much too big because of the extra upper. Could have used a smaller size, but I've consistently gotten 8's.",2
11/28/2020,I should have bought a size larger. I have normal to narrow feet. The crocs run small/narrow that the side clips rub on the sides of my feet raw,2
1/14/2021,They are too big but the exact same size as my other crocs that fit perfect fine and the design is ugly. The lining is the only good part.,2
4/11/2020,Not happy with these since they came pinched together and have set in that shape. So now they chafe the sides of my feet.,2
12/26/2020,The right shoe seems to be mid-sized. It is tighter than the left. I wish I could get my money back as I have no use for shoes that hurt my feet.,2
5/6/2020,I use these as my house slippers but they are small compared to the regular clogs and they are very hard not flexible enough.,2
12/14/2021,After using for a few days my Internet and it able arts are sore the strap buttons are the cause not happy,2
4/1/2021,They looked great but the size was way off. I could not even get my foot into it. I was very excited and looked forward to these.,2
12/29/2020,I had to return as they were far too small. They were marked as an 11 but probably fit closer to a 9.5 or a ten.,2
12/13/2020,Very small for size 13 I have regular crocs in 12 that fit great so I got lined one in size up think b perfect but barely fits foot,2
1/25/2020,Fur made the fit too small. You need to order up a size,2
12/12/2019,Wrong size too sad -no exchange process.,2
5/17/2020,did not like these as the fur lining makes them slip off when walking.,2
1/27/2020,They did not fit. Waiting for refund,2
12/21/2020,"Bought these for work, as I'm mostly on my feet but they really aren't that comfy...",2
5/4/2020,"These run SMALL. If your shoe size is 10, order size 11.",2
1/2/2021,They are big & clumsy looking. I am dissatisfied with them.,2
3/1/2023,Not as comfortable as my black fleeced but they're ok,2
12/12/2022,The side latch hurts a little on the foot sides,2
12/28/2020,These run about a size small wish I would have known before ordering,2
12/31/2020,They were to small and I couldn't order them in another size,2
12/8/2022,"This style runs pretty big. Shipping took forever, they are really slow......Second time purchaser",2
1/27/2020,"shoes are fine, service with delivery was unacceptable",2
3/7/2020,A size too small like what the reviews said I should of bought a size bigger...,2
11/22/2020,The little bumps on the inside sole hurt the bottom of my feet.,2
12/26/2022,Small and tight. Should advise people to go a lot larger,2
1/21/2020,The size is a bit small and the inside material makes my foot slip out when I walk.,2
5/1/2020,The strap on one of the shoes broke. Is there some way of replacing it? Please let me know.,2
3/4/2020,Tighter than expected. Not comfortable.,2
11/8/2020,The lining in the inside is already causing holes after a week of barely wearing them :(,2
1/13/2021,Not happy with getting the lined one. Too hot and static inducing.,2
2/22/2020,returned because not a true size 10....had to get an 11.,2
12/15/2023,"These crocs with lining are smaller than your normal crocs. I own quite a few and was surprised at how much difference there was with this pair. Also, when my crocs got shipped they were pushed in quite a bit on the left side.  2 weeks later and they still have a dent in them. Colors were sharp and lining was nice.",3
9/30/2023,"These crocs are very wide. I purchased these crocs in the same size, both black and white and side by side these look like clown shoes. Still comfortable though.",3
11/16/2023,Comfy. But a little too big. I bought the size 9 first and they were too small. So I returned and bought a 10. They are too big. Bummer.,3
11/4/2020,I would like to return for a bigger size. I brought a size 9 but my toes hit the front of the shoe. I need a 10,3
11/14/2023,I own several pairs of the lined Crocs so when I saw these and the great price I didn't hesitate to buy. The quality is great but they run a tad small which surprised me because I've always  bought the same size with no issues. Not sure if this was a defective  pair but I'm just sharing my honest experience so people can decide  if they want to purchase and try anyway. Reason I recommend.  I would have returned them but I wore them for a few hours. They're sitting in my closet.,3
1/12/2021,There should've been a size 11.5 Bc my this 11 is too small and the 12 is too big,3
4/12/2021,Everyday wear. Go up 2 sizes due to lining.,3
1/7/2024,I think the fur lining makes them run a little small but if you size up one size they'd be perfect…after I returned and got a size up they are comfy and great I'd definitely recommend!,3
1/24/2024,"If you're used to having Croc's that are cushioned, do NOT buy these. These conform to your foot like you would expect but add no comfort as far as cushion goes. Different than shoes I have purchased in the past.",3
1/8/2024,they were nice but the fleece quickly got nasty and crusty like within a week of using them. got them for my sister not for me.,3
1/14/2024,"They run very small. I ended up giving them as Christmas gifts to my nephews, which was a plus I guess.",3
3/8/2023,Not as comfortable as they used to be. The sole is harder than my old ones,3
12/7/2023,"One shoe hurts badly on where the strap is attached to the insides. The inside should be covered with fur as well. 
Killing my ankle.",3
2/1/2022,"I use them daily. Their comfortable for the most part. However, my feel still manage to get cold.",3
12/28/2023,"Run smaller than my size, not comfortable.",3
3/23/2023,Not sure why this one fits different but it barely fits and would have been better to go a size up since there's no half size. It also hits me on top of my foot in an uncomfortable manner. The color is beautiful and the warmth is amazing.,3
11/2/2023,I normally wear size 8.5 so I sized to 9 and they are still half size small,3
11/2/2023,"I got one with fur and one without fur, both the same size, but this one doesn't fit as good.",3
5/27/2020,"Comfortable I bought a second pair thinking that the one was defective. I had the same problem as the first I will not purchase anymore of these. All others I've had no problem cute, colorful, comfortable.",3
9/30/2023,Not true to size. Run a bit small,3
9/16/2023,Shoes were very nice. However they seem too small for my toes,3
10/16/2023,The footbed was not quite as comfortable as I was expecting it to be but it'll do,3
10/12/2023,I guess its because of the lining but they felt tight had to return and get a bigger size.,3
9/7/2023,They're good. Doesn't feel like the normal crocs though,3
10/21/2020,"I really loved them when they first arrive. But after only a few short days, the fluffy inside was worn down to practically nothing. Very disappointed.",3
12/17/2022,"Very comfy but a bit small! I'm usually a size 9 . I ordered a size 9 , when I wear my crocs without socks they fit great. If I wear socks I can feel the front of the croc with my toes . I really wish CROCS DID HALF SIZES . If I size up to 10 there TO BIG . I would give 5 stars IF they offered HALF SIZES .",3
1/10/2021,"When I saw this I was very excited to purchase this item. When I received this item I was let down because it did not fit. I have wide feet, so I could get the full experience on this pair. I have to stick with the classics since they fit a little better.",3
10/8/2020,"appear much larger than other crocs i have, but fit is fine due to the lining. the lining is very warm, a little too warm for my liking, but overall comfortable. I won't be wearing them out of the house though since they are considerable larger in appearance that others and look like i have clown shoes on.",3
11/20/2020,"THEY ARE SO BULKY!! I got the ""baya"" ones because they looked sleeker than the regular ones...wrong. I look like the characters at Disneyland with the huge feet. They look bigger than my husbands regular crocs and he's a size 12 in men and im a 9 in women's...so yeah I'm super disappointed.",3
12/30/2020,"These definitely look great and their texture is awesome but like the other reviews say, these definitely come in a smaller fit so if you want to buy these I'd say you order at least 2 sizes bigger than your usual size so they can fit you nor too big nor too small",3
12/15/2019,"A croc is a croc is a croc. The kids love them. The price was right, so I bought them. My only issue was the processing/shipping time and absolute lack of communication by the company in regard to the two week delay between order time and shipping time. Can't guarantee I'll order from the website again, especially around the holidays.",3
1/29/2021,"Use it daily to walk the dogs in the cold weather. Size is off (a bit too snug. I'm guessing that it is because of the lining). Back of foot rests on the raised ridge at the back of the clog, so not comfortable. Hardware on which sling is attached to the clog, hits and pinches the inside of my left foot. Unfortunately, does not come in half sizes and I'm sure the next size up will most likely be too big. I wear a size 11 and these are my 5th pair of Crocs (all the previous ones were the traditional clog and they all fit well). I currently have both the traditional clog and the lined clog in 11. The lined clog runs small as described above. Still waiting to see how long the lining holds up over time.",3
9/21/2021,"Was looking for a warm clog for the upcoming cooler weather and this seems to fit the bill. Not sure if it will slip on wet grass or deck yet. Liner is warm without overheating, but everything sticks to it - dried grass, leaves, pet hair, etc. Does run Small, so size up.",3
1/26/2020,"I planned to use it outdoors, but my feet get sweaty to easy. Because of that, I don't like the fact that I cannot take the lining out for cleaning (or am I uniformed that I can?). So now I just wear it around the house or when I go out for quick runs when it's cold out. Also, at first, it fit too tight, (tighter than my 2nd pair which was the same size), but after some time of wearing, now it seems to fit a little more comfortably. I was also looking for them to have a little more arch support than they actually have. Otherwise, & I love the Navy color, having a little heel guard (so the foot doesn't slip back) and the band, being able to wear it up/or down.",3
1/21/2021,"These fit well and I love the furry inside, but they aren't as ""cushiony"" as I expected a Croc to be. Very firm, not soft. All that is ok, but I actually bought them specifically to wear around the house because my feet are having issues and I need very soft souls to walk on inside on our tiled home. But to wear to work and around town, they're good! It's just not what I bought them for.",3
3/5/2020,"As many have said, these run very small. I wear an 8 in the classic clog, and it's a little big. (I could probably go with a 7) But an 8 in these are way too small. I sold them so I didn't have to deal with the hassle of returning. I wish crocs were consistent with sizing.",3
11/9/2021,"I am using these lined Crocs wear after swimming. I like how lightweight they are and that I can wear them safely on wet surfaces.They keep my feet warmer than my flip flops in the colder weather. A big problem is the rivet that holds the heel straps to the left inside shoe, which rub on the instep and cause pain. Any solutions?",3
12/16/2020,"I love the color but these are not as flexible as a normal unlined croc. The heel area is hard and I especially ordered Croc's for heel cushion that these did not deliver. Warm like a slipper they work for outdoor wear, but do need to be more cushiony for my liking.",3
12/26/2022,"Pretty sure the strap on one is for a different size. The straps don't match. Disappointing! I didn't realize it until I'd already worn a few times. They're very warm, but I feel as though they are already starting to wear out with a week or two of wearing them around the house like house shoes. The fabric is starting to unattach at the heel area.",3
12/30/2020,"I loved the shoe itself, but sadly it is too small. I wish Crocs would make 1/2 sizes. I also find it frustrating that there is not an easy process for exchanges online. The product now is no longer available on the website. It seems odd that there would be such a small supply of inventory.",3
2/27/2020,"I work in an operating room and use my Crocs there. This is my second pair of Crocs and have a problem with these that I didn't have with my other pair. They are different models, but both are lined. With this pair the edge of the Croc that over the top inside of my foot rubs my skin to the point I had to put a bandage on my foot to protect it. I already had on thick athletic socks and the Croc is lined so I certainly didn't expect this. It didn't rub my foot raw right away, but after 6 hours the skin on my foot was red and sore. Undoubtedly, if I hadn't put the bandage on, I would have rubbed the skin raw.",3
12/15/2020,These shoes shouldnonly be worn if its cold. Not even for a house shoe! They are comfortable but they make my feet sweat something terrible. I purchased them to wear at my second job but had to taje them because i was afraid the sweat would ruin them. I dod wear them to run errands because its chilly here in Michigan and they were comfortable,3
9/30/2020,I use these on a regular basis. I thought the lining would be a little more thicker especially for the price of them. They are already worn down so it seems not great quality for the price. They are comfortable just disappointed in the lining and i really was looking forward to that part. I was also not happy with how they were shipped. They were shipped in a bag with all the hanger tags on the cros which due to the shipping deformed some of the holes on them. Just kind of disappointed because cros is a well known good company and this was my first pair and was excited and got disappointed from the time it got delivered.,3
11/19/2020,So I ordered my size but when I wear socks with them it feels like my feet are pushed to the front causing them to hurt my toes and feet I strongly recommend u order the next size up if ordering these just because of the lined clog it takes up the extra room inside the crocs,3
10/31/2020,"Run large. The lining doesn't stay up at the edge of the clog either. It isn't worth the hassle of sending in the shoe to try a different size. I truthfully would rather keep them and barely wear them (Once a week or so) than to be told I can not return them, which is what I would rather do.",3
1/6/2022,I had ordered these thinking that they would fit like my other Crocs and I was WRONG. They are tight on the top of my feet. I purchased them when I dropped a bookcase on my foot and it was swollen and in pain. The pair that I bought were uncomfortable and hard to wear. I'm sad that they aren't working out.,3
4/15/2022,"I bought 1 for my husband and 1 for myself. This is our first time ordering online. We have multiple pairs from the insulated to the regular and these are by far the worst. Our old insulated crocs were worn out & had looked forward to a new pair, but the rubber is very stiff and almost has a plastic feel. The right croc on my pair did not have the insulation all the way to the top to the upper part of the shoe, so it rubs against the top of my foot and pushes down where my ankle meets my shin. VERY Uncomfortable and super disappointing!",3
11/11/2021,These lined clogs were bought for my son who wore regular crocs throughout the summer. He also enjoyed wearing them at college during the fall. So we thought the lined ones would carry him into winter. They are very narrow and not as comfortable. You can't remove the lining so I'm guessing they will start to stink. Unless something changes we will probably not buy another lined pair.,3
12/27/2020,"I purchased these Crocs with the lining because of a recommendation. I have another pair that aren't lined. For some reason these clogs look much wider at the front than my other ones, almost clown like wide. I was hoping the lining would provide more comfort. I use them for 12 hours shifts as an emergency nurse. They were actually more uncomfortable. They were definitely warmer.",3
5/23/2020,"I really like this product, and intended to use them as an alternative to house slippers that fall off as I walk. But... be aware that the Baya style may fit a bit differently that standard Crocs. I have a high instep, and these were just enough tighter across the top of my foot that I had to return them. The next size up was not available at the time. I appreciate the prepaid return label that allowed me to send them back, but would love to have been able to keep and use them. Nice product, just didn't fit me as I hoped and needed.",3
12/31/2020,First time I purchased these type of Crocs. They are ok. They run my foot the wrong way and has left a blister. I am hoping that they will get better.,3
12/31/2020,I purchased for a gift and she loved them but the lining makes them too tight. They are going back I purchased 2 other pair not lined and they are awesome,3
5/18/2020,These ran smaller because of the lining and that should be adjusted in the manufacturing or mentioned that we should order a larger size. The lined crocs fit tighter.,3
12/13/2019,I use Crocs everyday. I ordered a size larger because I noticed that the ad said they run small but they're still too small and narrow so they'll probably just sit in my closet,3
12/15/2019,"Not the most comfortable Crocs. The inside lining was very nice but the rubber was more rigid than others I have owned. Ended up returning these. Still love Crocs, just not this particular pair.",3
1/25/2020,These are great for winter. They keep you warm. My only complaint is that would be that the lining doesn't stay laid down very well on the edges which is very annoying.,3
5/10/2020,Absolutely love them and knowing I would wear them when it was cold I ordered a size up and they were still to small. And by the time I got them they were sold out of all similar options! Was going to return them but accidentally threw out the tag!!,3
11/6/2020,These were really cute but too small for me. I returned them but have not received my refund. Please send refund and I can consider rebuying in a different size.,3
5/9/2020,The metal part holding the strap was rubbing on my foot. I took them off the shoes. I've ordered this type of style before and didn't have that problem.,3
12/15/2019,Nice looking. Just fit a bit too small for a size six as my heels feel a bit bothered by the back. Will see if I can get more comfortable breaking them in. I expected more cushioning.,3
5/12/2020,Very comfortable clog. I use as slippers around the house. Have found over a month of use that the lining isn't as durable as I'd like. Will stick with unlined crocs.,3
10/28/2020,"I love the color, I love the warmth! But I will say that they run kind of small, I don't know if I got an off pair but I got my usual size but my heels get uncomfortable because they are pushed all the way to the back :/",3
1/2/2021,"Service is very good but because of the fur lining my son needs wider as it was too tight on top. I called and was told they do not carry wide, very disappointing.",3
2/22/2020,"they stick to things they rub up against ....and the toe box is longer than regular shoes and causes me bump into chair legs, etc. Other than those things, they are cozy and comfortable.",3
11/13/2021,This is my first pair of crocs I purchased; my first pair was a purchased size error handed down by a friend. My new pair feels like a tighter fit than my others; hoping they will stretch out a bit. The comfort is what sold me on these amazing shoes,3
11/9/2021,"The crocs are just as described. I am disappointed though, that they arrived in a clear plastic bag instead of a box. Minus 2 stars for not arriving in a shoe box.",3
3/11/2021,"As recommended, I ordered a size 7 since I wear a 7 1/2. However, after wearing them twice they are not comfortable and feel snugged. I wish I had ordered a size up instead of a size down. Money wasted",3
12/29/2020,"The color, lining and style are all great but the sizing is not right, I'm not sure if the lining has something to do with the sizing but I need to return the product for one size bigger",3
12/31/2020,They are too big. I'm trying to return them but the website is not user friendly. I called and was told a return label will be emailed to me within 24 hours. It's over 48 hours and. I have not received it.,3
12/28/2020,"Super comfy. The only issue is that I have wide feet, and these are narrower than the traditional crocs. They rub a little on my feet. I'd they were wider I would give them 5 stars.",3
3/18/2020,"To replace house slippers. Cozy, warm and easy off/on. But fit very snug/small and pinch in on sides compared to other Crocs I own so not as comfortable/enjoyable. Hoping they will stretch out over time but not so far.",3
10/25/2020,I love that they are lined and fuzzy. But the Baya line hurts the top of my foot right at the opening. Hoping they will soften up. I guess I should stick with the classic clog from now on.,3
12/10/2020,Not comfortable. Had to return. I've been wearing crocs since you first came out with them. They are my most comfortable shoes. But something was wrong with this pair. I had to return them.,3
5/29/2020,I believe I bought the wrong size so I gave them to someone who needed them more than me which made me feel good. I'm pretty sure they were a good price also.,3
3/22/2020,They didn't have women's size 8 so bought these. Size wise ok but very big toe box. Not a good fit for a women's foot. Also not as fluffy and cushiony as I had hoped.,3
2/27/2020,"They are cute but not comfortable, I bought them because I work In the pharmacy needed something for my feet cute and comfortable however they are just cute.",3
2/25/2022,"Line the look, and the lining but also because of the lining on the inside the shoes didn't fit well. Would be better if they made this one in half size.",3
12/6/2021,"I love the color of these, and the fuzzy lining is super soft. But overall I don't like the fit of the Baya clog as much as I do the classic. It's not as comfortable.",3
4/22/2020,"This is my third pair of this Baya lined style. Ordered same size as always but it is appreciatively smaller than previous two pair. I will probably NOT buy this product again, if sizing has become inconsistent.",3
5/18/2020,These ran smaller because of the lining and that should be adjusted in the manufacturing or mentioned that we should order a larger size. I wear a 9 in non-lined crocs. The lined crocs fit tighter.,3
12/11/2022,"I usually buy classic clogs and didn't realize this was Baya. Unfortunately it hurts my toe and feels short. The lining keeps the foot warm so if you plan on getting this style, I'd recommend going up a half size than usual.",3
11/10/2021,It's cut a little smaller than the unlined shoe. I bought the same size as I usually buy the unlined and it fits tighter.,3
11/23/2020,Not sure if it's just my feet but the lining makes one of the shoes fit tighter. I had to go up in size,3
12/16/2022,I Absolutely love crocs but the 5 week delivery time is where I had an issue and no answers to where your shipment was is frustrating.,3
12/28/2020,"I ordered the size that I ordered my classic Crocs in but these are bigger. They are very pretty, I love the way they look.",3
12/29/2020,The strap is secured with two metal staves which really hurt! So if you take those out they are great. But you can't wear them as they are.,3
1/26/2021,They are ok ! I don't like the style and after a while of wearing them. One side of my foot starts bothering me,3
11/13/2020,There was a black plastic hook holding the shoes together pulled one of the wholes down on the shoes mis shaping the top of the shoe.,3
12/16/2020,They are cute and comfy. But I got a size up because people said they run small but they are a little big on me.,3
12/15/2019,The crocs were a little to big for comfort and kept sliding around . Not sure if I had chose that size or not,3
3/26/2020,I like them but they hurt me between the toes. Not comfortable for that reason. I cannot wear them!!,3
5/14/2020,they are good but not that good . when i take my feet out the lining come out also . so i have to keep stuff it back in .,3
5/18/2020,These did not fit me but I did order the only size available which was one size smaller my regular size my doing of course,3
1/1/2021,Looks really nice just wish it was wider on the sides its too tight for my feet. Too small I needed to size bigger.....,3
12/30/2020,"The are much tighter in the toes than expected, I can't wear them so they will just sit in the closet",3
11/17/2021,"I was so excited to wear these but unfortunately the left shoe is much smaller than the right, so I have to return them.",3
12/15/2020,"Bought these for my husband,, he wears 11 3wide so I ordered a 12 but they were way to tight, he could barely get his foot in them..",3
5/29/2020,"I like these, but the left shoe was a little tight. I'm shopping with stretching it, it will fit like my right. Maybe it was just a fluke.",3
4/11/2021,I have previously bought crocs size 11 however these seemed smaller I recommend ordering a size bigger. They were nice over all I had to regift.,3
12/7/2022,Were tow pairs but classified as presents but came together in a box that can't be use to rap for individual present,3
12/26/2020,Love my new lined crocks. Using them for indoor shoes/ slippers around the house. Trying to adopt the habit of leaving outdoors shoes outside so the house stays cleaner. These are easy on & off. Wish they were maybe a little bit bigger for thick socks this winter.,4
1/18/2021,I absolutely love them. I wear them 24/7 when I'm not at work. They are so comfortable. The only thing to remember is there are shaped different then the original clog. The toe region is made to look bigger and it threw me off a little.,4
12/17/2022,"I brought these for indoor use. Went 1 size up. The lining is very thin but soft. My feet normally swear in slippers, but in these my feet stay nice and dry.",4
11/14/2021,I really love my shoes only problem the fuzzy padding is not removable to wash,4
12/13/2019,The warmth is great and comfortability but the seam for the heel is coming off on the inside so the fur isn't sticking to the croc anymore.,4
12/19/2020,Love the print ! But wish that the Sherpa was softer and thicker. I wear them in the house more then usual now a day's.❤️,4
12/27/2020,Bought this product for my step daughter and she loves them. She wanted gray but they were sold out.,4
12/28/2020,Ppl said get a bigger size. I didnt need that. So mine are a little big. But. They are warm and super comfy.,4
11/3/2023,I returned this clog only because I was looking for the cushiony feeling of standing on my feet for long periods and this specific clog did not have the bouncy cushion I was looking for. It was very comfortable and warm but not for my achy feet standing for long periods of time,4
5/22/2020,I like the floral design and it's very comfortable.,4
9/29/2023,"I bought these crocs, I like them and wear them a lot. But I read the reviews before buying them and many reviews said buy one size larger. Well I did but they feel really big thankfully they don't slip off. So I wouldn't buy them a size bigger again.",4
12/24/2023,My son loved the lined Crocs but hated the tie-dye.  The picture appears darker with more blue than the actual.  He's keeping them but wish they had more solid dark colors when I was purchasing them. Otherwise they are awesome.,4
12/5/2023,"I love the Baya style and have several pairs of Crocs. This is my first pair of ""lined"" Crocs. They run a bit smaller; probably because they are lined. Still extremely comfortable. Great price point. I ordered two pairs!",4
11/30/2023,I liked the color but didn't order the right size.  Shoes are a hard fit to order because every maker is different on their sizes it is hard to figure out what  size you actually need.,4
11/18/2023,I love the lining for fall and maybe winter! I am a little unhappy that I couldn't figure out exchange so I paid $5 more. They pinch a little compaired to a past set I had bought but I think that will correct in time. I love the color!!,4
12/6/2023,"I love Crocs and have several pairs, but this is my first time ordering lined Crocs. They fit very snug, but I have a wide foot. If you have a wider foot, you may want to order a size up. These are very warm and comfortable.",4
1/10/2024,Mom loves them but runs larger than it should. Ordered another pair and her exact size was accurate.,4
1/5/2024,I ordered my size but I think they run small. But other than that they are great. Very soft and warm and comfortable,4
12/30/2023,they fit very well my son loved them I like the fact that they were insulated name brand it's a great deal,4
1/11/2024,These are lined shoes and I worried that it may make my feet smell but nope! Going on five months and no smell and so comfy!,4
8/15/2023,I loved the color but they ran a little large. I needed to downsize one size. Crocs slides are a great staple and handy to slip on when I walk my dog!,4
11/10/2021,They run small.,4
1/10/2021,Love them so comfy,4
6/23/2023,"I love CROCS, The original, black clog. This white clog has a lining and it makes the fit a little snug. I got these because I got a great deal on the price and wanted to try the lined clog for winter. I'm sure it'll stretch out so I can wear socks in the winter to take the trash out. Everyone needs a pair of Crocs at their front and back doors. When you have to hit the garage or the deck, you need something on your feet. These are the best for the job.",4
11/3/2023,"Crocs are my favorite for all occasions at my age (93). The lining , tho I thought a good idea, makes putting them on difficult.",4
12/13/2023,I have Crocs flip flops and the soles are exceptionally soft and supportive. These are hard and look incredibly huge across the toe area.,4
1/4/2024,I wear crocks a lot. These are warm but a bit tight probably due to the lining.,4
1/15/2024,Ugly AF but works since she cannot bend to tie her shoes. Great price,4
1/14/2024,Shoe runs small to size . Had to return it and buy a bigger size.,4
1/2/2024,Love them but add an extra half size as they are smaller then non lined crocks!,4
12/28/2023,Just a bit smaller in the fit due to the lining.,4
10/19/2023,"So comfy. Lots of compliments. One issue, the left one squeaks every step I take!! Kind of annoying!",4
10/2/2023,Cute and comfy but the soft liner tamps down too quickly when you begin to wear them. Wish it had a more durable inner layer.,4
9/30/2023,"I like the color and design on them. Like other reviewers, different colors can run smaller or larger. I wear an 8 and they are a little snug.",4
7/26/2023,"I believe I ordered a different brand last winter. These are just a bit large, but with socks, they should fit fine.",4
12/27/2023,run slightly small possibly due to the lining,4
12/7/2023,Not as comfortable as I thought they would be. Only got them cause they were on sale.,4
12/22/2023,They are great. Very comfortable and the lining is warm. So versatile,4
12/2/2023,These have fleece lining and help keep you warmer. The fit is right on!,4
11/21/2023,Great except it rubbed on my foot and made a blister. It's still not healed.,4
12/5/2023,Foot Size is on point the fleece inside shoe is so soft .,4
12/11/2023,"Twice received wrong size .
Very Frustrating.",4
12/21/2023,"If you think you know what size Crocs you usually wear, go up a size or two.",4
12/10/2023,The size runs a little small.,4
10/15/2023,Very comfortable on my feet,4
10/17/2023,love the shoe but not the biggest fan of how the fur lining feels,4
9/16/2023,lining gets grass stuck in it,4
10/20/2023,liked the warm lining fit was good,4
9/9/2023,These are pretty beautiful,4
10/17/2023,"Nice and warm and comfortable, I use them as my house shoes.",4
10/24/2023,"sizes are not fitting, go up one size higher than normal on bisexuality crocs",4
3/14/2023,These crocs run a little short. I ordered a size 9 and these are more narrow than another brand (same size) my son gave me last Christmas.,4
4/10/2023,My granddaughter loves the shoes. I was surprised that they run small. I would have ordered a size bigger.,4
5/14/2020,This the 2nd pair of lined Crocs I have purchased. They are comfy and definitely keep your feet warm in the winter. I would say the only issue I have is that the liner is not removable and they take a few days to dry after hand washing.,4
1/1/2021,Purchased these for my son in law and they were too small. These were replacing his older ones and ordered the same size however these are going back because they were too small. :( Kinda disappointed with the inconsistancy of sizing as these were a gift.,4
12/5/2021,"4 stars . When I first got them , they barley even fit me . They felt like they ran small . I even got a blister on the side of my foot from trying so hard to make them fit and wear them. I stopped using them for a few days disappointed because of how they fit. I'm a true size 7 in women's in every single shoe that I own. Different brands same size . So I found it wierd . But after a few more tries of trying to make them fit , once my blister went away I gave them another shot and I broke into them. Since they have fluffy fur inside I belive it shrinks the shoe so you have to wear them a bit to flatten the fur if that makes sense. Now I wear them comfortably , I still would recommend sizing up a size though.",4
12/13/2020,"I wear these in the house. They are warm, veryyy comfortable and easy to put on and take off. The bad thing is they majorly squeak when you walk. I have wood laminate flooring in my livingroom and vinyl flooring in the rest of the house and they squeak on both of these surfaces. We tried rubbing the soles with fabric softner sheets and we've tried sanding the bottoms. They still squeak big time!!!",4
12/31/2020,"Bought these for a friend, he says they're his new favorite shoes. The only complaint is that his feet are sweltering after 30 minutes of wear; thats his own fault though, he asked for the fur lined ones and didn't take his tendency to run hot into consideration. He would recommend, says ""they're swaggy"".",4
1/8/2021,"They are mostly comfortable and much warmer than my original Crocs. They are a bit stiff and even though they are a whole size larger than I normally wear, my toes still touch the end when I walk. Still, they are warmer and that's why I ordered them.",4
12/14/2019,Super cute shoes. The only issue is the instep is tight with the addition of the fuzzy lining. I wear a women's size 7 in crocs and the unlined version fits comfortably. I have been wearing these consistently and they are feeling looser on my feet. I would not size up unless the instep is way too tight.,4
5/14/2020,I love them the print is cute they feel comfortable it's just they were a little tight compared to the usual size 8 i get they didn't get loose until i broke them in and by then i had lost some of its furry fluffiness which was upsetting because i would've like for the fluffiness to have comfortably last longer,4
12/31/2020,Great Crocs product. I would expect no less. BUT buyer beware that the fleece lining in these makes them fit way more snugly I went up a size in this pair for my son and could have gone up two sizes but 13 was the largest size available. Otherwise he loves them !,4
12/17/2020,"The only downside I have for these is that I wish I could've got a 10 instead of a 9, of course I'm that awkward in between size and the non-fleece lined crocs fit perfect at a 9 but these are just a tad too short for my heels they almost fall out. But none the less I still wear em, hoping the fleece will push down and give some more room!",4
4/25/2021,love the style and comfort. The one drawback for me is the sizing is a bit small. Have others the same size and they don't seem quite as snug. Feel like they could be a little longer in the toe for more room. I will wear them and hope that They break in a bit.,4
3/6/2020,"I'm in Vail, CO and I wear these every day (mostly at night, after skiing). They're replacing a pair that finally wore out after several years. The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because there was a weird piece of wire in the instep, which I was going to try to cut out. After several wearings though, it became a moot point.",4
1/6/2021,"Bought these for my son's girlfriend. She wears a seven and the reviews said to order your size and not size up due to the lining. Her heel is tight up against the back of the shoe. She said they were ok, hoping they will squish down a little bit for a better fit. The color is very pretty, however.",4
12/20/2020,Baya crocs fit tight. I got two pairs one of the regular lined crocs and then these ones and I've noticed that my other ones fit better than these ones and they are both the same size and got them at the same time. Other than that they are super cute and cozy!,4
5/13/2021,"They are great looking, love the lined version of this. I wear a 7 1/2 and had ordered a 7 a year ago and had to send back as I figured the 8 would've been to big. Thought perhaps with the lining it would've made it just right. I do love them however... they are like all crocks of this style in that my 2nd toe is just a little longer than my big toe and it hits the top of the shoe. These are the only brand shoes that I have trouble with. I will wear these as the are super cool looking and almost super comfortable except for the uncomfortable part of my 2nd toe hitting the top",4
1/2/2021,I bought these for my husband and he says they are comfortable with the cushion. He really like the shoes and would recommend. He wears larger size shoes and 13 in men's was the biggest size we could find. He says they are a bit smaller on his feet but can still wear.,4
1/18/2021,"I love these crocs and they are nice and toasty! However I am bothered by the inside of the right shoe on the left side near where the strap attaches. It rubs and hurts so I can't wear for very long, Im hoping I can break them in. This is my new pair but the first pair did the same thing except much worse.",4
12/17/2020,"These run small, and that makes me sad! I love that they keep my feet warm, but my toes touch the end and they aren't too comfortable. There are no holes or gaps on the side of the clog (like the original non-lined clogs) so if you are walking outside in wet grass or in the rain your feet won't get wet from leaking through!",4
12/3/2020,Shipped fast. They came with an indention I had to stretch out to prevent blisters at the inside of my right foot. For the most part comfortable. Needs a more natural material lining to prevent sweating. I wear them with a thin wool sock and it prevents this. Overall I enjoy them.,4
12/9/2019,"My mom had bought these shoes in the burgundy color and when she got them I tried them on and loved them. I went ahead and got a pair in brown, I was a little disappointed because they were not quiet as comfortable as hers. Seemed like there were a few spots that they rubbed, but after deciding to keep them they are starting to finally give a little.",4
1/4/2021,They are very warm! I bought them for my husband since he gets cold easily. They are extremely comfortable as well! I did try them on and if my feet didn't sweat as much as they do or if they had more breath-ability (which i think would defeat the purpose of keeping your foot warm) I would get these.,4
12/15/2022,I can't wear the original crocs because I'm in between sizes but these fit ok. I'm an 8 1/2 in shoe size for reference and I got these in size 8. There's no arch support but they are comfortable to walk around in and I love the fleece lining. I was worried that it would make my feet hot but I haven't had any trouble with that. Great for cold weather.,4
1/11/2021,"They're much more comfortable with the fur inside them opposed to the ones without, coming from a girl with flat feet + knee issues + scoliosis and needs support in her shoes. I will say on the right shoe, the material that holds the strap seemed to rub a little bit causing a bit of a indent on my foot which was a little annoying when I wore them to work but overall they feel just fine and are pretty warm!",4
12/18/2019,"Super comfortable but I am not a fan of the basic croc look. I mainly bought them to wear around the house. I love the lined croc, feels like a good supportive slipper! Also I am usually a 9.5 so I went up to the 10 and they make my feet look huge! But around the house...I don't care. I just wanted comfort and I got it with the Baya Lined Clog.",4
12/12/2020,"I wear crocs a-lot. I bought these to replace a similar pair I have had for years. I have one issue which is that the right one seems to rub a bit on the inside right where the ""button"" for the strap is. I think maybe it is doing this because the pair was smashed into my mailbox and was there for an extra day because I didn't check my mail the day they came. I have tried to pull it out a bit and doesn't seem to be enough of an issue. It just might be nice if they sent them in something a bit more sturdy than the bags.",4
12/13/2019,"I love the comfort of these lined Crocs, but I am a true 8 1/2 and they do not come in half sizes. As I read the reviews, some said they ran a little small. That is not true in my case. I even had thick socks on the the strap in the back and it was still loose. That is the only problem I have with them. They are very good quality and comfy.",4
4/23/2020,Nice shoes/slippers. They run big. I should have returned them for a smaller size but see that people were being charged $6 for returns (I bought 2 pair). Not paying $12 - I can wear them. They are a mens 7/ladies 9. I normally buy sneakers in a mens 8.,4
12/14/2022,"Wanted to love these, but there was a problem with the inner side of the right shoe, it rubbed on the side of my foot, made it very uncomfortable to wear! I was able to regift them. I have never had this problem with any other Crocs and I have had many pairs.",4
5/12/2020,"Everytime I walk out to my garden, I slip these on. They conveniently wait for me on the tile floor at my sunroom door. If they get muddy, I simply rinse them off with the hose and take them off on the tile floor! No muss. No fuss. While I LOVE the soft lining on chilly dawns, I wish it was removable to wash separately in the washer.",4
12/29/2020,"Overall, I love this shoe. It keeps my feet very warm and I'm always cold! I am an 8 1/2 and bought a 9. Perfect size. Vietnam made. Yes, this matters because sizing is not uniform in different countries with this particular brand. The shoe doesn't have the squish feel of regular crocs even though the description says it has the same comfort system. I'm not entirely sure about that. I do wish the liner was removable to wash it and because things can fall in the little holes and then it's a pain getting it out. Also would like it if crocs weren't priced so high. For a basically molded rubber shoe, it costs them hardly anything to make.",4
2/26/2020,"Overall I like the product. They are comfortable. They do run small or true to size. Unfortunately they dont come in half sizes. That's the little room that's needed. Ordering the next size up would make them too big in my opinion. Liner is not removable. I like the shoe. They are cute, comfortable and provide the support I need.",4
11/15/2020,"The tracking and delivery SUCKED!!!!!!! The tracking system kept saying ""will be delivered today"" and never happended!!! No communication from CROCS. I had to inquire about it myself and when I did no reason was given or no information to what was happening was given. Get it together CROCS!!! The shoe is great and I love it. I ordered my normal shoe size and I can wear footies or no socks and still very comfortable.",4
12/7/2021,I got a size 8 my regular crocs love them since I wear 8 1/2 .....I had room in them but the bays lined clog crocs I got the same size 8 and it's a little tight not sure its because the fur the inside the shoes but that's my only complain about them I should've gotten an 9 instead,4
11/9/2020,"I normally give all my Crocs a 5-star. However, I have found that this style of Croc feels a tad bit smaller than normal. I wear an 11 womens, but it almost feels like a 10-1/2 size. It's not worth the hassle to return, but if I had to wear them for work, my feet would not feel good after extended wear. I don't know if it's the lining that is making them feel a little bit smaller or I just got a pair that was not constructed properly. I do wear them and do like them....this is my only beef about these clogs.",4
10/12/2020,"Love the color and fit. Very comfortable, cozy. I ordered a size up because of the lining, but may not have been necessary. I usually wear a size 8 in Crocs(8.5 in regular shoes), so I ordered a size 9 in this pair, but the size 8 would have fit fine. Maybe in colder weather with heavy socks, 9 might be better. I wish the lining could be removed for easy washing. All in all, I do like this pair.",4
4/21/2020,"This is a great Croc and very comfortable. Everything you love about Crocs is still found in this shoe. The reason for 4 stars, instead of 5, is simply because the liner on the inside is already pretty worn down after only a few wears. Its not wearing away, it is just getting less fluffy. Still a great warm shoe.",4
3/14/2020,"Fits great and are comfortable to wear. I have two pair one to wear around the house and the other to wear casually to the store, gym ect as long it's not wet out. The only negative is my feet sweat in them with or without socks. May be a good idea to go up a size next time to allow feet to breath.",4
3/11/2021,"Great shoes. Love the casual slipper feel, but also good if I need to take something outside. The fleece lining adds a coziness that I really enjoy in the cool months. The only drawback for me is the location of the strap attachment on the inside of the shoe really presses into my foot. I have a little bit of a prominent bone there, but have never had trouble with other shoes or previous Crocs. Not sure what happened there. If I press outward on that part of the shoe before I put it on, the discomfort is lessened. I still love the shoe, just would've picked a slightly different style if I were trying them on in person.",4
12/16/2019,"Very comfortable, gets matted over time but this is expected. Best worn with socks because it is very insulated and might cause your feet to sweat. Also best used as inside slippers. Dust and particles from the street can easily get stuck in the lining which will make it uncomfortable unless you are able to remove it thoroughly. As for aesthetics, these are way bulkier looking than the classic clog but that is expected when accommodating the extra materials used. Nice winter slipper. Would rather wear thick fuzzy socks and my classic clogs but since I already purchased these, I use them occasionally.",4
12/13/2019,"Nice, comfortable shoe except for the hard bump that is on the inside of where the strap attaches, it rubs on the side of my foot. The bump is on both shoes, so at least it's consistent! Not sure how I'm gonna fix it, maybe wearing more to break them in, don't know. Wish the lining was removable for washing occasionally.",4
12/17/2019,"I bought these for my roommate after her doctor told her that the best shoes to walk around the house with when you have foot problems are Crocs. Her feet are always cold so I bought the lined pair, she thinks they are ugly but her feet seem to hurt less.",4
3/8/2023,Might want order 1 size larger because of lining causing snug fit,4
3/12/2023,"Love these crocs. Great for winter time. Also, it doesnt dry out my feet like normal crocs.",4
4/2/2023,Comfy! Perfect for work! Just wish the inside fur wouldn't get so flat so quick:(,4
11/30/2021,The seem to fit tighter than my normal crocs. Wish I could have ordered 14s but 13 was the biggest available,4
12/8/2019,"I love these shoes, this is my third pair. I highly recommend these, my only complaint is I wish that I could take the liner out so that I could wash it.",4
