# Machine Learning Adversarial Attacks

## Our Intentions

+ With this project we intend to build a SQL database of web-scraped reviews on an alcohol delivery website and use the gathered data to train a model to classify the reviews as either positive or negative based on the star rating and key words within the review. We are aiming for at least 75% accuracy in this original model.
+ We will then use an adversarial attack recipe in order to poison the dataset within the code and use TextAttack to significantly reduce the accuracy of the model. 
+ we will then use visualizations from the original and attacked models to show how the model changes the view of the data to manipulate it.
